Multi-byte support				*multibyte* *multi-byte*
						*Chinese* *Japanese* *Korean*
This is about editing text in languages which have many characters that can
not be represented using one byte (one octet).  Examples are Chinese, Japanese
and Korean.  Unicode is also covered here.

For an introduction to the most common features, see |usr_45.txt| in the user
manual.
For changing the language of messages and menus see |mlang.txt|.

==============================================================================
1. Getting started					*mbyte-first*

This is a summary of the multibyte features in Vim.  If you are lucky it works
as described and you can start using Vim without much trouble.  If something
doesn't work you will have to read the rest.  Don't be surprised if it takes
quite a bit of work and experimenting to make Vim use all the multi-byte
features.  Unfortunately, every system has its own way to deal with multibyte
languages and it is quite complicated.


COMPILING

If you already have a compiled Vim program, check if the |+multi_byte| feature
is included.  The |:version| command can be used for this.

If +multi_byte is not included, you should compile Vim with "normal", "big" or
"huge" features.  You can further tune what features are included.  See the
INSTALL files in the source directory.


LOCALE

First of all, you must make sure your current locale is set correctly.  If
your system has been installed to use the language, it probably works right
away.  If not, you can often make it work by setting the $LANG environment
variable in your shell: >

	setenv LANG ja_JP.EUC

Unfortunately, the name of the locale depends on your system.  Japanese might
also be called "ja_JP.EUCjp" or just "ja".  To see what is currently used: >

	:language

To change the locale inside Vim use: >

	:language ja_JP.EUC

Vim will give an error message if this doesn't work.  This is a good way to
experiment and find the locale name you want to use.  But it's always better
to set the locale in the shell, so that it is used right from the start.

See |mbyte-locale| for details.


ENCODING

If your locale works properly, Vim will try to set the 'encoding' option
accordingly.  If this doesn't work you can overrule its value: >

	:set encoding=utf-8

See |encoding-values| for a list of acceptable values.

The result is that all the text that is used inside Vim will be in this
encoding.  Not only the text in the buffers, but also in registers, variables,
etc.  This also means that changing the value of 'encoding' makes the existing
text invalid!  The text doesn't change, but it will be displayed wrong.

You can edit files in another encoding than what 'encoding' is set to.  Vim
will convert the file when you read it and convert it back when you write it.
See 'fileencoding', 'fileencodings' and |++enc|.


DISPLAY AND FONTS

If you are working in a terminal (emulator) you must make sure it accepts the
same encoding as which Vim is working with.  If this is not the case, you can
use the 'termencoding' option to make Vim convert text automatically.

For the GUI you must select fonts that work with the current 'encoding'.  This
is the difficult part.  It depends on the system you are using, the locale and
a few other things.  See the chapters on fonts: |mbyte-fonts-X11| for
X-Windows and |mbyte-fonts-MSwin| for MS-Windows.

For GTK+ 2, you can skip most of this section.  The option 'guifontset' does
no longer exist.  You only need to set 'guifont' and everything should "just
work".  If your system comes with Xft2 and fontconfig and the current font
does not contain a certain glyph, a different font will be used automatically
if available.  The 'guifontwide' option is still supported but usually you do
not need to set it.  It is only necessary if the automatic font selection does
not suit your needs.

For X11 you can set the 'guifontset' option to a list of fonts that together
cover the characters that are used.  Example for Korean: >

	:set guifontset=k12,r12

Alternatively, you can set 'guifont' and 'guifontwide'.  'guifont' is used for
the single-width characters, 'guifontwide' for the double-width characters.
Thus the 'guifontwide' font must be exactly twice as wide as 'guifont'.
Example for UTF-8: >

	:set guifont=-misc-fixed-medium-r-normal-*-18-120-100-100-c-90-iso10646-1
	:set guifontwide=-misc-fixed-medium-r-normal-*-18-120-100-100-c-180-iso10646-1

You can also set 'guifont' alone, Vim will try to find a matching
'guifontwide' for you.


INPUT

There are several ways to enter multi-byte characters:
- For X11 XIM can be used.  See |XIM|.
- For MS-Windows IME can be used.  See |IME|.
- For all systems keymaps can be used.  See |mbyte-keymap|.

The options 'iminsert', 'imsearch' and 'imcmdline' can be used to chose
the different input methods or disable them temporarily.

==============================================================================
2.  Locale						*mbyte-locale*

The easiest setup is when your whole system uses the locale you want to work
in.  But it's also possible to set the locale for one shell you are working
in, or just use a certain locale inside Vim.


WHAT IS A LOCALE?					*locale*

There are many of languages in the world.  And there are different cultures
and environments at least as much as the number of languages.	A linguistic
environment corresponding to an area is called "locale".  This includes
information about the used language, the charset, collating order for sorting,
date format, currency format and so on.  For Vim only the language and charset
really matter.

You can only use a locale if your system has support for it.  Some systems
have only a few locales, especially in the USA.  The language which you want
to use may not be on your system.  In that case you might be able to install
it as an extra package.  Check your system documentation for how to do that.

The location in which the locales are installed varies from system to system.
For example, "/usr/share/locale" or "/usr/lib/locale".  See your system's
setlocale() man page.

Looking in these directories will show you the exact name of each locale.
Mostly upper/lowercase matters, thus "ja_JP.EUC" and "ja_jp.euc" are
different.  Some systems have a locale.alias file, which allows translation
from a short name like "nl" to the full name "nl_NL.ISO_8859-1".

Note that X-windows has its own locale stuff.  And unfortunately uses locale
names different from what is used elsewhere.  This is confusing!  For Vim it
matters what the setlocale() function uses, which is generally NOT the
X-windows stuff.  You might have to do some experiments to find out what
really works.

							*locale-name*
The (simplified) format of |locale| name is:

	language
or	language_territory
or	language_territory.codeset

Territory means the country (or part of it), codeset means the |charset|.  For
example, the locale name "ja_JP.eucJP" means:
	ja	the language is Japanese
	JP	the country is Japan
	eucJP	the codeset is EUC-JP
But it also could be "ja", "ja_JP.EUC", "ja_JP.ujis", etc.  And unfortunately,
the locale name for a specific language, territory and codeset is not unified
and depends on your system.

Examples of locale name:
    charset	    language		  locale name ~
    GB2312	    Chinese (simplified)  zh_CN.EUC, zh_CN.GB2312
    Big5	    Chinese (traditional) zh_TW.BIG5, zh_TW.Big5
    CNS-11643	    Chinese (traditional) zh_TW
    EUC-JP	    Japanese		  ja, ja_JP.EUC, ja_JP.ujis, ja_JP.eucJP
    Shift_JIS	    Japanese		  ja_JP.SJIS, ja_JP.Shift_JIS
    EUC-KR	    Korean		  ko, ko_KR.EUC


USING A LOCALE

To start using a locale for the whole system, see the documentation of your
system.  Mostly you need to set it in a configuration file in "/etc".

To use a locale in a shell, set the $LANG environment value.  When you want to
use Korean and the |locale| name is "ko", do this:

    sh:    export LANG=ko
    csh:   setenv LANG ko

You can put this in your ~/.profile or ~/.cshrc file to always use it.

To use a locale in Vim only, use the |:language| command: >

	:language ko

Put this in your ~/.vimrc file to use it always.

Or specify $LANG when starting Vim:

   sh:    LANG=ko vim {vim-arguments}
   csh:	  env LANG=ko vim {vim-arguments}

You could make a small shell script for this.

==============================================================================
3.  Encoding				*mbyte-encoding*

Vim uses the 'encoding' option to specify how characters are identified and
encoded when they are used inside Vim.  This applies to all the places where
text is used, including buffers (files loaded into memory), registers and
variables.

							*charset* *codeset*
Charset is another name for encoding.  There are subtle differences, but these
don't matter when using Vim.  "codeset" is another similar name.

Each character is encoded as one or more bytes.  When all characters are
encoded with one byte, we call this a single-byte encoding.  The most often
used one is called "latin1".  This limits the number of characters to 256.
Some of these are control characters, thus even fewer can be used for text.

When some characters use two or more bytes, we call this a multi-byte
encoding.  This allows using much more than 256 characters, which is required
for most East Asian languages.

Most multi-byte encodings use one byte for the first 127 characters.  These
are equal to ASCII, which makes it easy to exchange plain-ASCII text, no
matter what language is used.  Thus you might see the right text even when the
encoding was set wrong.

							*encoding-names*
Vim can use many different character encodings.  There are three major groups:

1   8bit	Single-byte encodings, 256 different characters.  Mostly used
		in USA and Europe.  Example: ISO-8859-1 (Latin1).  All
		characters occupy one screen cell only.

2   2byte	Double-byte encodings, over 10000 different characters.
		Mostly used in Asian countries.  Example: euc-kr (Korean)
		The number of screen cells is equal to the number of bytes
		(except for euc-jp when the first byte is 0x8e).

u   Unicode	Universal encoding, can replace all others.  ISO 10646.
		Millions of different characters.  Example: UTF-8.  The
		relation between bytes and screen cells is complex.

Other encodings cannot be used by Vim internally.  But files in other
encodings can be edited by using conversion, see 'fileencoding'.
Note that all encodings must use ASCII for the characters up to 128 (except
when compiled for EBCDIC).

Supported 'encoding' values are:			*encoding-values*
1   latin1	8-bit characters (ISO 8859-1, also used for cp1252)
1   iso-8859-n	ISO_8859 variant (n = 2 to 15)
1   koi8-r	Russian
1   koi8-u	Ukrainian
1   macroman    MacRoman (Macintosh encoding)
1   8bit-{name} any 8-bit encoding (Vim specific name)
1   cp437	similar to iso-8859-1
1   cp737	similar to iso-8859-7
1   cp775	Baltic
1   cp850	similar to iso-8859-4
1   cp852	similar to iso-8859-1
1   cp855	similar to iso-8859-2
1   cp857	similar to iso-8859-5
1   cp860	similar to iso-8859-9
1   cp861	similar to iso-8859-1
1   cp862	similar to iso-8859-1
1   cp863	similar to iso-8859-8
1   cp865	similar to iso-8859-1
1   cp866	similar to iso-8859-5
1   cp869	similar to iso-8859-7
1   cp874	Thai
1   cp1250	Czech, Polish, etc.
1   cp1251	Cyrillic
1   cp1253	Greek
1   cp1254	Turkish
1   cp1255	Hebrew
1   cp1256	Arabic
1   cp1257	Baltic
1   cp1258	Vietnamese
1   cp{number}	MS-Windows: any installed single-byte codepage
2   cp932	Japanese (Windows only)
2   euc-jp	Japanese (Unix only)
2   sjis	Japanese (Unix only)
2   cp949	Korean (Unix and Windows)
2   euc-kr	Korean (Unix only)
2   cp936	simplified Chinese (Windows only)
2   euc-cn	simplified Chinese (Unix only)
2   cp950	traditional Chinese (on Unix alias for big5)
2   big5	traditional Chinese (on Windows alias for cp950)
2   euc-tw	traditional Chinese (Unix only)
2   2byte-{name} Unix: any double-byte encoding (Vim specific name)
2   cp{number}	MS-Windows: any installed double-byte codepage
u   utf-8	32 bit UTF-8 encoded Unicode (ISO/IEC 10646-1)
u   ucs-2	16 bit UCS-2 encoded Unicode (ISO/IEC 10646-1)
u   ucs-2le	like ucs-2, little endian
u   utf-16	ucs-2 extended with double-words for more characters
u   utf-16le	like utf-16, little endian
u   ucs-4	32 bit UCS-4 encoded Unicode (ISO/IEC 10646-1)
u   ucs-4le	like ucs-4, little endian

The {name} can be any encoding name that your system supports.  It is passed
to iconv() to convert between the encoding of the file and the current locale.
For MS-Windows "cp{number}" means using codepage {number}.
Examples: >
		:set encoding=8bit-cp1252
		:set encoding=2byte-cp932

The MS-Windows codepage 1252 is very similar to latin1.  For practical reasons
the same encoding is used and it's called latin1.  'isprint' can be used to
display the characters 0x80 - 0xA0 or not.

Several aliases can be used, they are translated to one of the names above.
An incomplete list:

1   ansi	same as latin1 (obsolete, for backward compatibility)
2   japan	Japanese: on Unix "euc-jp", on MS-Windows cp932
2   korea	Korean: on Unix "euc-kr", on MS-Windows cp949
2   prc		simplified Chinese: on Unix "euc-cn", on MS-Windows cp936
2   chinese     same as "prc"
2   taiwan	traditional Chinese: on Unix "euc-tw", on MS-Windows cp950
u   utf8	same as utf-8
u   unicode	same as ucs-2
u   ucs2be	same as ucs-2 (big endian)
u   ucs-2be	same as ucs-2 (big endian)
u   ucs-4be	same as ucs-4 (big endian)
u   utf-32	same as ucs-4
u   utf-32le	same as ucs-4le
    default     stands for the default value of 'encoding', depends on the
		environment

For the UCS codes the byte order matters.  This is tricky, use UTF-8 whenever
you can.  The default is to use big-endian (most significant byte comes
first):
	    name	bytes		char ~
	    ucs-2	      11 22	    1122
	    ucs-2le	      22 11	    1122
	    ucs-4	11 22 33 44	11223344
	    ucs-4le	44 33 22 11	11223344

On MS-Windows systems you often want to use "ucs-2le", because it uses little
endian UCS-2.

There are a few encodings which are similar, but not exactly the same.  Vim
treats them as if they were different encodings, so that conversion will be
done when needed.  You might want to use the similar name to avoid conversion
or when conversion is not possible:

	cp932, shift-jis, sjis
	cp936, euc-cn

							*encoding-table*
Normally 'encoding' is equal to your current locale and 'termencoding' is
empty.  This means that your keyboard and display work with characters encoded
in your current locale, and Vim uses the same characters internally.

You can make Vim use characters in a different encoding by setting the
'encoding' option to a different value.  Since the keyboard and display still
use the current locale, conversion needs to be done.  The 'termencoding' then
takes over the value of the current locale, so Vim converts between 'encoding'
and 'termencoding'.  Example: >
	:let &termencoding = &encoding
	:set encoding=utf-8

However, not all combinations of values are possible.  The table below tells
you how each of the nine combinations works.  This is further restricted by
not all conversions being possible, iconv() being present, etc.  Since this
depends on the system used, no detailed list can be given.

('tenc' is the short name for 'termencoding' and 'enc' short for 'encoding')

'tenc'	    'enc'	remark ~

 8bit	    8bit	Works.  When 'termencoding' is different from
			'encoding' typing and displaying may be wrong for some
			characters, Vim does NOT perform conversion (set
			'encoding' to "utf-8" to get this).
 8bit      2byte	MS-Windows: works for all codepages installed on your
			system; you can only type 8bit characters;
			Other systems: does NOT work.
 8bit	   Unicode	Works, but only 8bit characters can be typed directly
			(others through digraphs, keymaps, etc.); in a
			terminal you can only see 8bit characters; the GUI can
			show all characters that the 'guifont' supports.

 2byte	    8bit	Works, but typing non-ASCII characters might
			be a problem.
 2byte	   2byte	MS-Windows: works for all codepages installed on your
			system; typing characters might be a problem when
			locale is different from 'encoding'.
			Other systems: Only works when 'termencoding' is equal
			to 'encoding', you might as well leave it empty.
 2byte	   Unicode	works, Vim will translate typed characters.

 Unicode    8bit	works (unusual)
 Unicode    2byte	does NOT work
 Unicode   Unicode	works very well (leaving 'termencoding' empty works
			the same way, because all Unicode is handled
			internally as UTF-8)

CONVERSION						*charset-conversion*

Vim will automatically convert from one to another encoding in several places:
- When reading a file and 'fileencoding' is different from 'encoding'
- When writing a file and 'fileencoding' is different from 'encoding'
- When displaying characters and 'termencoding' is different from 'encoding'
- When reading input and 'termencoding' is different from 'encoding'
- When displaying messages and the encoding used for LC_MESSAGES differs from
  'encoding' (requires a gettext version that supports this).
- When reading a Vim script where |:scriptencoding| is different from
  'encoding'.
- When reading or writing a |viminfo| file.
Most of these require the |+iconv| feature.  Conversion for reading and
writing files may also be specified with the 'charconvert' option.

Useful utilities for converting the charset:
    All:	    iconv
	GNU iconv can convert most encodings.  Unicode is used as the
	intermediate encoding, which allows conversion from and to all other
	encodings.  See http://www.gnu.org/directory/libiconv.html.

    Japanese:	    nkf
	Nkf is "Network Kanji code conversion Filter".  One of the most unique
	facility of nkf is the guess of the input Kanji code.  So, you don't
	need to know what the inputting file's |charset| is.  When convert to
	EUC-JP from ISO-2022-JP or Shift_JIS, simply do the following command
	in Vim:
	    :%!nkf -e
	Nkf can be found at:
	http://www.sfc.wide.ad.jp/~max/FreeBSD/ports/distfiles/nkf-1.62.tar.gz

    Chinese:	    hc
	Hc is "Hanzi Converter".  Hc convert a GB file to a Big5 file, or Big5
	file to GB file.  Hc can be found at:
	ftp://ftp.cuhk.hk/pub/chinese/ifcss/software/unix/convert/hc-30.tar.gz

    Korean:	    hmconv
	Hmconv is Korean code conversion utility especially for E-mail.  It can
	convert between EUC-KR and ISO-2022-KR.  Hmconv can be found at:
	ftp://ftp.kaist.ac.kr/pub/hangul/code/hmconv/

    Multilingual:   lv
	Lv is a Powerful Multilingual File Viewer.  And it can be worked as
	|charset| converter.  Supported |charset|: ISO-2022-CN, ISO-2022-JP,
	ISO-2022-KR, EUC-CN, EUC-JP, EUC-KR, EUC-TW, UTF-7, UTF-8, ISO-8859
	series, Shift_JIS, Big5 and HZ.  Lv can be found at:
	http://www.ff.iij4u.or.jp/~nrt/lv/index.html


							*mbyte-conversion*
When reading and writing files in an encoding different from 'encoding',
conversion needs to be done.  These conversions are supported:
- All conversions between Latin-1 (ISO-8859-1), UTF-8, UCS-2 and UCS-4 are
  handled internally.
- For MS-Windows, when 'encoding' is a Unicode encoding, conversion from and
  to any codepage should work.
- Conversion specified with 'charconvert'
- Conversion with the iconv library, if it is available.
	Old versions of GNU iconv() may cause the conversion to fail (they
	request a very large buffer, more than Vim is willing to provide).
	Try getting another iconv() implementation.

							*iconv-dynamic*
On MS-Windows Vim can be compiled with the |+iconv/dyn| feature.  This means
Vim will search for the "iconv.dll" and "libiconv.dll" libraries.  When
neither of them can be found Vim will still work but some conversions won't be
possible.

==============================================================================
4. Using a terminal					*mbyte-terminal*

The GUI fully supports multi-byte characters.  It is also possible in a
terminal, if the terminal supports the same encoding that Vim uses.  Thus this
is less flexible.

For example, you can run Vim in a xterm with added multi-byte support and/or
|XIM|.  Examples are kterm (Kanji term) and hanterm (for Korean), Eterm
(Enlightened terminal) and rxvt.

If your terminal does not support the right encoding, you can set the
'termencoding' option.  Vim will then convert the typed characters from
'termencoding' to 'encoding'.  And displayed text will be converted from
'encoding' to 'termencoding'.  If the encoding supported by the terminal
doesn't include all the characters that Vim uses, this leads to lost
characters.  This may mess up the display.  If you use a terminal that
supports Unicode, such as the xterm mentioned below, it should work just fine,
since nearly every character set can be converted to Unicode without loss of
information.


UTF-8 IN XFREE86 XTERM					*UTF8-xterm*

This is a short explanation of how to use UTF-8 character encoding in the
xterm that comes with XFree86 by Thomas Dickey (text by Markus Kuhn).

Get the latest xterm version which has now UTF-8 support:

	http://invisible-island.net/xterm/xterm.html

Compile it with "./configure --enable-wide-chars ; make"

Also get the ISO 10646-1 version of various fonts, which is available on

	http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~mgk25/download/ucs-fonts.tar.gz

and install the font as described in the README file.

Now start xterm with >

  xterm -u8 -fn -misc-fixed-medium-r-semicondensed--13-120-75-75-c-60-iso10646-1
or, for bigger character: >
  xterm -u8 -fn -misc-fixed-medium-r-normal--15-140-75-75-c-90-iso10646-1

and you will have a working UTF-8 terminal emulator.  Try both >

   cat utf-8-demo.txt
   vim utf-8-demo.txt

with the demo text that comes with ucs-fonts.tar.gz in order to see
whether there are any problems with UTF-8 in your xterm.

For Vim you may need to set 'encoding' to "utf-8".

==============================================================================
5.  Fonts on X11					*mbyte-fonts-X11*

Unfortunately, using fonts in X11 is complicated.  The name of a single-byte
font is a long string.  For multi-byte fonts we need several of these...

Note: Most of this is no longer relevant for GTK+ 2.  Selecting a font via
its XLFD is not supported; see 'guifont' for an example of how to
set the font.  Do yourself a favor and ignore the |XLFD| and |xfontset|
sections below.

First of all, Vim only accepts fixed-width fonts for displaying text.  You
cannot use proportionally spaced fonts.  This excludes many of the available
(and nicer looking) fonts.  However, for menus and tooltips any font can be
used.

Note that Display and Input are independent.  It is possible to see your
language even though you have no input method for it.

You should get a default font for menus and tooltips that works, but it might
be ugly.  Read the following to find out how to select a better font.


X LOGICAL FONT DESCRIPTION (XLFD)
							*XLFD*
XLFD is the X font name and contains the information about the font size,
charset, etc.  The name is in this format:

FOUNDRY-FAMILY-WEIGHT-SLANT-WIDTH-STYLE-PIXEL-POINT-X-Y-SPACE-AVE-CR-CE

- SPACE:    SPACING field.
		p:  Proportional
		m:  Monospaced
		c:  CharCell
- AVE:	    AVERAGE_WIDTH field.  Ten times average width in pixels.
- CR:	    CHARSET_REGISTRY field.  The name of the charset group.
- CE:	    CHARSET_ENCODING field.  The rest of the charset name.  For some
	    charsets, such as JIS X 0208, if this field is 0, code points has
	    the same value as GL, and GR if 1.

For example, in case of a 16 dots font corresponding to JIS X 0208, it is
written like:
    -misc-fixed-medium-r-normal--16-110-100-100-c-160-jisx0208.1990-0


X FONTSET
						*fontset* *xfontset*
A single-byte charset is typically associated with one font.  For multi-byte
charsets a combination of fonts is often used.  This means that one group of
characters are used from one font and another group from another font (which
might be double wide).  This collection of fonts is called a fontset.

Which fonts are required in a fontset depends on the current locale.  X
windows maintains a table of which groups of characters are required for a
locale.  You have to specify all the fonts that a locale requires in the
'guifontset' option.

NOTE: The fontset always uses the current locale, even though 'encoding' may
be set to use a different charset.  In that situation you might want to use
'guifont' and 'guifontwide' instead of 'guifontset'.

Example:
    |charset| language		    "groups of characters" ~
    GB2312    Chinese (simplified)  ISO-8859-1 and GB 2312
    Big5      Chinese (traditional) ISO-8859-1 and Big5
    CNS-11643 Chinese (traditional) ISO-8859-1, CNS 11643-1 and CNS 11643-2
    EUC-JP    Japanese		    JIS X 0201 and JIS X 0208
    EUC-KR    Korean		    ISO-8859-1 and KS C 5601 (KS X 1001)

You can search for fonts using the xlsfonts command.  For example, when you're
searching for a font for KS C 5601: >
    xlsfonts | grep ksc5601

This is complicated and confusing.  You might want to consult the X-Windows
documentation if there is something you don't understand.

						*base_font_name_list*
When you have found the names of the fonts you want to use, you need to set
the 'guifontset' option.  You specify the list by concatenating the font names
and putting a comma in between them.

For example, when you use the ja_JP.eucJP locale, this requires JIS X 0201
and JIS X 0208.  You could supply a list of fonts that explicitly specifies
the charsets, like: >

 :set guifontset=-misc-fixed-medium-r-normal--14-130-75-75-c-140-jisx0208.1983-0,
	\-misc-fixed-medium-r-normal--14-130-75-75-c-70-jisx0201.1976-0

Alternatively, you can supply a base font name list that omits the charset
name, letting X-Windows select font characters required for the locale.  For
example: >

 :set guifontset=-misc-fixed-medium-r-normal--14-130-75-75-c-140,
	\-misc-fixed-medium-r-normal--14-130-75-75-c-70

Alternatively, you can supply a single base font name that allows X-Windows to
select from all available fonts.  For example: >

 :set guifontset=-misc-fixed-medium-r-normal--14-*

Alternatively, you can specify alias names.  See the fonts.alias file in the
fonts directory (e.g., /usr/X11R6/lib/X11/fonts/).  For example: >

 :set guifontset=k14,r14
<
							*E253*
Note that in East Asian fonts, the standard character cell is square.  When
mixing a Latin font and an East Asian font, the East Asian font width should
be twice the Latin font width.

If 'guifontset' is not empty, the "font" argument of the |:highlight| command
is also interpreted as a fontset.  For example, you should use for
highlighting: >
	:hi Comment font=english_font,your_font
If you use a wrong "font" argument you will get an error message.
Also make sure that you set 'guifontset' before setting fonts for highlight
groups.


USING RESOURCE FILES

Instead of specifying 'guifontset', you can set X11 resources and Vim will
pick them up.  This is only for people who know how X resource files work.

For Motif and Athena insert these three lines in your $HOME/.Xdefaults file:

	Vim.font: |base_font_name_list|
	Vim*fontSet: |base_font_name_list|
	Vim*fontList: your_language_font

Note: Vim.font is for text area.
      Vim*fontSet is for menu.
      Vim*fontList is for menu (for Motif GUI)

For example, when you are using Japanese and a 14 dots font, >

	Vim.font: -misc-fixed-medium-r-normal--14-*
	Vim*fontSet: -misc-fixed-medium-r-normal--14-*
	Vim*fontList: -misc-fixed-medium-r-normal--14-*
<
or: >

	Vim*font: k14,r14
	Vim*fontSet: k14,r14
	Vim*fontList: k14,r14
<
To have them take effect immediately you will have to do >

	xrdb -merge ~/.Xdefaults

Otherwise you will have to stop and restart the X server before the changes
take effect.


The GTK+ version of GUI Vim does not use .Xdefaults, use ~/.gtkrc instead.
The default mostly works OK.  But for the menus you might have to change
it.  Example: >

	style "default"
	{
		fontset="-*-*-medium-r-normal--14-*-*-*-c-*-*-*"
	}
	widget_class "*" style "default"

==============================================================================
6.  Fonts on MS-Windows				*mbyte-fonts-MSwin*

The simplest is to use the font dialog to select fonts and try them out.  You
can find this at the "Edit/Select Font..." menu.  Once you find a font name
that works well you can use this command to see its name: >

	:set guifont

Then add a command to your |gvimrc| file to set 'guifont': >

	:set guifont=courier_new:h12

==============================================================================
7.  Input on X11				*mbyte-XIM*

X INPUT METHOD (XIM) BACKGROUND			*XIM* *xim* *x-input-method*

XIM is an international input module for X.  There are two kinds of structures,
Xlib unit type and |IM-server| (Input-Method server) type.  |IM-server| type
is suitable for complex input, such as CJK.

- IM-server
							*IM-server*
  In |IM-server| type input structures, the input event is handled by either
  of the two ways: FrontEnd system and BackEnd system.  In the FrontEnd
  system, input events are snatched by the |IM-server| first, then |IM-server|
  give the application the result of input.  On the other hand, the BackEnd
  system works reverse order.  MS Windows adopt BackEnd system.  In X, most of
  |IM-server|s adopt FrontEnd system.  The demerit of BackEnd system is the
  large overhead in communication, but it provides safe synchronization with
  no restrictions on applications.

  For example, there are xwnmo and kinput2 Japanese |IM-server|, both are
  FrontEnd system.  Xwnmo is distributed with Wnn (see below), kinput2 can be
  found at: ftp://ftp.sra.co.jp/pub/x11/kinput2/

  For Chinese, there's a great XIM server named "xcin", you can input both
  Traditional and Simplified Chinese characters.  And it can accept other
  locale if you make a correct input table.  Xcin can be found at:
  http://cle.linux.org.tw/xcin/
  Others are scim: http://scim.freedesktop.org/ and fcitx:
  http://www.fcitx.org/

- Conversion Server
							*conversion-server*
  Some system needs additional server: conversion server.  Most of Japanese
  |IM-server|s need it, Kana-Kanji conversion server.  For Chinese inputting,
  it depends on the method of inputting, in some methods, PinYin or ZhuYin to
  HanZi conversion server is needed.  For Korean inputting, if you want to
  input Hanja, Hangul-Hanja conversion server is needed.

  For example, the Japanese inputting process is divided into 2 steps.  First
  we pre-input Hira-gana, second Kana-Kanji conversion.  There are so many
  Kanji characters (6349 Kanji characters are defined in JIS X 0208) and the
  number of Hira-gana characters are 76.  So, first, we pre-input text as
  pronounced in Hira-gana, second, we convert Hira-gana to Kanji or Kata-Kana,
  if needed.  There are some Kana-Kanji conversion server: jserver
  (distributed with Wnn, see below) and canna.  Canna can be found at:
  http://canna.sourceforge.jp/

There is a good input system: Wnn4.2.  Wnn 4.2 contains,
    xwnmo (|IM-server|)
    jserver (Japanese Kana-Kanji conversion server)
    cserver (Chinese PinYin or ZhuYin to simplified HanZi conversion server)
    tserver (Chinese PinYin or ZhuYin to traditional HanZi conversion server)
    kserver (Hangul-Hanja conversion server)
Wnn 4.2 for several systems can be found at various places on the internet.
Use the RPM or port for your system.


- Input Style
							*xim-input-style*
  When inputting CJK, there are four areas:
      1. The area to display of the input while it is being composed
      2. The area to display the currently active input mode.
      3. The area to display the next candidate for the selection.
      4. The area to display other tools.

  The third area is needed when converting.  For example, in Japanese
  inputting, multiple Kanji characters could have the same pronunciation, so
  a sequence of Hira-gana characters could map to a distinct sequence of Kanji
  characters.

  The first and second areas are defined in international input of X with the
  names of "Preedit Area", "Status Area" respectively.  The third and fourth
  areas are not defined and are left to be managed by the |IM-server|.  In the
  international input, four input styles have been defined using combinations
  of Preedit Area and Status Area: |OnTheSpot|, |OffTheSpot|, |OverTheSpot|
  and |Root|.

  Currently, GUI Vim supports three styles, |OverTheSpot|, |OffTheSpot| and
  |Root|.

*.  on-the-spot						*OnTheSpot*
    Preedit Area and Status Area are performed by the client application in
    the area of application.  The client application is directed by the
    |IM-server| to display all pre-edit data at the location of text
    insertion.  The client registers callbacks invoked by the input method
    during pre-editing.
*.  over-the-spot					*OverTheSpot*
    Status Area is created in a fixed position within the area of application,
    in case of Vim, the position is the additional status line.  Preedit Area
    is made at present input position of application.  The input method
    displays pre-edit data in a window which it brings up directly over the
    text insertion position.
*.  off-the-spot					*OffTheSpot*
    Preedit Area and Status Area are performed in the area of application, in
    case of Vim, the area is additional status line.  The client application
    provides display windows for the pre-edit data to the input method which
    displays into them directly.
*.  root-window						*Root*
    Preedit Area and Status Area are outside of the application.  The input
    method displays all pre-edit data in a separate area of the screen in a
    window specific to the input method.


USING XIM			*multibyte-input* *E284* *E286* *E287* *E288*
				*E285* *E289*

Note that Display and Input are independent.  It is possible to see your
language even though you have no input method for it.  But when your Display
method doesn't match your Input method, the text will be displayed wrong.

	Note: You can not use IM unless you specify 'guifontset'.
	      Therefore, Latin users, you have to also use 'guifontset'
	      if you use IM.

To input your language you should run the |IM-server| which supports your
language and |conversion-server| if needed.

The next 3 lines should be put in your ~/.Xdefaults file.  They are common for
all X applications which uses |XIM|.  If you already use |XIM|, you can skip
this. >

	*international: True
	*.inputMethod: your_input_server_name
	*.preeditType: your_input_style
<
input_server_name	is your |IM-server| name (check your |IM-server|
			manual).
your_input_style	is one of |OverTheSpot|, |OffTheSpot|, |Root|.  See
			also |xim-input-style|.

*international may not necessary if you use X11R6.
*.inputMethod and *.preeditType are optional if you use X11R6.

For example, when you are using kinput2 as |IM-server|, >

	*international: True
	*.inputMethod: kinput2
	*.preeditType: OverTheSpot
<
When using |OverTheSpot|, GUI Vim always connects to the IM Server even in
Normal mode, so you can input your language with commands like "f" and "r".
But when using one of the other two methods, GUI Vim connects to the IM Server
only if it is not in Normal mode.

If your IM Server does not support |OverTheSpot|, and if you want to use your
language with some Normal mode command like "f" or "r", then you should use a
localized xterm  or an xterm which supports |XIM|

If needed, you can set the XMODIFIERS environment variable:

	sh:  export XMODIFIERS="@im=input_server_name"
	csh: setenv XMODIFIERS "@im=input_server_name"

For example, when you are using kinput2 as |IM-server| and sh, >

	export XMODIFIERS="@im=kinput2"
<

FULLY CONTROLLED XIM

You can fully control XIM, like with IME of MS-Windows (see |multibyte-ime|).
This is currently only available for the GTK GUI.

Before using fully controlled XIM, one setting is required.  Set the
'imactivatekey' option to the key that is used for the activation of the input
method.  For example, when you are using kinput2 + canna as IM Server, the
activation key is probably Shift+Space: >

	:set imactivatekey=S-space

See 'imactivatekey' for the format.

==============================================================================
8.  Input on MS-Windows					*mbyte-IME*

(Windows IME support)				*multibyte-ime* *IME*

{only works Windows GUI and compiled with the |+multi_byte_ime| feature}

To input multibyte characters on Windows, you can use an Input Method Editor
(IME).  In process of your editing text, you must switch status (on/off) of
IME many many many times.  Because IME with status on is hooking all of your
key inputs, you cannot input 'j', 'k', or almost all of keys to Vim directly.

This |+multi_byte_ime| feature help this.  It reduce times of switch status of
IME manually.  In normal mode, there are almost no need working IME, even
editing multibyte text.  So exiting insert mode with ESC, Vim memorize last
status of IME and force turn off IME.  When re-enter insert mode, Vim revert
IME status to that memorized automatically.

This works on not only insert-normal mode, but also search-command input and
replace mode.
The options 'iminsert', 'imsearch' and 'imcmdline' can be used to chose
the different input methods or disable them temporarily.

WHAT IS IME
    IME is a part of East asian version Windows.  That helps you to input
    multibyte character.  English and other language version Windows does not
    have any IME.  (Also there is no need usually.) But there is one that
    called Microsoft Global IME.  Global IME is a part of Internet Explorer
    4.0 or above.  You can get more information about Global IME, at below
    URL.

WHAT IS GLOBAL IME					*global-ime*
    Global IME makes capability to input Chinese, Japanese, and Korean text
    into Vim buffer on any language version of Windows 98, Windows 95, and
    Windows NT 4.0.
    On Windows 2000 and XP it should work as well (without downloading).  On
    Windows 2000 Professional, Global IME is built in, and the Input Locales
    can be added through Control Panel/Regional Options/Input Locales.
    Please see below URL for detail of Global IME.  You can also find various
    language version of Global IME at same place.

    - Global IME detailed information.
	http://search.microsoft.com/results.aspx?q=global+ime

    - Active Input Method Manager (Global IME)
	http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa741221(v=VS.85).aspx

    Support for Global IME is an experimental feature.

NOTE: For IME to work you must make sure the input locales of your language
are added to your system.  The exact location of this depends on the version
of Windows you use.  For example, on my Windows 2000 box:
1. Control Panel
2. Regional Options
3. Input Locales Tab
4. Add Installed input locales -> Chinese(PRC)
   The default is still English (United Stated)


Cursor color when IME or XIM is on				*CursorIM*
    There is a little cute feature for IME.  Cursor can indicate status of IME
    by changing its color.  Usually status of IME was indicated by little icon
    at a corner of desktop (or taskbar).  It is not easy to verify status of
    IME.  But this feature help this.
    This works in the same way when using XIM.

    You can select cursor color when status is on by using highlight group
    CursorIM.  For example, add these lines to your |gvimrc|: >

	if has('multi_byte_ime')
	    highlight Cursor guifg=NONE guibg=Green
	    highlight CursorIM guifg=NONE guibg=Purple
	endif
<
    Cursor color with off IME is green.  And purple cursor indicates that
    status is on.

==============================================================================
9. Input with a keymap					*mbyte-keymap*

When the keyboard doesn't produce the characters you want to enter in your
text, you can use the 'keymap' option.  This will translate one or more
(English) characters to another (non-English) character.  This only happens
when typing text, not when typing Vim commands.  This avoids having to switch
between two keyboard settings.

The value of the 'keymap' option specifies a keymap file to use.  The name of
this file is one of these two:

	keymap/{keymap}_{encoding}.vim
	keymap/{keymap}.vim

Here {keymap} is the value of the 'keymap' option and {encoding} of the
'encoding' option.  The file name with the {encoding} included is tried first.

'runtimepath' is used to find these files.  To see an overview of all
available keymap files, use this: >
	:echo globpath(&rtp, "keymap/*.vim")

In Insert and Command-line mode you can use CTRL-^ to toggle between using the
keyboard map or not. |i_CTRL-^| |c_CTRL-^|
This flag is remembered for Insert mode with the 'iminsert' option.  When
leaving and entering Insert mode the previous value is used.  The same value
is also used for commands that take a single character argument, like |f| and
|r|.
For Command-line mode the flag is NOT remembered.  You are expected to type an
Ex command first, which is ASCII.
For typing search patterns the 'imsearch' option is used.  It can be set to
use the same value as for 'iminsert'.
								*lCursor*
It is possible to give the GUI cursor another color when the language mappings
are being used.  This is disabled by default, to avoid that the cursor becomes
invisible when you use a non-standard background color.  Here is an example to
use a brightly colored cursor: >
	:highlight Cursor guifg=NONE guibg=Green
	:highlight lCursor guifg=NONE guibg=Cyan
<
		*keymap-file-format* *:loadk* *:loadkeymap* *E105* *E791*
The keymap file looks something like this: >

	" Maintainer:	name <email@address>
	" Last Changed:	2001 Jan 1

	let b:keymap_name = "short"

	loadkeymap
	a	A
	b	B	comment

The lines starting with a " are comments and will be ignored.  Blank lines are
also ignored.  The lines with the mappings may have a comment after the useful
text.

The "b:keymap_name" can be set to a short name, which will be shown in the
status line.  The idea is that this takes less room than the value of
'keymap', which might be long to distinguish between different languages,
keyboards and encodings.

The actual mappings are in the lines below "loadkeymap".  In the example "a"
is mapped to "A" and "b" to "B".  Thus the first item is mapped to the second
item.  This is done for each line, until the end of the file.
These items are exactly the same as what can be used in a |:lnoremap| command,
using "<buffer>" to make the mappings local to the buffer.
You can check the result with this command: >
	:lmap
The two items must be separated by white space.  You cannot include white
space inside an item, use the special names "<Tab>" and "<Space>" instead.
The length of the two items together must not exceed 200 bytes.

It's possible to have more than one character in the first column.  This works
like a dead key.  Example: >
	'a	á
Since Vim doesn't know if the next character after a quote is really an "a",
it will wait for the next character.  To be able to insert a single quote,
also add this line: >
	''	'
Since the mapping is defined with |:lnoremap| the resulting quote will not be
used for the start of another character.
The "accents" keymap uses this.				*keymap-accents*

The first column can also be in |<>| form:
	<C-c>		Ctrl-C
	<A-c>		Alt-c
	<A-C>		Alt-C
Note that the Alt mappings may not work, depending on your keyboard and
terminal.

Although it's possible to have more than one character in the second column,
this is unusual.  But you can use various ways to specify the character: >
	A	a		literal character
	A	<char-97>	decimal value
	A	<char-0x61>	hexadecimal value
	A	<char-0141>	octal value
	x	<Space>		special key name

The characters are assumed to be encoded for the current value of 'encoding'.
It's possible to use ":scriptencoding" when all characters are given
literally.  That doesn't work when using the <char-> construct, because the
conversion is done on the keymap file, not on the resulting character.

The lines after "loadkeymap" are interpreted with 'cpoptions' set to "C".
This means that continuation lines are not used and a backslash has a special
meaning in the mappings.  Examples: >

	" a comment line
	\"	x	maps " to x
	\\	y	maps \ to y

If you write a keymap file that will be useful for others, consider submitting
it to the Vim maintainer for inclusion in the distribution:
<maintainer@vim.org>

10. Using UTF-8				*mbyte-utf8* *UTF-8* *utf-8* *utf8*
							*Unicode* *unicode*
The Unicode character set was designed to include all characters from other
character sets.  Therefore it is possible to write text in any language using
Unicode (with a few rarely used languages excluded).  And it's mostly possible
to mix these languages in one file, which is impossible with other encodings.

Unicode can be encoded in several ways.  The most popular one is UTF-8, which
uses one or more bytes for each character and is backwards compatible with
ASCII.   On MS-Windows UTF-16 is also used (previously UCS-2), which uses
16-bit words.  Vim can support all of these encodings, but always uses UTF-8
internally.

Vim has comprehensive UTF-8 support.  It works well in:
- xterm with utf-8 support enabled
- Athena, Motif and GTK GUI
- MS-Windows GUI
- several other platforms

Double-width characters are supported.  This works best with 'guifontwide' or
'guifontset'.  When using only 'guifont' the wide characters are drawn in the
normal width and a space to fill the gap.  Note that the 'guifontset' option
is no longer relevant in the GTK+ 2 GUI.

							*bom-bytes*
When reading a file a BOM (Byte Order Mark) can be used to recognize the
Unicode encoding:
	EF BB BF     utf-8
	FE FF        utf-16 big endian
	FF FE        utf-16 little endian
	00 00 FE FF  utf-32 big endian
	FF FE 00 00  utf-32 little endian

Utf-8 is the recommended encoding.  Note that it's difficult to tell utf-16
and utf-32 apart.  Utf-16 is often used on MS-Windows, utf-32 is not
widespread as file format.


					*mbyte-combining* *mbyte-composing*
A composing or combining character is used to change the meaning of the
character before it.  The combining characters are drawn on top of the
preceding character.
Up to two combining characters can be used by default.  This can be changed
with the 'maxcombine' option.
When editing text a composing character is mostly considered part of the
preceding character.  For example "x" will delete a character and its
following composing characters by default.
If the 'delcombine' option is on, then pressing 'x' will delete the combining
characters, one at a time, then the base character.  But when inserting, you
type the first character and the following composing characters separately,
after which they will be joined.  The "r" command will not allow you to type a
combining character, because it doesn't know one is coming.  Use "R" instead.

Bytes which are not part of a valid UTF-8 byte sequence are handled like a
single character and displayed as <xx>, where "xx" is the hex value of the
byte.

Overlong sequences are not handled specially and displayed like a valid
character.  However, search patterns may not match on an overlong sequence.
(an overlong sequence is where more bytes are used than required for the
character.)  An exception is NUL (zero) which is displayed as "<00>".

In the file and buffer the full range of Unicode characters can be used (31
bits).  However, displaying only works for the characters present in the
selected font.

Useful commands:
- "ga" shows the decimal, hexadecimal and octal value of the character under
  the cursor.  If there are composing characters these are shown too.  (If the
  message is truncated, use ":messages").
- "g8" shows the bytes used in a UTF-8 character, also the composing
  characters, as hex numbers.
- ":set encoding=utf-8 fileencodings=" forces using UTF-8 for all files.  The
  default is to use the current locale for 'encoding' and set 'fileencodings'
  to automatically detect the encoding of a file.


STARTING VIM

If your current locale is in an utf-8 encoding, Vim will automatically start
in utf-8 mode.

If you are using another locale: >

	set encoding=utf-8

You might also want to select the font used for the menus.  Unfortunately this
doesn't always work.  See the system specific remarks below, and 'langmenu'.


USING UTF-8 IN X-Windows				*utf-8-in-xwindows*

Note: This section does not apply to the GTK+ 2 GUI.

You need to specify a font to be used.  For double-wide characters another
font is required, which is exactly twice as wide.  There are three ways to do
this:

1. Set 'guifont' and let Vim find a matching 'guifontwide'
2. Set 'guifont' and 'guifontwide'
3. Set 'guifontset'

See the documentation for each option for details.  Example: >

   :set guifont=-misc-fixed-medium-r-normal--15-140-75-75-c-90-iso10646-1

You might also want to set the font used for the menus.  This only works for
Motif.  Use the ":hi Menu font={fontname}" command for this. |:highlight|


TYPING UTF-8						*utf-8-typing*

If you are using X-Windows, you should find an input method that supports
utf-8.

If your system does not provide support for typing utf-8, you can use the
'keymap' feature.  This allows writing a keymap file, which defines a utf-8
character as a sequence of ASCII characters.  See |mbyte-keymap|.

Another method is to set the current locale to the language you want to use
and for which you have a XIM available.  Then set 'termencoding' to that
language and Vim will convert the typed characters to 'encoding' for you.

If everything else fails, you can type any character as four hex bytes: >

	CTRL-V u 1234

"1234" is interpreted as a hex number.  You must type four characters, prepend
a zero if necessary.


COMMAND ARGUMENTS					*utf-8-char-arg*

Commands like |f|, |F|, |t| and |r| take an argument of one character.  For
UTF-8 this argument may include one or two composing characters.  These need
to be produced together with the base character, Vim doesn't wait for the next
character to be typed to find out if it is a composing character or not.
Using 'keymap' or |:lmap| is a nice way to type these characters.

The commands that search for a character in a line handle composing characters
as follows.  When searching for a character without a composing character,
this will find matches in the text with or without composing characters.  When
searching for a character with a composing character, this will only find
matches with that composing character.  It was implemented this way, because
not everybody is able to type a composing character.

11. Overview of options					*mbyte-options*

These options are relevant for editing multi-byte files.  Check the help in
options.txt for detailed information.

'encoding'	Encoding used for the keyboard and display.  It is also the
		default encoding for files.

'fileencoding'	Encoding of a file.  When it's different from 'encoding'
		conversion is done when reading or writing the file.

'fileencodings'	List of possible encodings of a file.  When opening a file
		these will be tried and the first one that doesn't cause an
		error is used for 'fileencoding'.

'charconvert'	Expression used to convert files from one encoding to another.

'formatoptions' The 'm' flag can be included to have formatting break a line
		at a multibyte character of 256 or higher.  Thus is useful for
		languages where a sequence of characters can be broken
		anywhere.

'guifontset'	The list of font names used for a multi-byte encoding.  When
		this option is not empty, it replaces 'guifont'.

'keymap'	Specify the name of a keyboard mapping.

		  VIM REFERENCE MANUAL    by Bram Moolenaar


				*Cmdline-mode* *Command-line-mode*
Command-line mode		*Cmdline* *Command-line* *mode-cmdline* *:*

Command-line mode is used to enter Ex commands (":"), search patterns
("/" and "?"), and filter commands ("!").

Basic command line editing is explained in chapter 20 of the user manual
|usr_20.txt|.

1. Command-line editing		|cmdline-editing|
2. Command-line completion	|cmdline-completion|
3. Ex command-lines		|cmdline-lines|
4. Ex command-line ranges	|cmdline-ranges|
5. Ex command-line flags	|ex-flags|
6. Ex special characters	|cmdline-special|
7. Command-line window		|cmdline-window|

==============================================================================
1. Command-line editing					*cmdline-editing*

Normally characters are inserted in front of the cursor position.  You can
move around in the command-line with the left and right cursor keys.  With the
<Insert> key, you can toggle between inserting and overstriking characters.
{Vi: can only alter the last character in the line}

Note that if your keyboard does not have working cursor keys or any of the
other special keys, you can use ":cnoremap" to define another key for them.
For example, to define tcsh style editing keys:		*tcsh-style*  >
	:cnoremap <C-A> <Home>
	:cnoremap <C-F> <Right>
	:cnoremap <C-B> <Left>
	:cnoremap <Esc>b <S-Left>
	:cnoremap <Esc>f <S-Right>
(<> notation |<>|; type all this literally)

							*cmdline-too-long*
When the command line is getting longer than what fits on the screen, only the
part that fits will be shown.  The cursor can only move in this visible part,
thus you cannot edit beyond that.

						*cmdline-history* *history*
The command-lines that you enter are remembered in a history table.  You can
recall them with the up and down cursor keys.  There are actually five
history tables:
- one for ':' commands
- one for search strings
- one for expressions
- one for input lines, typed for the |input()| function.
- one for debug mode commands
These are completely separate.  Each history can only be accessed when
entering the same type of line.
Use the 'history' option to set the number of lines that are remembered
(default: 50).
Notes:
- When you enter a command-line that is exactly the same as an older one, the
  old one is removed (to avoid repeated commands moving older commands out of
  the history).
- Only commands that are typed are remembered.  Ones that completely come from
  mappings are not put in the history.
- All searches are put in the search history, including the ones that come
  from commands like "*" and "#".  But for a mapping, only the last search is
  remembered (to avoid that long mappings trash the history).
{Vi: no history}
{not available when compiled without the |+cmdline_hist| feature}

There is an automatic completion of names on the command-line; see
|cmdline-completion|.

							*c_CTRL-V*
CTRL-V		Insert next non-digit literally.  Up to three digits form the
		decimal value of a single byte.  The non-digit and the three
		digits are not considered for mapping.  This works the same
		way as in Insert mode (see above, |i_CTRL-V|).
		Note: Under Windows CTRL-V is often mapped to paste text.
		Use CTRL-Q instead then.
							*c_CTRL-Q*
CTRL-Q		Same as CTRL-V.  But with some terminals it is used for
		control flow, it doesn't work then.

							*c_<Left>* *c_Left*
<Left>		cursor left
							*c_<Right>* *c_Right*
<Right>		cursor right
							*c_<S-Left>*
<S-Left> or <C-Left>					*c_<C-Left>*
		cursor one WORD left
							*c_<S-Right>*
<S-Right> or <C-Right>					*c_<C-Right>*
		cursor one WORD right
CTRL-B or <Home>				*c_CTRL-B* *c_<Home>* *c_Home*
		cursor to beginning of command-line
CTRL-E or <End>					*c_CTRL-E* *c_<End>* *c_End*
		cursor to end of command-line

							*c_<LeftMouse>*
<LeftMouse>	Move the cursor to the position of the mouse click.

CTRL-H						*c_<BS>* *c_CTRL-H* *c_BS*
<BS>		Delete the character in front of the cursor (see |:fixdel| if
		your <BS> key does not do what you want).
							*c_<Del>* *c_Del*
<Del>		Delete the character under the cursor (at end of line:
		character before the cursor) (see |:fixdel| if your <Del>
		key does not do what you want).
							*c_CTRL-W*
CTRL-W		Delete the |word| before the cursor.  This depends on the
		'iskeyword' option.
							*c_CTRL-U*
CTRL-U		Remove all characters between the cursor position and
		the beginning of the line.  Previous versions of vim
		deleted all characters on the line.  If that is the
		preferred behavior, add the following to your .vimrc: >
			:cnoremap <C-U> <C-E><C-U>
<
						*c_<Insert>* *c_Insert*
<Insert>	Toggle between insert and overstrike.  {not in Vi}

{char1} <BS> {char2}	or				*c_digraph*
CTRL-K {char1} {char2}					*c_CTRL-K*
		enter digraph (see |digraphs|).  When {char1} is a special
		key, the code for that key is inserted in <> form.  {not in Vi}

CTRL-R {0-9a-z"%#:-=.}					*c_CTRL-R* *c_<C-R>*
		Insert the contents of a numbered or named register.  Between
		typing CTRL-R and the second character '"' will be displayed
		to indicate that you are expected to enter the name of a
		register.
		The text is inserted as if you typed it, but mappings and
		abbreviations are not used.  Command-line completion through
		'wildchar' is not triggered though.  And characters that end
		the command line are inserted literally (<Esc>, <CR>, <NL>,
		<C-C>).  A <BS> or CTRL-W could still end the command line
		though, and remaining characters will then be interpreted in
		another mode, which might not be what you intended.
		Special registers:
			'"'	the unnamed register, containing the text of
				the last delete or yank
			'%'	the current file name
			'#'	the alternate file name
			'*'	the clipboard contents (X11: primary selection)
			'+'	the clipboard contents
			'/'	the last search pattern
			':'	the last command-line
			'-'	the last small (less than a line) delete
			'.'	the last inserted text
							*c_CTRL-R_=*
			'='	the expression register: you are prompted to
				enter an expression (see |expression|)
				(doesn't work at the expression prompt; some
				things such as changing the buffer or current
				window are not allowed to avoid side effects)
				When the result is a |List| the items are used
				as lines.  They can have line breaks inside
				too.
				When the result is a Float it's automatically
				converted to a String.
		See |registers| about registers.  {not in Vi}
		Implementation detail: When using the |expression| register
		and invoking setcmdpos(), this sets the position before
		inserting the resulting string.  Use CTRL-R CTRL-R to set the
		position afterwards.

CTRL-R CTRL-F				*c_CTRL-R_CTRL-F* *c_<C-R>_<C-F>*
CTRL-R CTRL-P				*c_CTRL-R_CTRL-P* *c_<C-R>_<C-P>*
CTRL-R CTRL-W				*c_CTRL-R_CTRL-W* *c_<C-R>_<C-W>*
CTRL-R CTRL-A				*c_CTRL-R_CTRL-A* *c_<C-R>_<C-A>*
		Insert the object under the cursor:
			CTRL-F	the Filename under the cursor
			CTRL-P	the Filename under the cursor, expanded with
				'path' as in |gf|
			CTRL-W	the Word under the cursor
			CTRL-A	the WORD under the cursor; see |WORD|

		When 'incsearch' is set the cursor position at the end of the
		currently displayed match is used.  With CTRL-W the part of
		the word that was already typed is not inserted again.

		{not in Vi}
		CTRL-F and CTRL-P: {only when |+file_in_path| feature is
		included}

					*c_CTRL-R_CTRL-R* *c_<C-R>_<C-R>*
					*c_CTRL-R_CTRL-O* *c_<C-R>_<C-O>*
CTRL-R CTRL-R {0-9a-z"%#:-=. CTRL-F CTRL-P CTRL-W CTRL-A}
CTRL-R CTRL-O {0-9a-z"%#:-=. CTRL-F CTRL-P CTRL-W CTRL-A}
		Insert register or object under the cursor.  Works like
		|c_CTRL-R| but inserts the text literally.  For example, if
		register a contains "xy^Hz" (where ^H is a backspace),
		"CTRL-R a" will insert "xz" while "CTRL-R CTRL-R a" will
		insert "xy^Hz".

CTRL-\ e {expr}						*c_CTRL-\_e*
		Evaluate {expr} and replace the whole command line with the
		result.  You will be prompted for the expression, type <Enter>
		to finish it.  It's most useful in mappings though.  See
		|expression|.
		See |c_CTRL-R_=| for inserting the result of an expression.
		Useful functions are |getcmdtype()|, |getcmdline()| and
		|getcmdpos()|.
		The cursor position is unchanged, except when the cursor was
		at the end of the line, then it stays at the end.
		|setcmdpos()| can be used to set the cursor position.
		The |sandbox| is used for evaluating the expression to avoid
		nasty side effects.
		Example: >
			:cmap <F7> <C-\>eAppendSome()<CR>
			:func AppendSome()
			   :let cmd = getcmdline() . " Some()"
			   :" place the cursor on the )
			   :call setcmdpos(strlen(cmd))
			   :return cmd
			:endfunc
<		This doesn't work recursively, thus not when already editing
		an expression.  But it is possible to use in a mapping.

							*c_CTRL-Y*
CTRL-Y		When there is a modeless selection, copy the selection into
		the clipboard. |modeless-selection|
		If there is no selection CTRL-Y is inserted as a character.

CTRL-J					*c_CTRL-J* *c_<NL>* *c_<CR>* *c_CR*
<CR> or <NL>	start entered command
							*c_<Esc>* *c_Esc*
<Esc>		When typed and 'x' not present in 'cpoptions', quit
		Command-line mode without executing.  In macros or when 'x'
		present in 'cpoptions', start entered command.
		Note: If your <Esc> key is hard to hit on your keyboard, train
		yourself to use CTRL-[.
							*c_CTRL-C*
CTRL-C		quit command-line without executing

							*c_<Up>* *c_Up*
<Up>		recall older command-line from history, whose beginning
		matches the current command-line (see below).
		{not available when compiled without the |+cmdline_hist|
		feature}
							*c_<Down>* *c_Down*
<Down>		recall more recent command-line from history, whose beginning
		matches the current command-line (see below).
		{not available when compiled without the |+cmdline_hist|
		feature}

							*c_<S-Up>* *c_<PageUp>*
<S-Up> or <PageUp>
		recall older command-line from history
		{not available when compiled without the |+cmdline_hist|
		feature}
						*c_<S-Down>* *c_<PageDown>*
<S-Down> or <PageDown>
		recall more recent command-line from history
		{not available when compiled without the |+cmdline_hist|
		feature}

CTRL-D		command-line completion (see |cmdline-completion|)
'wildchar' option
		command-line completion (see |cmdline-completion|)
CTRL-N		command-line completion (see |cmdline-completion|)
CTRL-P		command-line completion (see |cmdline-completion|)
CTRL-A		command-line completion (see |cmdline-completion|)
CTRL-L		command-line completion (see |cmdline-completion|)

							*c_CTRL-_*
CTRL-_		a - switch between Hebrew and English keyboard mode, which is
		private to the command-line and not related to hkmap.
		This is useful when Hebrew text entry is required in the
		command-line, searches, abbreviations, etc.  Applies only if
		Vim is compiled with the |+rightleft| feature and the
		'allowrevins' option is set.
		See |rileft.txt|.

		b - switch between Farsi and English keyboard mode, which is
		private to the command-line and not related to fkmap.  In
		Farsi keyboard mode the characters are inserted in reverse
		insert manner.  This is useful when Farsi text entry is
		required in the command-line, searches, abbreviations, etc.
		Applies only if Vim is compiled with the |+farsi| feature.
		See |farsi.txt|.

							*c_CTRL-^*
CTRL-^		Toggle the use of language |:lmap| mappings and/or Input
		Method.
		When typing a pattern for a search command and 'imsearch' is
		not -1, VAL is the value of 'imsearch', otherwise VAL is the
		value of 'iminsert'.
		When language mappings are defined:
		- If VAL is 1 (langmap mappings used) it becomes 0 (no langmap
		  mappings used).
		- If VAL was not 1 it becomes 1, thus langmap mappings are
		  enabled.
		When no language mappings are defined:
		- If VAL is 2 (Input Method is used) it becomes 0 (no input
		  method used)
		- If VAL has another value it becomes 2, thus the Input Method
		  is enabled.
		These language mappings are normally used to type characters
		that are different from what the keyboard produces.  The
		'keymap' option can be used to install a whole number of them.
		When entering a command line, langmap mappings are switched
		off, since you are expected to type a command.  After
		switching it on with CTRL-^, the new state is not used again
		for the next command or Search pattern.
		{not in Vi}

						*c_CTRL-]*
CTRL-]		Trigger abbreviation, without inserting a character.  {not in
		Vi}

For Emacs-style editing on the command-line see |emacs-keys|.

The <Up> and <Down> keys take the current command-line as a search string.
The beginning of the next/previous command-lines are compared with this
string.  The first line that matches is the new command-line.  When typing
these two keys repeatedly, the same string is used again.  For example, this
can be used to find the previous substitute command: Type ":s" and then <Up>.
The same could be done by typing <S-Up> a number of times until the desired
command-line is shown.  (Note: the shifted arrow keys do not work on all
terminals)

							*:his* *:history*
:his[tory]	Print the history of last entered commands.
		{not in Vi}
		{not available when compiled without the |+cmdline_hist|
		feature}

:his[tory] [{name}] [{first}][, [{last}]]
		List the contents of history {name} which can be:
		c[md]	 or :		command-line history
		s[earch] or / or ?	search string history
		e[xpr]	 or =		expression register history
		i[nput]	 or @		input line history
		d[ebug]	 or >		debug command history
		a[ll]			all of the above
		{not in Vi}

		If the numbers {first} and/or {last} are given, the respective
		range of entries from a history is listed.  These numbers can
		be specified in the following form:
							*:history-indexing*
		A positive number represents the absolute index of an entry
		as it is given in the first column of a :history listing.
		This number remains fixed even if other entries are deleted.

		A negative number means the relative position of an entry,
		counted from the newest entry (which has index -1) backwards.

		Examples:
		List entries 6 to 12 from the search history: >
			:history / 6,12
<
		List the recent five entries from all histories: >
			:history all -5,

:keepp[atterns] {command}			*:keepp* *:keeppatterns*
		Execute {command}, without adding anything to the search
		history

==============================================================================
2. Command-line completion				*cmdline-completion*

When editing the command-line, a few commands can be used to complete the
word before the cursor.  This is available for:

- Command names: At the start of the command-line.
- Tags: Only after the ":tag" command.
- File names: Only after a command that accepts a file name or a setting for
  an option that can be set to a file name.  This is called file name
  completion.
- Shell command names: After ":!cmd", ":r !cmd" and ":w !cmd".  $PATH is used.
- Options: Only after the ":set" command.
- Mappings: Only after a ":map" or similar command.
- Variable and function names: Only after a ":if", ":call" or similar command.

When Vim was compiled without the |+cmdline_compl| feature only file names,
directories and help items can be completed.  The number of help item matches
is limited (currently to 300) to avoid a long delay when there are very many
matches.

These are the commands that can be used:

							*c_CTRL-D*
CTRL-D		List names that match the pattern in front of the cursor.
		When showing file names, directories are highlighted (see
		'highlight' option).  Names where 'suffixes' matches are moved
		to the end.
		The 'wildoptions' option can be set to "tagfile" to list the
		file of matching tags.
					*c_CTRL-I* *c_wildchar* *c_<Tab>*
'wildchar' option
		A match is done on the pattern in front of the cursor.  The
		match (if there are several, the first match) is inserted
		in place of the pattern.  (Note: does not work inside a
		macro, because <Tab> or <Esc> are mostly used as 'wildchar',
		and these have a special meaning in some macros.) When typed
		again and there were multiple matches, the next
		match is inserted.  After the last match, the first is used
		again (wrap around).
		The behavior can be changed with the 'wildmode' option.
							*c_CTRL-N*
CTRL-N		After using 'wildchar' which got multiple matches, go to next
		match.  Otherwise recall more recent command-line from history.
<S-Tab>							*c_CTRL-P* *c_<S-Tab>*
CTRL-P		After using 'wildchar' which got multiple matches, go to
		previous match.  Otherwise recall older command-line from
		history.  <S-Tab> only works with the GUI, on the Amiga and
		with MS-DOS.
							*c_CTRL-A*
CTRL-A		All names that match the pattern in front of the cursor are
		inserted.
							*c_CTRL-L*
CTRL-L		A match is done on the pattern in front of the cursor.  If
		there is one match, it is inserted in place of the pattern.
		If there are multiple matches the longest common part is
		inserted in place of the pattern.  If the result is shorter
		than the pattern, no completion is done.
		When 'incsearch' is set, entering a search pattern for "/" or
		"?" and the current match is displayed then CTRL-L will add
		one character from the end of the current match.  If
		'ignorecase' and 'smartcase' are set and the command line has
		no uppercase characters, the added character is converted to
		lowercase.

The 'wildchar' option defaults to <Tab> (CTRL-E when in Vi compatible mode; in
a previous version <Esc> was used).  In the pattern standard wildcards '*' and
'?' are accepted when matching file names.  '*' matches any string, '?'
matches exactly one character.

The 'wildignorecase' option can be set to ignore case in filenames.

If you like tcsh's autolist completion, you can use this mapping:
	:cnoremap X <C-L><C-D>
(Where X is the command key to use, <C-L> is CTRL-L and <C-D> is CTRL-D)
This will find the longest match and then list all matching files.

If you like tcsh's autolist completion, you can use the 'wildmode' option to
emulate it.  For example, this mimics autolist=ambiguous:
	:set wildmode=longest,list
This will find the longest match with the first 'wildchar', then list all
matching files with the next.

							*suffixes*
For file name completion you can use the 'suffixes' option to set a priority
between files with almost the same name.  If there are multiple matches,
those files with an extension that is in the 'suffixes' option are ignored.
The default is ".bak,~,.o,.h,.info,.swp,.obj", which means that files ending
in ".bak", "~", ".o", ".h", ".info", ".swp" and ".obj" are sometimes ignored.

An empty entry, two consecutive commas, match a file name that does not
contain a ".", thus has no suffix.  This is useful to ignore "prog" and prefer
"prog.c".

Examples:

  pattern:	files:				match:	~
   test*	test.c test.h test.o		test.c
   test*	test.h test.o			test.h and test.o
   test*	test.i test.h test.c		test.i and test.c

It is impossible to ignore suffixes with two dots.

If there is more than one matching file (after ignoring the ones matching
the 'suffixes' option) the first file name is inserted.  You can see that
there is only one match when you type 'wildchar' twice and the completed
match stays the same.  You can get to the other matches by entering
'wildchar', CTRL-N or CTRL-P.  All files are included, also the ones with
extensions matching the 'suffixes' option.

To completely ignore files with some extension use 'wildignore'.

To match only files that end at the end of the typed text append a "$".  For
example, to match only files that end in ".c": >
	:e *.c$
This will not match a file ending in ".cpp".  Without the "$" it does match.

The old value of an option can be obtained by hitting 'wildchar' just after
the '='.  For example, typing 'wildchar' after ":set dir=" will insert the
current value of 'dir'.  This overrules file name completion for the options
that take a file name.

If you would like using <S-Tab> for CTRL-P in an xterm, put this command in
your .cshrc: >
	xmodmap -e "keysym Tab = Tab Find"
And this in your .vimrc: >
	:cmap <Esc>[1~ <C-P>

==============================================================================
3. Ex command-lines					*cmdline-lines*

The Ex commands have a few specialties:

							*:quote* *:comment*
'"' at the start of a line causes the whole line to be ignored.  '"'
after a command causes the rest of the line to be ignored.  This can be used
to add comments.  Example: >
	:set ai		"set 'autoindent' option
It is not possible to add a comment to a shell command ":!cmd" or to the
":map" command and a few others, because they see the '"' as part of their
argument.  This is mentioned where the command is explained.

							*:bar* *:\bar*
'|' can be used to separate commands, so you can give multiple commands in one
line.  If you want to use '|' in an argument, precede it with '\'.

These commands see the '|' as their argument, and can therefore not be
followed by another Vim command:
    :argdo
    :autocmd
    :bufdo
    :command
    :cscope
    :debug
    :folddoopen
    :folddoclosed
    :function
    :global
    :help
    :helpfind
    :lcscope
    :make
    :normal
    :perl
    :perldo
    :promptfind
    :promptrepl
    :pyfile
    :python
    :registers
    :read !
    :scscope
    :sign
    :tcl
    :tcldo
    :tclfile
    :vglobal
    :windo
    :write !
    :[range]!
    a user defined command without the "-bar" argument |:command|

Note that this is confusing (inherited from Vi): With ":g" the '|' is included
in the command, with ":s" it is not.

To be able to use another command anyway, use the ":execute" command.
Example (append the output of "ls" and jump to the first line): >
	:execute 'r !ls' | '[

There is one exception: When the 'b' flag is present in 'cpoptions', with the
":map" and ":abbr" commands and friends CTRL-V needs to be used instead of
'\'.  You can also use "<Bar>" instead.  See also |map_bar|.

Examples: >
	:!ls | wc		view the output of two commands
	:r !ls | wc		insert the same output in the text
	:%g/foo/p|>		moves all matching lines one shiftwidth
	:%s/foo/bar/|>		moves one line one shiftwidth
	:map q 10^V|		map "q" to "10|"
	:map q 10\| map \ l	map "q" to "10\" and map "\" to "l"
					(when 'b' is present in 'cpoptions')

You can also use <NL> to separate commands in the same way as with '|'.  To
insert a <NL> use CTRL-V CTRL-J.  "^@" will be shown.  Using '|' is the
preferred method.  But for external commands a <NL> must be used, because a
'|' is included in the external command.  To avoid the special meaning of <NL>
it must be preceded with a backslash.  Example: >
	:r !date<NL>-join
This reads the current date into the file and joins it with the previous line.

Note that when the command before the '|' generates an error, the following
commands will not be executed.


Because of Vi compatibility the following strange commands are supported: >
	:|			print current line (like ":p")
	:3|			print line 3 (like ":3p")
	:3			goto line 3

A colon is allowed between the range and the command name.  It is ignored
(this is Vi compatible).  For example: >
	:1,$:s/pat/string

When the character '%' or '#' is used where a file name is expected, they are
expanded to the current and alternate file name (see the chapter "editing
files" |:_%| |:_#|).

Embedded spaces in file names are allowed on the Amiga if one file name is
expected as argument.  Trailing spaces will be ignored, unless escaped with a
backslash or CTRL-V.  Note that the ":next" command uses spaces to separate
file names.  Escape the spaces to include them in a file name.  Example: >
	:next foo\ bar goes\ to school\
starts editing the three files "foo bar", "goes to" and "school ".

When you want to use the special characters '"' or '|' in a command, or want
to use '%' or '#' in a file name, precede them with a backslash.  The
backslash is not required in a range and in the ":substitute" command.

							*:_!*
The '!' (bang) character after an Ex command makes the command behave in a
different way.  The '!' should be placed immediately after the command, without
any blanks in between.  If you insert blanks the '!' will be seen as an
argument for the command, which has a different meaning.  For example:
	:w! name	write the current buffer to file "name", overwriting
			any existing file
	:w !name	send the current buffer as standard input to command
			"name"

==============================================================================
4. Ex command-line ranges	*cmdline-ranges* *[range]* *E16*

Some Ex commands accept a line range in front of them.  This is noted as
[range].  It consists of one or more line specifiers, separated with ',' or
';'.

The basics are explained in section |10.3| of the user manual.

						*:,* *:;*
When separated with ';' the cursor position will be set to that line
before interpreting the next line specifier.  This doesn't happen for ','.
Examples: >
   4,/this line/
<	from line 4 till match with "this line" after the cursor line. >
   5;/that line/
<	from line 5 till match with "that line" after line 5.

The default line specifier for most commands is the cursor position, but the
commands ":write" and ":global" have the whole file (1,$) as default.

If more line specifiers are given than required for the command, the first
one(s) will be ignored.

Line numbers may be specified with:		*:range* *E14* *{address}*
	{number}	an absolute line number
	.		the current line			  *:.*
	$		the last line in the file		  *:$*
	%		equal to 1,$ (the entire file)		  *:%*
	't		position of mark t (lowercase)		  *:'*
	'T		position of mark T (uppercase); when the mark is in
			another file it cannot be used in a range
	/{pattern}[/]	the next line where {pattern} matches	  *:/*
	?{pattern}[?]	the previous line where {pattern} matches *:?*
	\/		the next line where the previously used search
			pattern matches
	\?		the previous line where the previously used search
			pattern matches
	\&		the next line where the previously used substitute
			pattern matches

Each may be followed (several times) by '+' or '-' and an optional number.
This number is added or subtracted from the preceding line number.  If the
number is omitted, 1 is used.

The "/" and "?" after {pattern} are required to separate the pattern from
anything that follows.

The "/" and "?" may be preceded with another address.  The search starts from
there.  The difference from using ';' is that the cursor isn't moved.
Examples: >
	/pat1//pat2/	Find line containing "pat2" after line containing
			"pat1", without moving the cursor.
	7;/pat2/	Find line containing "pat2", after line 7, leaving
			the cursor in line 7.

The {number} must be between 0 and the number of lines in the file.  When
using a 0 (zero) this is interpreted as a 1 by most commands.  Commands that
use it as a count do use it as a zero (|:tag|, |:pop|, etc).  Some commands
interpret the zero as "before the first line" (|:read|, search pattern, etc).

Examples: >
	.+3		three lines below the cursor
	/that/+1	the line below the next line containing "that"
	.,$		from current line until end of file
	0;/that		the first line containing "that", also matches in the
			first line.
	1;/that		the first line after line 1 containing "that"

Some commands allow for a count after the command.  This count is used as the
number of lines to be used, starting with the line given in the last line
specifier (the default is the cursor line).  The commands that accept a count
are the ones that use a range but do not have a file name argument (because
a file name can also be a number).

Examples: >
	:s/x/X/g 5	substitute 'x' by 'X' in the current line and four
			following lines
	:23d 4		delete lines 23, 24, 25 and 26


Folds and Range

When folds are active the line numbers are rounded off to include the whole
closed fold.  See |fold-behavior|.


Reverse Range						*E493*

A range should have the lower line number first.  If this is not the case, Vim
will ask you if it should swap the line numbers.
	Backwards range given, OK to swap ~
This is not done within the global command ":g".

You can use ":silent" before a command to avoid the question, the range will
always be swapped then.


Count and Range						*N:*

When giving a count before entering ":", this is translated into:
		:.,.+(count - 1)
In words: The 'count' lines at and after the cursor.  Example: To delete
three lines: >
		3:d<CR>		is translated into: .,.+2d<CR>
<

Visual Mode and Range					*v_:*

{Visual}:	Starts a command-line with the Visual selected lines as a
		range.  The code `:'<,'>` is used for this range, which makes
		it possible to select a similar line from the command-line
		history for repeating a command on different Visually selected
		lines.
		When Visual mode was already ended, a short way to use the
		Visual area for a range is `:*`.  This requires that "*" does
		not appear in 'cpo', see |cpo-star|.  Otherwise you will have
		to type `:'<,'>`


==============================================================================
5. Ex command-line flags				*ex-flags*

These flags are supported by a selection of Ex commands.  They print the line
that the cursor ends up after executing the command:

	l	output like for |:list|
	#	add line number
	p	output like for |:print|

The flags can be combined, thus "l#" uses both a line number and |:list| style
output.

==============================================================================
6. Ex special characters				*cmdline-special*

Note: These are special characters in the executed command line.  If you want
to insert special things while typing you can use the CTRL-R command.  For
example, "%" stands for the current file name, while CTRL-R % inserts the
current file name right away.  See |c_CTRL-R|.

Note: If you want to avoid the special characters in a Vim script you may want
to use |fnameescape()|.


In Ex commands, at places where a file name can be used, the following
characters have a special meaning.  These can also be used in the expression
function expand() |expand()|.
	%	Is replaced with the current file name.		  *:_%* *c_%*
	#	Is replaced with the alternate file name.	  *:_#* *c_#*
		This is remembered for every window.
	#n	(where n is a number) is replaced with		  *:_#0* *:_#n*
		the file name of buffer n.  "#0" is the same as "#".     *c_#n*
	##	Is replaced with all names in the argument list	  *:_##* *c_##*
		concatenated, separated by spaces.  Each space in a name
		is preceded with a backslash.
	#<n	(where n is a number > 0) is replaced with old	  *:_#<* *c_#<*
		file name n.  See |:oldfiles| or |v:oldfiles| to get the
		number.							*E809*
		{only when compiled with the |+eval| and |+viminfo| features}

Note that these, except "#<n", give the file name as it was typed.  If an
absolute path is needed (when using the file name from a different directory),
you need to add ":p".  See |filename-modifiers|.

The "#<n" item returns an absolute path, but it will start with "~/" for files
below your home directory.

Note that backslashes are inserted before spaces, so that the command will
correctly interpret the file name.  But this doesn't happen for shell
commands.  For those you probably have to use quotes (this fails for files
that contain a quote and wildcards): >
	:!ls "%"
	:r !spell "%"

To avoid the special meaning of '%' and '#' insert a backslash before it.
Detail: The special meaning is always escaped when there is a backslash before
it, no matter how many backslashes.
	you type:		result	~
	   #			alternate.file
	   \#			#
	   \\#			\#

			       *:<cword>* *:<cWORD>* *:<cfile>* *<cfile>*
			       *:<sfile>* *<sfile>* *:<afile>* *<afile>*
			       *:<abuf>* *<abuf>* *:<amatch>* *<amatch>*
			       *<slnum>* *E495* *E496* *E497* *E499* *E500*
Note: these are typed literally, they are not special keys!
	<cword>    is replaced with the word under the cursor (like |star|)
	<cWORD>    is replaced with the WORD under the cursor (see |WORD|)
	<cfile>    is replaced with the path name under the cursor (like what
		   |gf| uses)
	<afile>    When executing autocommands, is replaced with the file name
		   for a file read or write.
	<abuf>     When executing autocommands, is replaced with the currently
		   effective buffer number (for ":r file" and ":so file" it is
		   the current buffer, the file being read/sourced is not in a
		   buffer).
	<amatch>   When executing autocommands, is replaced with the match for
		   which this autocommand was executed.  It differs from
		   <afile> only when the file name isn't used to match with
		   (for FileType, Syntax and SpellFileMissing events).
	<sfile>    When executing a ":source" command, is replaced with the
		   file name of the sourced file.  *E498* 
		   When executing a function, is replaced with
		   "function {function-name}"; function call nesting is
		   indicated like this:
		   "function {function-name1}..{function-name2}".  Note that
		   filename-modifiers are useless when <sfile> is used inside
		   a function.
	<slnum>	   When executing a ":source" command, is replaced with the
	           line number.  *E842*
		   When executing a function it's the line number relative to
		   the start of the function.

							 *filename-modifiers*
*:_%:* *::8* *::p* *::.* *::~* *::h* *::t* *::r* *::e* *::s* *::gs* *::S*
     *%:8* *%:p* *%:.* *%:~* *%:h* *%:t* *%:r* *%:e* *%:s* *%:gs* *%:S*
The file name modifiers can be used after "%", "#", "#n", "<cfile>", "<sfile>",
"<afile>" or "<abuf>".  They are also used with the |fnamemodify()| function.
These are not available when Vim has been compiled without the |+modify_fname|
feature.
These modifiers can be given, in this order:
	:p	Make file name a full path.  Must be the first modifier.  Also
		changes "~/" (and "~user/" for Unix and VMS) to the path for
		the home directory.  If the name is a directory a path
		separator is added at the end.  For a file name that does not
		exist and does not have an absolute path the result is
		unpredictable.  On MS-Windows an 8.3 filename is expanded to
		the long name.
	:8	Converts the path to 8.3 short format (currently only on
		MS-Windows).  Will act on as much of a path that is an
		existing path.
	:~	Reduce file name to be relative to the home directory, if
		possible.  File name is unmodified if it is not below the home
		directory.
	:.	Reduce file name to be relative to current directory, if
		possible.  File name is unmodified if it is not below the
		current directory.
		For maximum shortness, use ":~:.".
	:h	Head of the file name (the last component and any separators
		removed).  Cannot be used with :e, :r or :t.
		Can be repeated to remove several components at the end.
		When the file name ends in a path separator, only the path
		separator is removed.  Thus ":p:h" on a directory name results
		on the directory name itself (without trailing slash).
		When the file name is an absolute path (starts with "/" for
		Unix; "x:\" for MS-DOS, WIN32, OS/2; "drive:" for Amiga), that
		part is not removed.  When there is no head (path is relative
		to current directory) the result is empty.
	:t	Tail of the file name (last component of the name).  Must
		precede any :r or :e.
	:r	Root of the file name (the last extension removed).  When
		there is only an extension (file name that starts with '.',
		e.g., ".vimrc"), it is not removed.  Can be repeated to remove
		several extensions (last one first).
	:e	Extension of the file name.  Only makes sense when used alone.
		When there is no extension the result is empty.
		When there is only an extension (file name that starts with
		'.'), the result is empty.  Can be repeated to include more
		extensions.  If there are not enough extensions (but at least
		one) as much as possible are included.
	:s?pat?sub?
		Substitute the first occurrence of "pat" with "sub".  This
		works like the |:s| command.  "pat" is a regular expression.
		Any character can be used for '?', but it must not occur in
		"pat" or "sub".
		After this, the previous modifiers can be used again.  For
		example ":p", to make a full path after the substitution.
	:gs?pat?sub?
		Substitute all occurrences of "pat" with "sub".  Otherwise
		this works like ":s".
	:S	Escape special characters for use with a shell command (see 
		|shellescape()|). Must be the last one. Examples: >
		    :!dir <cfile>:S
		    :call system('chmod +w -- ' . expand('%:S'))

Examples, when the file name is "src/version.c", current dir
"/home/mool/vim": >
  :p			/home/mool/vim/src/version.c
  :p:.				       src/version.c
  :p:~				 ~/vim/src/version.c
  :h				       src
  :p:h			/home/mool/vim/src
  :p:h:h		/home/mool/vim
  :t					   version.c
  :p:t					   version.c
  :r				       src/version
  :p:r			/home/mool/vim/src/version
  :t:r					   version
  :e						   c
  :s?version?main?		       src/main.c
  :s?version?main?:p	/home/mool/vim/src/main.c
  :p:gs?/?\\?		\home\mool\vim\src\version.c

Examples, when the file name is "src/version.c.gz": >
  :p			/home/mool/vim/src/version.c.gz
  :e						     gz
  :e:e						   c.gz
  :e:e:e					   c.gz
  :e:e:r					   c
  :r				       src/version.c
  :r:e						   c
  :r:r				       src/version
  :r:r:r			       src/version
<
					*extension-removal* *:_%<*
If a "<" is appended to "%", "#", "#n" or "CTRL-V p" the extension of the file
name is removed (everything after and including the last '.' in the file
name).  This is included for backwards compatibility with version 3.0, the
":r" form is preferred.  Examples: >

	%		current file name
	%<		current file name without extension
	#		alternate file name for current window
	#<		idem, without extension
	#31		alternate file number 31
	#31<		idem, without extension
	<cword>		word under the cursor
	<cWORD>		WORD under the cursor (see |WORD|)
	<cfile>		path name under the cursor
	<cfile><	idem, without extension

Note: Where a file name is expected wildcards expansion is done.  On Unix the
shell is used for this, unless it can be done internally (for speed).
Backticks also work, like in >
	:n `echo *.c`
(backtick expansion is not possible in |restricted-mode|)
But expansion is only done if there are any wildcards before expanding the
'%', '#', etc..  This avoids expanding wildcards inside a file name.  If you
want to expand the result of <cfile>, add a wildcard character to it.
Examples: (alternate file name is "?readme?")
	command		expands to  ~
	:e #		:e ?readme?
	:e `ls #`	:e {files matching "?readme?"}
	:e #.*		:e {files matching "?readme?.*"}
	:cd <cfile>	:cd {file name under cursor}
	:cd <cfile>*	:cd {file name under cursor plus "*" and then expanded}

When the expanded argument contains a "!" and it is used for a shell command
(":!cmd", ":r !cmd" or ":w !cmd"), the "!" is escaped with a backslash to
avoid it being expanded into a previously used command.  When the 'shell'
option contains "sh", this is done twice, to avoid the shell trying to expand
the "!".

							*filename-backslash*
For filesystems that use a backslash as directory separator (MS-DOS, Windows,
OS/2), it's a bit difficult to recognize a backslash that is used to escape
the special meaning of the next character.  The general rule is: If the
backslash is followed by a normal file name character, it does not have a
special meaning.  Therefore "\file\foo" is a valid file name, you don't have
to type the backslash twice.

An exception is the '$' sign.  It is a valid character in a file name.  But
to avoid a file name like "$home" to be interpreted as an environment variable,
it needs to be preceded by a backslash.  Therefore you need to use "/\$home"
for the file "$home" in the root directory.  A few examples:

	FILE NAME	INTERPRETED AS	~
	$home		expanded to value of environment var $home
	\$home		file "$home" in current directory
	/\$home		file "$home" in root directory
	\\$home		file "\\", followed by expanded $home

==============================================================================
7. Command-line window				*cmdline-window* *cmdwin*
							*command-line-window*
In the command-line window the command line can be edited just like editing
text in any window.  It is a special kind of window, because you cannot leave
it in a normal way.
{not available when compiled without the |+cmdline_hist| or |+vertsplit|
feature}


OPEN						*c_CTRL-F* *q:* *q/* *q?*

There are two ways to open the command-line window:
1. From Command-line mode, use the key specified with the 'cedit' option.
   The default is CTRL-F when 'compatible' is not set.
2. From Normal mode, use the "q:", "q/" or "q?" command.
   This starts editing an Ex command-line ("q:") or search string ("q/" or
   "q?").  Note that this is not possible while recording is in progress (the
   "q" stops recording then).

When the window opens it is filled with the command-line history.  The last
line contains the command as typed so far.  The left column will show a
character that indicates the type of command-line being edited, see
|cmdwin-char|.

Vim will be in Normal mode when the editor is opened, except when 'insertmode'
is set.

The height of the window is specified with 'cmdwinheight' (or smaller if there
is no room).  The window is always full width and is positioned just above the
command-line.


EDIT

You can now use commands to move around and edit the text in the window.  Both
in Normal mode and Insert mode.

It is possible to use ":", "/" and other commands that use the command-line,
but it's not possible to open another command-line window then.  There is no
nesting.
							*E11*
The command-line window is not a normal window.  It is not possible to move to
another window or edit another buffer.  All commands that would do this are
disabled in the command-line window.  Of course it _is_ possible to execute
any command that you entered in the command-line window.  Other text edits are
discarded when closing the window.


CLOSE							*E199*

There are several ways to leave the command-line window:

<CR>		Execute the command-line under the cursor.  Works both in
		Insert and in Normal mode.
CTRL-C		Continue in Command-line mode.  The command-line under the
		cursor is used as the command-line.  Works both in Insert and
		in Normal mode.  ":close" also works.  There is no redraw,
		thus the window will remain visible.
:quit		Discard the command line and go back to Normal mode.
		":exit", ":xit" and CTRL-\ CTRL-N also work.
:qall		Quit Vim, unless there are changes in some buffer.
:qall!		Quit Vim, discarding changes to any buffer.

Once the command-line window is closed the old window sizes are restored.  The
executed command applies to the window and buffer where the command-line was
started from.  This works as if the command-line window was not there, except
that there will be an extra screen redraw.
The buffer used for the command-line window is deleted.  Any changes to lines
other than the one that is executed with <CR> are lost.

If you would like to execute the command under the cursor and then have the
command-line window open again, you may find this mapping useful: >

	:autocmd CmdwinEnter * map <buffer> <F5> <CR>q:


VARIOUS

The command-line window cannot be used:
- when there already is a command-line window (no nesting)
- for entering an encryption key or when using inputsecret()
- when Vim was not compiled with the |+vertsplit| feature

Some options are set when the command-line window is opened:
'filetype'	"vim", when editing an Ex command-line; this starts Vim syntax
		highlighting if it was enabled
'rightleft'	off
'modifiable'	on
'buftype'	"nofile"
'swapfile'	off

It is allowed to write the buffer contents to a file.  This is an easy way to
save the command-line history and read it back later.

If the 'wildchar' option is set to <Tab>, and the command-line window is used
for an Ex command, then two mappings will be added to use <Tab> for completion
in the command-line window, like this: >
	:imap <buffer> <Tab> <C-X><C-V>
	:nmap <buffer> <Tab> a<C-X><C-V>
Note that hitting <Tab> in Normal mode will do completion on the next
character.  That way it works at the end of the line.
If you don't want these mappings, disable them with: >
	au CmdwinEnter [:>] iunmap <Tab>
	au CmdwinEnter [:>] nunmap <Tab>
You could put these lines in your vimrc file.

While in the command-line window you cannot use the mouse to put the cursor in
another window, or drag statuslines of other windows.  You can drag the
statusline of the command-line window itself and the statusline above it.
Thus you can resize the command-line window, but not others.

The |getcmdwintype()| function returns the type of the command-line being
edited as described in |cmdwin-char|.


AUTOCOMMANDS

Two autocommand events are used: |CmdwinEnter| and |CmdwinLeave|.  Since this
window is of a special type, the WinEnter, WinLeave, BufEnter and BufLeave
events are not triggered.  You can use the Cmdwin events to do settings
specifically for the command-line window.  Be careful not to cause side
effects!
Example: >
	:au CmdwinEnter :  let b:cpt_save = &cpt | set cpt=.
	:au CmdwinLeave :  let &cpt = b:cpt_save
This sets 'complete' to use completion in the current window for |i_CTRL-N|.
Another example: >
	:au CmdwinEnter [/?]  startinsert
This will make Vim start in Insert mode in the command-line window.

						*cmdwin-char*
The character used for the pattern indicates the type of command-line:
	:	normal Ex command
	>	debug mode command |debug-mode|
	/	forward search string
	?	backward search string
	=	expression for "= |expr-register|
	@	string for |input()|

Terminal information					*terminal-info*

Vim uses information about the terminal you are using to fill the screen and
recognize what keys you hit.  If this information is not correct, the screen
may be messed up or keys may not be recognized.  The actions which have to be
performed on the screen are accomplished by outputting a string of
characters.  Special keys produce a string of characters.  These strings are
stored in the terminal options, see |terminal-options|.

NOTE: Most of this is not used when running the |GUI|.

1. Startup			|startup-terminal|
2. Terminal options		|terminal-options|
3. Window size			|window-size|
4. Slow and fast terminals	|slow-fast-terminal|
5. Using the mouse		|mouse-using|

==============================================================================
1. Startup						*startup-terminal*

When Vim is started a default terminal type is assumed.  For the Amiga this is
a standard CLI window, for MS-DOS the pc terminal, for Unix an ansi terminal.
A few other terminal types are always available, see below |builtin-terms|.

You can give the terminal name with the '-T' Vim argument.  If it is not given
Vim will try to get the name from the TERM environment variable.

				*termcap* *terminfo* *E557* *E558* *E559*
On Unix the terminfo database or termcap file is used.  This is referred to as
"termcap" in all the documentation.  At compile time, when running configure,
the choice whether to use terminfo or termcap is done automatically.  When
running Vim the output of ":version" will show |+terminfo| if terminfo is
used.  Also see |xterm-screens|.

On non-Unix systems a termcap is only available if Vim was compiled with
TERMCAP defined.

					*builtin-terms* *builtin_terms*
Which builtin terminals are available depends on a few defines in feature.h,
which need to be set at compile time:
    define		output of ":version"	terminals builtin	~
NO_BUILTIN_TCAPS	-builtin_terms		none
SOME_BUILTIN_TCAPS	+builtin_terms		most common ones (default)
ALL_BUILTIN_TCAPS	++builtin_terms		all available

You can see a list of available builtin terminals with ":set term=xxx" (when
not running the GUI).  Also see |+builtin_terms|.

If the termcap code is included Vim will try to get the strings for the
terminal you are using from the termcap file and the builtin termcaps.  Both
are always used, if an entry for the terminal you are using is present.  Which
one is used first depends on the 'ttybuiltin' option:

'ttybuiltin' on		1: builtin termcap	2: external termcap
'ttybuiltin' off	1: external termcap	2: builtin termcap

If an option is missing in one of them, it will be obtained from the other
one.  If an option is present in both, the one first encountered is used.

Which external termcap file is used varies from system to system and may
depend on the environment variables "TERMCAP" and "TERMPATH".  See "man
tgetent".

Settings depending on terminal			*term-dependent-settings*

If you want to set options or mappings, depending on the terminal name, you
can do this best in your .vimrc.  Example: >

   if &term == "xterm"
     ... xterm maps and settings ...
   elseif &term =~ "vt10."
     ... vt100, vt102 maps and settings ...
   endif
<
						*raw-terminal-mode*
For normal editing the terminal will be put into "raw" mode.  The strings
defined with 't_ti' and 't_ks' will be sent to the terminal.  Normally this
puts the terminal in a state where the termcap codes are valid and activates
the cursor and function keys.  When Vim exits the terminal will be put back
into the mode it was before Vim started.  The strings defined with 't_te' and
't_ke' will be sent to the terminal.  On the Amiga, with commands that execute
an external command (e.g., "!!"), the terminal will be put into Normal mode
for a moment.  This means that you can stop the output to the screen by
hitting a printing key.  Output resumes when you hit <BS>.

							*cs7-problem*
Note: If the terminal settings are changed after running Vim, you might have
an illegal combination of settings.  This has been reported on Solaris 2.5
with "stty cs8 parenb", which is restored as "stty cs7 parenb".  Use
"stty cs8 -parenb -istrip" instead, this is restored correctly.

Some termcap entries are wrong in the sense that after sending 't_ks' the
cursor keys send codes different from the codes defined in the termcap.  To
avoid this you can set 't_ks' (and 't_ke') to empty strings.  This must be
done during initialization (see |initialization|), otherwise it's too late.

Some termcap entries assume that the highest bit is always reset.  For
example: The cursor-up entry for the Amiga could be ":ku=\E[A:".  But the
Amiga really sends "\233A".  This works fine if the highest bit is reset,
e.g., when using an Amiga over a serial line.  If the cursor keys don't work,
try the entry ":ku=\233A:".

Some termcap entries have the entry ":ku=\E[A:".  But the Amiga really sends
"\233A".  On output "\E[" and "\233" are often equivalent, on input they
aren't.  You will have to change the termcap entry, or change the key code with
the :set command to fix this.

Many cursor key codes start with an <Esc>.  Vim must find out if this is a
single hit of the <Esc> key or the start of a cursor key sequence.  It waits
for a next character to arrive.  If it does not arrive within one second a
single <Esc> is assumed.  On very slow systems this may fail, causing cursor
keys not to work sometimes.  If you discover this problem reset the 'timeout'
option.  Vim will wait for the next character to arrive after an <Esc>.  If
you want to enter a single <Esc> you must type it twice.  Resetting the
'esckeys' option avoids this problem in Insert mode, but you lose the
possibility to use cursor and function keys in Insert mode.

On the Amiga the recognition of window resizing is activated only when the
terminal name is "amiga" or "builtin_amiga".

Some terminals have confusing codes for the cursor keys.  The televideo 925 is
such a terminal.  It sends a CTRL-H for cursor-left.  This would make it
impossible to distinguish a backspace and cursor-left.  To avoid this problem
CTRL-H is never recognized as cursor-left.

					*vt100-cursor-keys* *xterm-cursor-keys*
Other terminals (e.g., vt100 and xterm) have cursor keys that send <Esc>OA,
<Esc>OB, etc.  Unfortunately these are valid commands in insert mode: Stop
insert, Open a new line above the new one, start inserting 'A', 'B', etc.
Instead of performing these commands Vim will erroneously recognize this typed
key sequence as a cursor key movement.  To avoid this and make Vim do what you
want in either case you could use these settings: >
	:set notimeout		" don't timeout on mappings
	:set ttimeout		" do timeout on terminal key codes
	:set timeoutlen=100	" timeout after 100 msec
This requires the key-codes to be sent within 100 msec in order to recognize
them as a cursor key.  When you type you normally are not that fast, so they
are recognized as individual typed commands, even though Vim receives the same
sequence of bytes.

				*vt100-function-keys* *xterm-function-keys*
An xterm can send function keys F1 to F4 in two modes: vt100 compatible or
not.  Because Vim may not know what the xterm is sending, both types of keys
are recognized.  The same happens for the <Home> and <End> keys.
			normal			vt100 ~
	<F1>	t_k1	<Esc>[11~	<xF1>	<Esc>OP	    *<xF1>-xterm*
	<F2>	t_k2	<Esc>[12~	<xF2>	<Esc>OQ	    *<xF2>-xterm*
	<F3>	t_k3	<Esc>[13~	<xF3>	<Esc>OR	    *<xF3>-xterm*
	<F4>	t_k4	<Esc>[14~	<xF4>	<Esc>OS	    *<xF4>-xterm*
	<Home>	t_kh	<Esc>[7~	<xHome>	<Esc>OH	    *<xHome>-xterm*
	<End>	t_@7	<Esc>[4~	<xEnd>	<Esc>OF	    *<xEnd>-xterm*

When Vim starts, <xF1> is mapped to <F1>, <xF2> to <F2> etc.  This means that
by default both codes do the same thing.  If you make a mapping for <xF2>,
because your terminal does have two keys, the default mapping is overwritten,
thus you can use the <F2> and <xF2> keys for something different.

							*xterm-shifted-keys*
Newer versions of xterm support shifted function keys and special keys.  Vim
recognizes most of them.  Use ":set termcap" to check which are supported and
what the codes are.  Mostly these are not in a termcap, they are only
supported by the builtin_xterm termcap.

							*xterm-modifier-keys*
Newer versions of xterm support Alt and Ctrl for most function keys.  To avoid
having to add all combinations of Alt, Ctrl and Shift for every key a special
sequence is recognized at the end of a termcap entry: ";*X".  The "X" can be
any character, often '~' is used.  The ";*" stands for an optional modifier
argument.  ";2" is Shift, ";3" is Alt, ";5" is Ctrl and ";9" is Meta (when
it's different from Alt).  They can be combined.  Examples: >
	:set <F8>=^[[19;*~
	:set <Home>=^[[1;*H
Another speciality about these codes is that they are not overwritten by
another code.  That is to avoid that the codes obtained from xterm directly
|t_RV| overwrite them.
							*xterm-scroll-region*
The default termcap entry for xterm on Sun and other platforms does not
contain the entry for scroll regions.  Add ":cs=\E[%i%d;%dr:" to the xterm
entry in /etc/termcap and everything should work.

							*xterm-end-home-keys*
On some systems (at least on FreeBSD with XFree86 3.1.2) the codes that the
<End> and <Home> keys send contain a <Nul> character.  To make these keys send
the proper key code, add these lines to your ~/.Xdefaults file:

*VT100.Translations:		#override \n\
		<Key>Home: string("0x1b") string("[7~") \n\
		<Key>End: string("0x1b") string("[8~")

						*xterm-8bit* *xterm-8-bit*
Xterm can be run in a mode where it uses 8-bit escape sequences.  The CSI code
is used instead of <Esc>[.  The advantage is that an <Esc> can quickly be
recognized in Insert mode, because it can't be confused with the start of a
special key.
For the builtin termcap entries, Vim checks if the 'term' option contains
"8bit" anywhere.  It then uses 8-bit characters for the termcap entries, the
mouse and a few other things.  You would normally set $TERM in your shell to
"xterm-8bit" and Vim picks this up and adjusts to the 8-bit setting
automatically.
When Vim receives a response to the |t_RV| (request version) sequence and it
starts with CSI, it assumes that the terminal is in 8-bit mode and will
convert all key sequences to their 8-bit variants.

==============================================================================
2. Terminal options		*terminal-options* *termcap-options* *E436*

The terminal options can be set just like normal options.  But they are not
shown with the ":set all" command.  Instead use ":set termcap".

It is always possible to change individual strings by setting the
appropriate option.  For example: >
	:set t_ce=^V^[[K	(CTRL-V, <Esc>, [, K)

{Vi: no terminal options.  You have to exit Vi, edit the termcap entry and
try again}

The options are listed below.  The associated termcap code is always equal to
the last two characters of the option name.  Only one termcap code is
required: Cursor motion, 't_cm'.

The options 't_da', 't_db', 't_ms', 't_xs' represent flags in the termcap.
When the termcap flag is present, the option will be set to "y".  But any
non-empty string means that the flag is set.  An empty string means that the
flag is not set.  't_CS' works like this too, but it isn't a termcap flag.

Note about t_so and t_mr: When the termcap entry "so" is not present the
entry for "mr" is used.  And vice versa.  The same is done for "se" and "me".
If your terminal supports both inversion and standout mode, you can see two
different modes.  If your terminal supports only one of the modes, both will
look the same.

							*keypad-comma*
The keypad keys, when they are not mapped, behave like the equivalent normal
key.  There is one exception: if you have a comma on the keypad instead of a
decimal point, Vim will use a dot anyway.  Use these mappings to fix that: >
	:noremap <kPoint> ,
	:noremap! <kPoint> ,
<							*xterm-codes*
There is a special trick to obtain the key codes which currently only works
for xterm.  When |t_RV| is defined and a response is received which indicates
an xterm with patchlevel 141 or higher, Vim uses special escape sequences to
request the key codes directly from the xterm.  The responses are used to
adjust the various t_ codes.  This avoids the problem that the xterm can
produce different codes, depending on the mode it is in (8-bit, VT102,
VT220, etc.).  The result is that codes like <xF1> are no longer needed.
Note: This is only done on startup.  If the xterm options are changed after
Vim has started, the escape sequences may not be recognized any more.

							*xterm-resize*
Window resizing with xterm only works if the allowWindowOps resource is
enabled.  On some systems and versions of xterm it's disabled by default
because someone thought it would be a security issue.  It's not clear if this
is actually the case.

To overrule the default, put this line in your ~/.Xdefaults or
~/.Xresources:
>
	XTerm*allowWindowOps: 		true

And run "xrdb -merge .Xresources" to make it effective.  You can check the
value with the context menu (right mouse button while CTRL key is pressed),
there should be a tick at allow-window-ops.

							*termcap-colors*
Note about colors: The 't_Co' option tells Vim the number of colors available.
When it is non-zero, the 't_AB' and 't_AF' options are used to set the color.
If one of these is not available, 't_Sb' and 't_Sf' are used.  't_me' is used
to reset to the default colors.

				*termcap-cursor-shape* *termcap-cursor-color*
When Vim enters Insert mode the 't_SI' escape sequence is sent.  When leaving
Insert mode 't_EI' is used.  But only if both are defined.  This can be used
to change the shape or color of the cursor in Insert mode.  These are not
standard termcap/terminfo entries, you need to set them yourself.
Example for an xterm, this changes the color of the cursor: >
    if &term =~ "xterm"
	let &t_SI = "\<Esc>]12;purple\x7"
	let &t_EI = "\<Esc>]12;blue\x7"
    endif
NOTE: When Vim exits the shape for Normal mode will remain.  The shape from
before Vim started will not be restored.
{not available when compiled without the |+cursorshape| feature}

							*termcap-title*
The 't_ts' and 't_fs' options are used to set the window title if the terminal
allows title setting via sending strings.  They are sent before and after the
title string, respectively.  Similar 't_IS' and 't_IE'  are used to set the
icon text.  These are Vim-internal extensions of the Unix termcap, so they
cannot be obtained from an external termcap.  However, the builtin termcap
contains suitable entries for xterm and iris-ansi, so you don't need to set
them here.
							*hpterm*
If inversion or other highlighting does not work correctly, try setting the
't_xs' option to a non-empty string.  This makes the 't_ce' code be used to
remove highlighting from a line.  This is required for "hpterm".  Setting the
'weirdinvert' option has the same effect as making 't_xs' non-empty, and vice
versa.

							*scroll-region*
Some termcaps do not include an entry for 'cs' (scroll region), although the
terminal does support it.  For example: xterm on a Sun.  You can use the
builtin_xterm or define t_cs yourself.  For example: >
	:set t_cs=^V^[[%i%d;%dr
Where ^V is CTRL-V and ^[ is <Esc>.

The vertical scroll region t_CV is not a standard termcap code.  Vim uses it
internally in the GUI.  But it can also be defined for a terminal, if you can
find one that supports it.  The two arguments are the left and right column of
the region which to restrict the scrolling to.  Just like t_cs defines the top
and bottom lines.  Defining t_CV will make scrolling in vertically split
windows a lot faster.  Don't set t_CV when t_da or t_db is set (text isn't
cleared when scrolling).

Unfortunately it is not possible to deduce from the termcap how cursor
positioning should be done when using a scrolling region: Relative to the
beginning of the screen or relative to the beginning of the scrolling region.
Most terminals use the first method.  A known exception is the MS-DOS console
(pcterm).  The 't_CS' option should be set to any string when cursor
positioning is relative to the start of the scrolling region.  It should be
set to an empty string otherwise.  It defaults to "yes" when 'term' is
"pcterm".

Note for xterm users: The shifted cursor keys normally don't work.  You can
	make them work with the xmodmap command and some mappings in Vim.

	Give these commands in the xterm:
		xmodmap -e "keysym Up = Up F13"
		xmodmap -e "keysym Down = Down F16"
		xmodmap -e "keysym Left = Left F18"
		xmodmap -e "keysym Right = Right F19"

	And use these mappings in Vim:
		:map <t_F3> <S-Up>
		:map! <t_F3> <S-Up>
		:map <t_F6> <S-Down>
		:map! <t_F6> <S-Down>
		:map <t_F8> <S-Left>
		:map! <t_F8> <S-Left>
		:map <t_F9> <S-Right>
		:map! <t_F9> <S-Right>

Instead of, say, <S-Up> you can use any other command that you want to use the
shift-cursor-up key for.  (Note: To help people that have a Sun keyboard with
left side keys F14 is not used because it is confused with the undo key; F15
is not used, because it does a window-to-front; F17 is not used, because it
closes the window.  On other systems you can probably use them.)

==============================================================================
3. Window size						*window-size*

[This is about the size of the whole window Vim is using, not a window that is
created with the ":split" command.]

If you are running Vim on an Amiga and the terminal name is "amiga" or
"builtin_amiga", the amiga-specific window resizing will be enabled.  On Unix
systems three methods are tried to get the window size:

- an ioctl call (TIOCGSIZE or TIOCGWINSZ, depends on your system)
- the environment variables "LINES" and "COLUMNS"
- from the termcap entries "li" and "co"

If everything fails a default size of 24 lines and 80 columns is assumed.  If
a window-resize signal is received the size will be set again.  If the window
size is wrong you can use the 'lines' and 'columns' options to set the
correct values.

One command can be used to set the screen size:

						*:mod* *:mode* *E359* *E362*
:mod[e] [mode]

Without argument this only detects the screen size and redraws the screen.
With MS-DOS it is possible to switch screen mode.  [mode] can be one of these
values:
	"bw40"		40 columns black&white
	"c40"		40 columns color
	"bw80"		80 columns black&white
	"c80"		80 columns color (most people use this)
	"mono"		80 columns monochrome
	"c4350"		43 or 50 lines EGA/VGA mode
	number		mode number to use, depends on your video card

==============================================================================
4. Slow and fast terminals			*slow-fast-terminal*
						*slow-terminal*

If you have a fast terminal you may like to set the 'ruler' option.  The
cursor position is shown in the status line.  If you are using horizontal
scrolling ('wrap' option off) consider setting 'sidescroll' to a small
number.

If you have a slow terminal you may want to reset the 'showcmd' option.
The command characters will not be shown in the status line.  If the terminal
scrolls very slowly, set the 'scrolljump' to 5 or so.  If the cursor is moved
off the screen (e.g., with "j") Vim will scroll 5 lines at a time.  Another
possibility is to reduce the number of lines that Vim uses with the command
"z{height}<CR>".

If the characters from the terminal are arriving with more than 1 second
between them you might want to set the 'timeout' and/or 'ttimeout' option.
See the "Options" chapter |options|.

If your terminal does not support a scrolling region, but it does support
insert/delete line commands, scrolling with multiple windows may make the
lines jump up and down.  If you don't want this set the 'ttyfast' option.
This will redraw the window instead of scroll it.

If your terminal scrolls very slowly, but redrawing is not slow, set the
'ttyscroll' option to a small number, e.g., 3.  This will make Vim redraw the
screen instead of scrolling, when there are more than 3 lines to be scrolled.

If you are using a color terminal that is slow, use this command: >
	hi NonText cterm=NONE ctermfg=NONE
This avoids that spaces are sent when they have different attributes.  On most
terminals you can't see this anyway.

If you are using Vim over a slow serial line, you might want to try running
Vim inside the "screen" program.  Screen will optimize the terminal I/O quite
a bit.

If you are testing termcap options, but you cannot see what is happening,
you might want to set the 'writedelay' option.  When non-zero, one character
is sent to the terminal at a time (does not work for MS-DOS).  This makes the
screen updating a lot slower, making it possible to see what is happening.

==============================================================================
5. Using the mouse					*mouse-using*

This section is about using the mouse on a terminal or a terminal window.  How
to use the mouse in a GUI window is explained in |gui-mouse|.  For scrolling
with a mouse wheel see |scroll-mouse-wheel|.

Don't forget to enable the mouse with this command: >
	:set mouse=a
Otherwise Vim won't recognize the mouse in all modes (See 'mouse').

Currently the mouse is supported for Unix in an xterm window, in a *BSD
console with |sysmouse|, in a Linux console (with GPM |gpm-mouse|), for
MS-DOS and in a Windows console.
Mouse clicks can be used to position the cursor, select an area and paste.

These characters in the 'mouse' option tell in which situations the mouse will
be used by Vim:
		n	Normal mode
		v	Visual mode
		i	Insert mode
		c	Command-line mode
		h	all previous modes when in a help file
		a	all previous modes
		r	for |hit-enter| prompt

The default for 'mouse' is empty, the mouse is not used.  Normally you would
do: >
	:set mouse=a
to start using the mouse (this is equivalent to setting 'mouse' to "nvich").
If you only want to use the mouse in a few modes or also want to use it for
the two questions you will have to concatenate the letters for those modes.
For example: >
	:set mouse=nv
Will make the mouse work in Normal mode and Visual mode. >
	:set mouse=h
Will make the mouse work in help files only (so you can use "g<LeftMouse>" to
jump to tags).

Whether the selection that is started with the mouse is in Visual mode or
Select mode depends on whether "mouse" is included in the 'selectmode'
option.

In an xterm, with the currently active mode included in the 'mouse' option,
normal mouse clicks are used by Vim, mouse clicks with the shift or ctrl key
pressed go to the xterm.  With the currently active mode not included in
'mouse' all mouse clicks go to the xterm.

							*xterm-clipboard*
In the Athena and Motif GUI versions, when running in a terminal and there is
access to the X-server (DISPLAY is set), the copy and paste will behave like
in the GUI.  If not, the middle mouse button will insert the unnamed register.
In that case, here is how you copy and paste a piece of text:

Copy/paste with the mouse and Visual mode ('mouse' option must be set, see
above):
1. Press left mouse button on first letter of text, move mouse pointer to last
   letter of the text and release the button.  This will start Visual mode and
   highlight the selected area.
2. Press "y" to yank the Visual text in the unnamed register.
3. Click the left mouse button at the insert position.
4. Click the middle mouse button.

Shortcut: If the insert position is on the screen at the same time as the
Visual text, you can do 2, 3 and 4 all in one: Click the middle mouse button
at the insert position.

Note: When the |-X| command line argument is used, Vim will not connect to the
X server and copy/paste to the X clipboard (selection) will not work.  Use the
shift key with the mouse buttons to let the xterm do the selection.

							*xterm-command-server*
When the X-server clipboard is available, the command server described in
|x11-clientserver| can be enabled with the --servername command line argument.

							*xterm-copy-paste*
NOTE: In some (older) xterms, it's not possible to move the cursor past column
95 or 223.  This is an xterm problem, not Vim's.  Get a newer xterm
|color-xterm|.  Also see |'ttymouse'|.

Copy/paste in xterm with (current mode NOT included in 'mouse'):
1. Press left mouse button on first letter of text, move mouse pointer to last
   letter of the text and release the button.
2. Use normal Vim commands to put the cursor at the insert position.
3. Press "a" to start Insert mode.
4. Click the middle mouse button.
5. Press ESC to end Insert mode.
(The same can be done with anything in 'mouse' if you keep the shift key
pressed while using the mouse.)

Note: if you lose the 8th bit when pasting (special characters are translated
into other characters), you may have to do "stty cs8 -istrip -parenb" in your
shell before starting Vim.

Thus in an xterm the shift and ctrl keys cannot be used with the mouse.  Mouse
commands requiring the CTRL modifier can be simulated by typing the "g" key
before using the mouse:
	"g<LeftMouse>"	is "<C-LeftMouse>	(jump to tag under mouse click)
	"g<RightMouse>" is "<C-RightMouse>	("CTRL-T")

					*mouse-mode-table* *mouse-overview*
A short overview of what the mouse buttons do, when 'mousemodel' is "extend":

Insert or Replace Mode:
event	      position	   selection	  change  action	~
	       cursor			  window		~
<S-LeftMouse>   yes     start or extend (1) no	   like CTRL-O (1)
<A-LeftMouse>   yes start or extend blockw. no
<RightMouse>    no	popup menu	    no

(1) only if mouse pointer moved since press
(2) only if click is in same buffer

Clicking the left mouse button causes the cursor to be positioned.  If the
click is in another window that window is made the active window.  When
editing the command-line the cursor can only be positioned on the
command-line.  When in Insert mode Vim remains in Insert mode.  If 'scrolloff'
is set, and the cursor is positioned within 'scrolloff' lines from the window
border, the text is scrolled.

A selection can be started by pressing the left mouse button on the first
character, moving the mouse to the last character, then releasing the mouse
button.  You will not always see the selection until you release the button,
only in some versions (GUI, MS-DOS, WIN32) will the dragging be shown
immediately.  Note that you can make the text scroll by moving the mouse at
least one character in the first/last line in the window when 'scrolloff' is
non-zero.

In Normal, Visual and Select mode clicking the right mouse button causes the
Visual area to be extended.  When 'mousemodel' is "popup", the left button has
to be used while keeping the shift key pressed.  When clicking in a window
which is editing another buffer, the Visual or Select mode is stopped.

In Normal, Visual and Select mode clicking the right mouse button with the alt
key pressed causes the Visual area to become blockwise.  When 'mousemodel' is
"popup" the left button has to be used with the alt key.  Note that this won't
work on systems where the window manager consumes the mouse events when the
alt key is pressed (it may move the window).

							*double-click*
Double, triple and quadruple clicks are supported when the GUI is active,
for MS-DOS and Win32, and for an xterm (if the gettimeofday() function is
available).  For selecting text, extra clicks extend the selection:
	click		select ~
	double		word or % match		*<2-LeftMouse>*
	triple		line			*<3-LeftMouse>*
	quadruple	rectangular block	*<4-LeftMouse>*
Exception: In a Help window a double click jumps to help for the word that is
clicked on.
A double click on a word selects that word.  'iskeyword' is used to specify
which characters are included in a word.  A double click on a character
that has a match selects until that match (like using "v%").  If the match is
an #if/#else/#endif block, the selection becomes linewise.
For MS-DOS and xterm the time for double clicking can be set with the
'mousetime' option.  For the other systems this time is defined outside of
Vim.
An example, for using a double click to jump to the tag under the cursor: >
	:map <2-LeftMouse> :exe "tag ". expand("<cword>")<CR>

Dragging the mouse with a double click (button-down, button-up, button-down
and then drag) will result in whole words to be selected.  This continues
until the button is released, at which point the selection is per character
again.

							*gpm-mouse*
The GPM mouse is only supported when the |+mouse_gpm| feature was enabled at
compile time.  The GPM mouse driver (Linux console) does not support quadruple
clicks.

In Insert mode, when a selection is started, Vim goes into Normal mode
temporarily.  When Visual or Select mode ends, it returns to Insert mode.
This is like using CTRL-O in Insert mode.  Select mode is used when the
'selectmode' option contains "mouse".
							*sysmouse*
The sysmouse is only supported when the |+mouse_sysmouse| feature was enabled
at compile time.  The sysmouse driver (*BSD console) does not support keyboard
modifiers.

							*drag-status-line*
When working with several windows, the size of the windows can be changed by
dragging the status line with the mouse.  Point the mouse at a status line,
press the left button, move the mouse to the new position of the status line,
release the button.  Just clicking the mouse in a status line makes that window
the current window, without moving the cursor.  If by selecting a window it
will change position or size, the dragging of the status line will look
confusing, but it will work (just try it).

					*<MiddleRelease>* *<MiddleDrag>*
Mouse clicks can be mapped.  The codes for mouse clicks are:
     code	    mouse button	      normal action	~
 <LeftMouse>	 left pressed		    set cursor position
 <LeftDrag>	 left moved while pressed   extend selection
 <LeftRelease>	 left released		    set selection end
 <MiddleMouse>	 middle pressed		    paste text at cursor position
 <MiddleDrag>	 middle moved while pressed -
 <MiddleRelease> middle released	    -
 <RightMouse>	 right pressed		    extend selection
 <RightDrag>	 right moved while pressed  extend selection
 <RightRelease>  right released		    set selection end
 <X1Mouse>	 X1 button pressed	    -			*X1Mouse*
 <X1Drag>	 X1 moved while pressed	    -			*X1Drag*
 <X1Release>	 X1 button release	    -			*X1Release*
 <X2Mouse>	 X2 button pressed	    -			*X2Mouse*
 <X2Drag>	 X2 moved while pressed     -			*X2Drag*
 <X2Release>	 X2 button release	    -			*X2Release*

The X1 and X2 buttons refer to the extra buttons found on some mice.  The
'Microsoft Explorer' mouse has these buttons available to the right thumb.
Currently X1 and X2 only work on Win32 environments.

Examples: >
	:noremap <MiddleMouse> <LeftMouse><MiddleMouse>
Paste at the position of the middle mouse button click (otherwise the paste
would be done at the cursor position). >

	:noremap <LeftRelease> <LeftRelease>y
Immediately yank the selection, when using Visual mode.

Note the use of ":noremap" instead of "map" to avoid a recursive mapping.
>
	:map <X1Mouse> <C-O>
	:map <X2Mouse> <C-I>
Map the X1 and X2 buttons to go forwards and backwards in the jump list, see
|CTRL-O| and |CTRL-I|.

						*mouse-swap-buttons*
To swap the meaning of the left and right mouse buttons: >
	:noremap	<LeftMouse>	<RightMouse>
	:noremap	<LeftDrag>	<RightDrag>
	:noremap	<LeftRelease>	<RightRelease>
	:noremap	<RightMouse>	<LeftMouse>
	:noremap	<RightDrag>	<LeftDrag>
	:noremap	<RightRelease>	<LeftRelease>
	:noremap	g<LeftMouse>	<C-RightMouse>
	:noremap	g<RightMouse>	<C-LeftMouse>
	:noremap!	<LeftMouse>	<RightMouse>
	:noremap!	<LeftDrag>	<RightDrag>
	:noremap!	<LeftRelease>	<RightRelease>
	:noremap!	<RightMouse>	<LeftMouse>
	:noremap!	<RightDrag>	<LeftDrag>
	:noremap!	<RightRelease>	<LeftRelease>

			       Using filetypes


When you are editing a file of a certain type, for example a C program or a
shell script, you often use the same option settings and mappings.  You
quickly get tired of manually setting these each time.  This chapter explains
how to do it automatically.

==============================================================================
*43.1*	Plugins for a filetype				*filetype-plugin*

How to start using filetype plugins has already been discussed here:
|add-filetype-plugin|.  But you probably are not satisfied with the default
settings, because they have been kept minimal.  Suppose that for C files you
want to set the 'softtabstop' option to 4 and define a mapping to insert a
three-line comment.  You do this with only two steps:

							*your-runtime-dir*
1. Create your own runtime directory.  On Unix this usually is "~/.vim".  In
   this directory create the "ftplugin" directory: >

	mkdir ~/.vim
	mkdir ~/.vim/ftplugin
<
   When you are not on Unix, check the value of the 'runtimepath' option to
   see where Vim will look for the "ftplugin" directory: >

	set runtimepath

<  You would normally use the first directory name (before the first comma).
   You might want to prepend a directory name to the 'runtimepath' option in
   your |vimrc| file if you don't like the default value.

2. Create the file "~/.vim/ftplugin/c.vim", with the contents: >

	setlocal softtabstop=4
	noremap <buffer> <LocalLeader>c o/**************<CR><CR>/<Esc>

Try editing a C file.  You should notice that the 'softtabstop' option is set
to 4.  But when you edit another file it's reset to the default zero.  That is
because the ":setlocal" command was used.  This sets the 'softtabstop' option
only locally to the buffer.  As soon as you edit another buffer, it will be
set to the value set for that buffer.  For a new buffer it will get the
default value or the value from the last ":set" command.

Likewise, the mapping for "\c" will disappear when editing another buffer.
The ":map <buffer>" command creates a mapping that is local to the current
buffer.  This works with any mapping command: ":map!", ":vmap", etc.  The
|<LocalLeader>| in the mapping is replaced with the value of the
"maplocalleader" variable.

You can find examples for filetype plugins in this directory: >

	$VIMRUNTIME/ftplugin/

More details about writing a filetype plugin can be found here:
|write-plugin|.

==============================================================================
*43.2*	Adding a filetype

If you are using a type of file that is not recognized by Vim, this is how to
get it recognized.  You need a runtime directory of your own.  See
|your-runtime-dir| above.

Create a file "filetype.vim" which contains an autocommand for your filetype.
(Autocommands were explained in section |40.3|.)  Example: >

	augroup filetypedetect
	au BufNewFile,BufRead *.xyz	setf xyz
	augroup END

This will recognize all files that end in ".xyz" as the "xyz" filetype.  The
":augroup" commands put this autocommand in the "filetypedetect" group.  This
allows removing all autocommands for filetype detection when doing ":filetype
off".  The "setf" command will set the 'filetype' option to its argument,
unless it was set already.  This will make sure that 'filetype' isn't set
twice.

You can use many different patterns to match the name of your file.  Directory
names can also be included.  See |autocmd-patterns|.  For example, the files
under "/usr/share/scripts/" are all "ruby" files, but don't have the expected
file name extension.  Adding this to the example above: >

	augroup filetypedetect
	au BufNewFile,BufRead *.xyz			setf xyz
	au BufNewFile,BufRead /usr/share/scripts/*	setf ruby
	augroup END

However, if you now edit a file /usr/share/scripts/README.txt, this is not a
ruby file.  The danger of a pattern ending in "*" is that it quickly matches
too many files.  To avoid trouble with this, put the filetype.vim file in
another directory, one that is at the end of 'runtimepath'.  For Unix for
example, you could use "~/.vim/after/filetype.vim".
   You now put the detection of text files in ~/.vim/filetype.vim: >

	augroup filetypedetect
	au BufNewFile,BufRead *.txt			setf text
	augroup END

That file is found in 'runtimepath' first.  Then use this in
~/.vim/after/filetype.vim, which is found last: >

	augroup filetypedetect
	au BufNewFile,BufRead /usr/share/scripts/*	setf ruby
	augroup END

What will happen now is that Vim searches for "filetype.vim" files in each
directory in 'runtimepath'.  First ~/.vim/filetype.vim is found.  The
autocommand to catch *.txt files is defined there.  Then Vim finds the
filetype.vim file in $VIMRUNTIME, which is halfway 'runtimepath'.  Finally
~/.vim/after/filetype.vim is found and the autocommand for detecting ruby
files in /usr/share/scripts is added.
   When you now edit /usr/share/scripts/README.txt, the autocommands are
checked in the order in which they were defined.  The *.txt pattern matches,
thus "setf text" is executed to set the filetype to "text".  The pattern for
ruby matches too, and the "setf ruby" is executed.  But since 'filetype' was
already set to "text", nothing happens here.
   When you edit the file /usr/share/scripts/foobar the same autocommands are
checked.  Only the one for ruby matches and "setf ruby" sets 'filetype' to
ruby.


RECOGNIZING BY CONTENTS

If your file cannot be recognized by its file name, you might be able to
recognize it by its contents.  For example, many script files start with a
line like:

	#!/bin/xyz ~

To recognize this script create a file "scripts.vim" in your runtime directory
(same place where filetype.vim goes).  It might look like this: >

	if did_filetype()
	  finish
	endif
	if getline(1) =~ '^#!.*[/\\]xyz\>'
	  setf xyz
	endif

The first check with did_filetype() is to avoid that you will check the
contents of files for which the filetype was already detected by the file
name.  That avoids wasting time on checking the file when the "setf" command
won't do anything.
   The scripts.vim file is sourced by an autocommand in the default
filetype.vim file.  Therefore, the order of checks is:

	1. filetype.vim files before $VIMRUNTIME in 'runtimepath'
	2. first part of $VIMRUNTIME/filetype.vim
	3. all scripts.vim files in 'runtimepath'
	4. remainder of $VIMRUNTIME/filetype.vim
	5. filetype.vim files after $VIMRUNTIME in 'runtimepath'

If this is not sufficient for you, add an autocommand that matches all files
and sources a script or executes a function to check the contents of the file.

			      Splitting windows


Display two different files above each other.  Or view two locations in the
file at the same time.  See the difference between two files by putting them
side by side.  All this is possible with split windows.

==============================================================================
*08.1*	Split a window

The easiest way to open a new window is to use the following command: >

	:split

This command splits the screen into two windows and leaves the cursor in the
top one:

	+----------------------------------+
	|/* file one.c */		   |
	|~				   |
	|~				   |
	|one.c=============================|
	|/* file one.c */		   |
	|~				   |
	|one.c=============================|
	|				   |
	+----------------------------------+

What you see here is two windows on the same file.  The line with "====" is
that status line.  It displays information about the window above it.  (In
practice the status line will be in reverse video.)
   The two windows allow you to view two parts of the same file.  For example,
you could make the top window show the variable declarations of a program, and
the bottom one the code that uses these variables.

The CTRL-W w command can be used to jump between the windows.  If you are in
the top window, CTRL-W w jumps to the window below it.  If you are in the
bottom window it will jump to the first window.  (CTRL-W CTRL-W does the same
thing, in case you let go of the CTRL key a bit later.)


CLOSE THE WINDOW

To close a window, use the command: >

	:close

Actually, any command that quits editing a file works, like ":quit" and "ZZ".
But ":close" prevents you from accidentally exiting Vim when you close the
last window.


CLOSING ALL OTHER WINDOWS

If you have opened a whole bunch of windows, but now want to concentrate on
one of them, this command will be useful: >

	:only

This closes all windows, except for the current one.  If any of the other
windows has changes, you will get an error message and that window won't be
closed.

==============================================================================
*08.2*	Split a window on another file

The following command opens a second window and starts editing the given file:
>
	:split two.c

If you were editing one.c, then the result looks like this:

	+----------------------------------+
	|/* file two.c */		   |
	|~				   |
	|~				   |
	|two.c=============================|
	|/* file one.c */		   |
	|~				   |
	|one.c=============================|
	|				   |
	+----------------------------------+

To open a window on a new, empty file, use this: >

	:new

You can repeat the ":split" and ":new" commands to create as many windows as
you like.

==============================================================================
*08.3*	Window size

The ":split" command can take a number argument.  If specified, this will be
the height of the new window.  For example, the following opens a new window
three lines high and starts editing the file alpha.c: >

	:3split alpha.c

For existing windows you can change the size in several ways.  When you have a
working mouse, it is easy: Move the mouse pointer to the status line that
separates two windows, and drag it up or down.

To increase the size of a window: >

	CTRL-W +

To decrease it: >

	CTRL-W -

Both of these commands take a count and increase or decrease the window size
by that many lines.  Thus "4 CTRL-W +" make the window four lines higher.

To set the window height to a specified number of lines: >

	{height}CTRL-W _

That's: a number {height}, CTRL-W and then an underscore (the - key with Shift
on English-US keyboards).
   To make a window as high as it can be, use the CTRL-W _ command without a
count.


USING THE MOUSE

In Vim you can do many things very quickly from the keyboard.  Unfortunately,
the window resizing commands require quite a bit of typing.  In this case,
using the mouse is faster.  Position the mouse pointer on a status line.  Now
press the left mouse button and drag.  The status line will move, thus making
the window on one side higher and the other smaller.


OPTIONS

The 'winheight' option can be set to a minimal desired height of a window and
'winminheight' to a hard minimum height.
   Likewise, there is 'winwidth' for the minimal desired width and
'winminwidth' for the hard minimum width.
   The 'equalalways' option, when set, makes Vim equalize the windows sizes
when a window is closed or opened.

==============================================================================
*08.4*	Vertical splits

The ":split" command creates the new window above the current one.  To make
the window appear at the left side, use: >

	:vsplit

or: >
	:vsplit two.c

The result looks something like this:

	+--------------------------------------+
	|/* file two.c */   |/* file one.c */  |
	|~		    |~		       |
	|~		    |~		       |
	|~		    |~		       |
	|two.c===============one.c=============|
	|				       |
	+--------------------------------------+

Actually, the | lines in the middle will be in reverse video.  This is called
the vertical separator.  It separates the two windows left and right of it.

There is also the ":vnew" command, to open a vertically split window on a new,
empty file.  Another way to do this: >

	:vertical new

The ":vertical" command can be inserted before another command that splits a
window.  This will cause that command to split the window vertically instead
of horizontally.  (If the command doesn't split a window, it works
unmodified.)


MOVING BETWEEN WINDOWS

Since you can split windows horizontally and vertically as much as you like,
you can create almost any layout of windows.  Then you can use these commands
to move between them:

	CTRL-W h	move to the window on the left
	CTRL-W j	move to the window below
	CTRL-W k	move to the window above
	CTRL-W l	move to the window on the right

	CTRL-W t	move to the TOP window
	CTRL-W b	move to the BOTTOM window

You will notice the same letters as used for moving the cursor.  And the
cursor keys can also be used, if you like.
   More commands to move to other windows: |Q_wi|.

==============================================================================
*08.5*	Moving windows

You have split a few windows, but now they are in the wrong place.  Then you
need a command to move the window somewhere else.  For example, you have three
windows like this:

	+----------------------------------+
	|/* file two.c */		   |
	|~				   |
	|~				   |
	|two.c=============================|
	|/* file three.c */		   |
	|~				   |
	|~				   |
	|three.c===========================|
	|/* file one.c */		   |
	|~				   |
	|one.c=============================|
	|				   |
	+----------------------------------+

Clearly the last one should be at the top.  Go to that window (using CTRL-W w)
and the type this command: >

	CTRL-W K

This uses the uppercase letter K.  What happens is that the window is moved to
the very top.  You will notice that K is again used for moving upwards.
   When you have vertical splits, CTRL-W K will move the current window to the
top and make it occupy the full width of the Vim window.  If this is your
layout:

	+-------------------------------------------+
	|/* two.c */  |/* three.c */  |/* one.c */  |
	|~	      |~	      |~	    |
	|~	      |~	      |~	    |
	|~	      |~	      |~	    |
	|~	      |~	      |~	    |
	|~	      |~	      |~	    |
	|two.c=========three.c=========one.c========|
	|					    |
	+-------------------------------------------+

Then using CTRL-W K in the middle window (three.c) will result in:

	+-------------------------------------------+
	|/* three.c */				    |
	|~					    |
	|~					    |
	|three.c====================================|
	|/* two.c */	       |/* one.c */	    |
	|~		       |~		    |
	|two.c==================one.c===============|
	|					    |
	+-------------------------------------------+

The other three similar commands (you can probably guess these now):

	CTRL-W H	move window to the far left
	CTRL-W J	move window to the bottom
	CTRL-W L	move window to the far right

==============================================================================
*08.6*	Commands for all windows

When you have several windows open and you want to quit Vim, you can close
each window separately.  A quicker way is using this command: >

	:qall

This stands for "quit all".  If any of the windows contain changes, Vim will
not exit.  The cursor will automatically be positioned in a window with
changes.  You can then either use ":write" to save the changes, or ":quit!" to
throw them away.

If you know there are windows with changes, and you want to save all these
changes, use this command: >

	:wall

This stands for "write all".  But actually, it only writes files with
changes.  Vim knows it doesn't make sense to write files that were not
changed.
   And then there is the combination of ":qall" and ":wall": the "write and
quit all" command: >

	:wqall

This writes all modified files and quits Vim.
   Finally, there is a command that quits Vim and throws away all changes: >

	:qall!

Be careful, there is no way to undo this command!


OPENING A WINDOW FOR ALL ARGUMENTS

To make Vim open a window for each file, start it with the "-o" argument: >

	vim -o one.txt two.txt three.txt

This results in:

	+-------------------------------+
	|file one.txt			|
	|~				|
	|one.txt========================|
	|file two.txt			|
	|~				|
	|two.txt========================|
	|file three.txt			|
	|~				|
	|three.txt======================|
	|				|
	+-------------------------------+

The "-O" argument is used to get vertically split windows.
   When Vim is already running, the ":all" command opens a window for each
file in the argument list.  ":vertical all" does it with vertical splits.

==============================================================================
*08.7*	Viewing differences with vimdiff

There is a special way to start Vim, which shows the differences between two
files.  Let's take a file "main.c" and insert a few characters in one line.
Write this file with the 'backup' option set, so that the backup file
"main.c~" will contain the previous version of the file.
   Type this command in a shell (not in Vim): >

	vimdiff main.c~ main.c

Vim will start, with two windows side by side.  You will only see the line
in which you added characters, and a few lines above and below it.

	 VV		      VV
	+-----------------------------------------+
	|+ +--123 lines: /* a|+ +--123 lines: /* a|  <- fold
	|  text		     |	text		  |
	|  text		     |	text		  |
	|  text		     |	text		  |
	|  text		     |	changed text	  |  <- changed line
	|  text		     |	text		  |
	|  text		     |	------------------|  <- deleted line
	|  text		     |	text		  |
	|  text		     |	text		  |
	|  text		     |	text		  |
	|+ +--432 lines: text|+ +--432 lines: text|  <- fold
	|  ~		     |	~		  |
	|  ~		     |	~		  |
	|main.c~==============main.c==============|
	|					  |
	+-----------------------------------------+

(This picture doesn't show the highlighting, use the vimdiff command for a
better look.)

The lines that were not modified have been collapsed into one line.  This is
called a closed fold.  They are indicated in the picture with "<- fold".  Thus
the single fold line at the top stands for 123 text lines.  These lines are
equal in both files.
   The line marked with "<- changed line" is highlighted, and the inserted
text is displayed with another color.  This clearly shows what the difference
is between the two files.
   The line that was deleted is displayed with "---" in the main.c window.
See the "<- deleted line" marker in the picture.  These characters are not
really there.  They just fill up main.c, so that it displays the same number
of lines as the other window.


THE FOLD COLUMN

Each window has a column on the left with a slightly different background.  In
the picture above these are indicated with "VV".  You notice there is a plus
character there, in front of each closed fold.  Move the mouse pointer to that
plus and click the left button.  The fold will open, and you can see the text
that it contains.
   The fold column contains a minus sign for an open fold.  If you click on
this -, the fold will close.
   Obviously, this only works when you have a working mouse.  You can also use
"zo" to open a fold and "zc" to close it.


DIFFING IN VIM

Another way to start in diff mode can be done from inside Vim.  Edit the
"main.c" file, then make a split and show the differences: >

	:edit main.c
	:vertical diffsplit main.c~ 

The ":vertical" command is used to make the window split vertically.  If you
omit this, you will get a horizontal split.

If you have a patch or diff file, you can use the third way to start diff
mode.  First edit the file to which the patch applies.  Then tell Vim the name
of the patch file: >

	:edit main.c
	:vertical diffpatch main.c.diff

WARNING: The patch file must contain only one patch, for the file you are
editing.  Otherwise you will get a lot of error messages, and some files might
be patched unexpectedly.
   The patching will only be done to the copy of the file in Vim.  The file on
your harddisk will remain unmodified (until you decide to write the file).


SCROLL BINDING

When the files have more changes, you can scroll in the usual way.  Vim will
try to keep both the windows start at the same position, so you can easily see
the differences side by side.
   When you don't want this for a moment, use this command: >

	:set noscrollbind


JUMPING TO CHANGES

When you have disabled folding in some way, it may be difficult to find the
changes.  Use this command to jump forward to the next change: >

	]c

To go the other way use: >

	[c

Prepended a count to jump further away.


REMOVING CHANGES

You can move text from one window to the other.  This either removes
differences or adds new ones.  Vim doesn't keep the highlighting updated in
all situations.  To update it use this command: >

	:diffupdate

To remove a difference, you can move the text in a highlighted block from one
window to another.  Take the "main.c" and "main.c~" example above.  Move the
cursor to the left window, on the line that was deleted in the other window.
Now type this command: >

	dp

The change will be removed by putting the text of the current window in the
other window.  "dp" stands for "diff put".
   You can also do it the other way around.  Move the cursor to the right
window, to the line where "changed" was inserted.  Now type this command: >

	do

The change will now be removed by getting the text from the other window.
Since there are no changes left now, Vim puts all text in a closed fold.
"do" stands for "diff obtain".  "dg" would have been better, but that already
has a different meaning ("dgg" deletes from the cursor until the first line).

For details about diff mode, see |vimdiff|.

==============================================================================
*08.8*	Various

The 'laststatus' option can be used to specify when the last window has a
statusline:

	0	never
	1	only when there are split windows (the default)
	2	always

Many commands that edit another file have a variant that splits the window.
For Command-line commands this is done by prepending an "s".  For example:
":tag" jumps to a tag, ":stag" splits the window and jumps to a
tag.
   For Normal mode commands a CTRL-W is prepended.  CTRL-^ jumps to the
alternate file, CTRL-W CTRL-^ splits the window and edits the alternate file.

The 'splitbelow' option can be set to make a new window appear below the
current window.  The 'splitright' option can be set to make a vertically split
window appear right of the current window.

When splitting a window you can prepend a modifier command to tell where the
window is to appear:

	:leftabove {cmd}	left or above the current window
	:aboveleft {cmd}	idem
	:rightbelow {cmd}	right or below the current window
	:belowright {cmd}	idem
	:topleft {cmd}		at the top or left of the Vim window
	:botright {cmd}		at the bottom or right of the Vim window


==============================================================================
*08.9*	Tab pages

You will have noticed that windows never overlap.  That means you quickly run
out of screen space.  The solution for this is called Tab pages.

Assume you are editing "thisfile".  To create a new tab page use this command: >

	:tabedit thatfile

This will edit the file "thatfile" in a window that occupies the whole Vim
window.  And you will notice a bar at the top with the two file names:

	+----------------------------------+
	| thisfile | /thatfile/ __________X|    (thatfile is bold)
	|/* thatfile */			   |
	|that				   |
	|that				   |
	|~				   |
	|~				   |
	|~				   |
	|				   |
	+----------------------------------+

You now have two tab pages.  The first one has a window for "thisfile" and the
second one a window for "thatfile".  It's like two pages that are on top of
each other, with a tab sticking out of each page showing the file name.

Now use the mouse to click on "thisfile" in the top line.  The result is

	+----------------------------------+
	| /thisfile/ | thatfile __________X|    (thisfile is bold)
	|/* thisfile */			   |
	|this				   |
	|this				   |
	|~				   |
	|~				   |
	|~				   |
	|				   |
	+----------------------------------+

Thus you can switch between tab pages by clicking on the label in the top
line.  If you don't have a mouse or don't want to use it, you can use the "gt"
command.  Mnemonic: Goto Tab.

Now let's create another tab page with the command: >

	:tab split

This makes a new tab page with one window that is editing the same buffer as
the window we were in:

	+-------------------------------------+
	| thisfile | /thisfile/ | thatfile __X|   (thisfile is bold)
	|/* thisfile */			      |
	|this				      |
	|this				      |
	|~				      |
	|~				      |
	|~				      |
	|				      |
	+-------------------------------------+

You can put ":tab" before any Ex command that opens a window.  The window will
be opened in a new tab page.  Another example: >

	:tab help gt

Will show the help text for "gt" in a new tab page.

A few more things you can do with tab pages:

- click with the mouse in the space after the last label
	The next tab page will be selected, like with "gt".

- click with the mouse on the "X" in the top right corner
	The current tab page will be closed.  Unless there are unsaved
	changes in the current tab page.

- double click with the mouse in the top line
	A new tab page will be created.

- the "tabonly" command
	Closes all tab pages except the current one.  Unless there are unsaved
	changes in other tab pages.

For more information about tab pages see |tab-page|.

				  Repeating


An editing task is hardly ever unstructured.  A change often needs to be made
several times.  In this chapter a number of useful ways to repeat a change
will be explained.

|26.1|	Repeating with Visual mode
|26.2|	Add and subtract
|26.3|	Making a change in many files
|26.4|	Using Vim from a shell script

Table of contents: |usr_toc.txt|

==============================================================================
*26.1*	Repeating with Visual mode

Visual mode is very handy for making a change in any sequence of lines.  You
can see the highlighted text, thus you can check if the correct lines are
changed.  But making the selection takes some typing.  The "gv" command
selects the same area again.  This allows you to do another operation on the
same text.
   Suppose you have some lines where you want to change "2001" to "2002" and
"2000" to "2001":

	The financial results for 2001 are better ~
	than for 2000.  The income increased by 50%, ~
	even though 2001 had more rain than 2000. ~
			2000		2001 ~
	income		45,403		66,234 ~

First change "2001" to "2002".  Select the lines in Visual mode, and use: >

	:s/2001/2002/g

Now use "gv" to reselect the same text.  It doesn't matter where the cursor
is.  Then use ":s/2000/2001/g" to make the second change.
   Obviously, you can repeat these changes several times.

==============================================================================
*26.2*	Add and subtract

When repeating the change of one number into another, you often have a fixed
offset.  In the example above, one was added to each year.  Instead of typing
a substitute command for each year that appears, the CTRL-A command can be
used.
   Using the same text as above, search for a year: >

	/19[0-9][0-9]\|20[0-9][0-9]

Now press CTRL-A.  The year will be increased by one:

	The financial results for 2002 are better ~
	than for 2000.  The income increased by 50%, ~
	even though 2001 had more rain than 2000. ~
			2000		2001 ~
	income		45,403		66,234 ~

Use "n" to find the next year, and press "." to repeat the CTRL-A ("." is a
bit quicker to type).  Repeat "n" and "." for all years that appear.
   Hint: set the 'hlsearch' option to see the matches you are going to change,
then you can look ahead and do it faster.

Adding more than one can be done by prepending the number to CTRL-A.  Suppose
you have this list:

	1.  item four ~
	2.  item five ~
	3.  item six ~

Move the cursor to "1." and type: >

	3 CTRL-A

The "1." will change to "4.".  Again, you can use "." to repeat this on the
other numbers.

Another example:

	006	foo bar ~
	007	foo bar ~

Using CTRL-A on these numbers results in:

	007	foo bar ~
	010	foo bar ~

7 plus one is 10?  What happened here is that Vim recognized "007" as an octal
number, because there is a leading zero.  This notation is often used in C
programs.  If you do not want a number with leading zeros to be handled as
octal, use this: >

	:set nrformats-=octal

The CTRL-X command does subtraction in a similar way.

==============================================================================
*26.3*	Making a change in many files

Suppose you have a variable called "x_cnt" and you want to change it to
"x_counter".  This variable is used in several of your C files.  You need to
change it in all files.  This is how you do it.
   Put all the relevant files in the argument list: >

	:args *.c
<
This finds all C files and edits the first one.  Now you can perform a
substitution command on all these files: >

	:argdo %s/\<x_cnt\>/x_counter/ge | update

The ":argdo" command takes an argument that is another command.  That command
will be executed on all files in the argument list.
   The "%s" substitute command that follows works on all lines.  It finds the
word "x_cnt" with "\<x_cnt\>".  The "\<" and "\>" are used to match the whole
word only, and not "px_cnt" or "x_cnt2".
   The flags for the substitute command include "g" to replace all occurrences
of "x_cnt" in the same line.  The "e" flag is used to avoid an error message
when "x_cnt" does not appear in the file.  Otherwise ":argdo" would abort on
the first file where "x_cnt" was not found.
   The "|" separates two commands.  The following "update" command writes the
file only if it was changed.  If no "x_cnt" was changed to "x_counter" nothing
happens.

There is also the ":windo" command, which executes its argument in all
windows.  And ":bufdo" executes its argument on all buffers.  Be careful with
this, because you might have more files in the buffer list than you think.
Check this with the ":buffers" command (or ":ls").

==============================================================================
*26.4*	Using Vim from a shell script

Suppose you have a lot of files in which you need to change the string
"-person-" to "Jones" and then print it.  How do you do that?  One way is to
do a lot of typing.  The other is to write a shell script to do the work.
   The Vim editor does a superb job as a screen-oriented editor when using
Normal mode commands.  For batch processing, however, Normal mode commands do
not result in clear, commented command files; so here you will use Ex mode
instead.  This mode gives you a nice command-line interface that makes it easy
to put into a batch file.  ("Ex command" is just another name for a
command-line (:) command.)
   The Ex mode commands you need are as follows: >

	%s/-person-/Jones/g
	write tempfile
	quit

You put these commands in the file "change.vim".  Now to run the editor in
batch mode, use this shell script: >

	for file in *.txt; do
	  vim -e -s $file < change.vim
	  lpr -r tempfile
	done

The for-done loop is a shell construct to repeat the two lines in between,
while the $file variable is set to a different file name each time.
   The second line runs the Vim editor in Ex mode (-e argument) on the file
$file and reads commands from the file "change.vim".  The -s argument tells
Vim to operate in silent mode.  In other words, do not keep outputting the
:prompt, or any other prompt for that matter.
   The "lpr -r tempfile" command prints the resulting "tempfile" and deletes
it (that's what the -r argument does).


READING FROM STDIN

Vim can read text on standard input.  Since the normal way is to read commands
there, you must tell Vim to read text instead.  This is done by passing the
"-" argument in place of a file.  Example: >

	ls | vim -

This allows you to edit the output of the "ls" command, without first saving
the text in a file.
   If you use the standard input to read text from, you can use the "-S"
argument to read a script: >

	producer | vim -S change.vim -


NORMAL MODE SCRIPTS

If you really want to use Normal mode commands in a script, you can use it
like this: >

	vim -s script file.txt ...
<
	Note:
	"-s" has a different meaning when it is used without "-e".  Here it
	means to source the "script" as Normal mode commands.  When used with
	"-e" it means to be silent, and doesn't use the next argument as a
	file name.

The commands in "script" are executed like you typed them.  Don't forget that
a line break is interpreted as pressing <Enter>.  In Normal mode that moves
the cursor to the next line.
   To create the script you can edit the script file and type the commands.
You need to imagine what the result would be, which can be a bit difficult.
Another way is to record the commands while you perform them manually.  This
is how you do that: >

	vim -w script file.txt ...

All typed keys will be written to "script".  If you make a small mistake you
can just continue and remember to edit the script later.
   The "-w" argument appends to an existing script.  That is good when you
want to record the script bit by bit.  If you want to start from scratch and
start all over, use the "-W" argument.  It overwrites any existing file.

			Execute Tcl script {script}.
			Note: This command doesn't work when the Tcl feature
			wasn't compiled in.  To avoid errors, see
			|script-here|.

{endmarker} must NOT be preceded by any white space.  If {endmarker} is
omitted from after the "<<", a dot '.' must be used after {script}, like for
the |:append| and |:insert| commands.
This form of the |:tcl| command is mainly useful for including tcl code in Vim
scripts.

Example: >
	function! DefineDate()
	    tcl << EOF
	    proc date {} {
		return [clock format [clock seconds]]
	    }
	EOF
	endfunction
<

							*:tcldo* *:tcld*
:[range]tcld[o] {cmd}	Execute Tcl command {cmd} for each line in [range]
			with the variable "line" being set to the text of each
			line in turn, and "lnum" to the line number.  Setting
			"line" will change the text, but note that it is not
			possible to add or delete lines using this command.
			If {cmd} returns an error, the command is interrupted.
			The default for [range] is the whole file: "1,$".
			See |tcl-var-line| and |tcl-var-lnum|.  {not in Vi}

							*:tclfile* *:tclf*
:tclf[ile] {file}	Execute the Tcl script in {file}.  This is the same as
			":tcl source {file}", but allows file name completion.
			{not in Vi}


Note that Tcl objects (like variables) persist from one command to the next,
just as in the Tcl shell.

Executing Tcl commands is not possible in the |sandbox|.

==============================================================================
2. Tcl commands						*tcl-commands*

Tcl code gets all of its access to vim via commands in the "::vim" namespace.
The following commands are implemented: >

	::vim::beep			# Guess.
	::vim::buffer {n}		# Create Tcl command for one buffer.
	::vim::buffer list		# Create Tcl commands for all buffers.
	::vim::command [-quiet] {cmd}	# Execute an Ex command.
	::vim::expr {expr}		# Use Vim's expression evaluator.
	::vim::option {opt}		# Get vim option.
	::vim::option {opt} {val}	# Set vim option.
	::vim::window list		# Create Tcl commands for all windows.

Commands:
	::vim::beep					*tcl-beep*
	Honk.  Does not return a result.

	::vim::buffer {n}				*tcl-buffer*
	::vim::buffer exists {n}
	::vim::buffer list
	Provides access to vim buffers.  With an integer argument, creates a
	buffer command (see |tcl-buffer-cmds|) for the buffer with that
	number, and returns its name as the result.  Invalid buffer numbers
	result in a standard Tcl error.  To test for valid buffer numbers,
	vim's internal functions can be used: >
		set nbufs [::vim::expr bufnr("$")]
		set isvalid [::vim::expr "bufexists($n)"]
<	The "list" option creates a buffer command for each valid buffer, and
	returns a list of the command names as the result.
	Example: >
		set bufs [::vim::buffer list]
		foreach b $bufs { $b append end "The End!" }
<	The "exists" option checks if a buffer with the given number exists.
	Example: >
		if { [::vim::buffer exists $n] } { ::vim::command ":e #$n" }
<	This command might be replaced by a variable in future versions.
	See also |tcl-var-current| for the current buffer.

	::vim::command {cmd}				*tcl-command*
	::vim::command -quiet {cmd}
	Execute the vim (ex-mode) command {cmd}.  Any Ex command that affects
	a buffer or window uses the current buffer/current window.  Does not
	return a result other than a standard Tcl error code.  After this
	command is completed, the "::vim::current" variable is updated.
	The "-quiet" flag suppresses any error messages from vim.
	Examples: >
		::vim::command "set ts=8"
		::vim::command "%s/foo/bar/g"
<	To execute normal-mode commands, use "normal" (see |:normal|): >
		set cmd "jj"
		::vim::command "normal $cmd"
<	See also |tcl-window-command| and |tcl-buffer-command|.

	::vim::expr {expr}				*tcl-expr*
	Evaluates the expression {expr} using vim's internal expression
	evaluator (see |expression|).   Any expression that queries a buffer
	or window property uses the current buffer/current window.  Returns
	the result as a string.  A |List| is turned into a string by joining
	the items and inserting line breaks.
	Examples: >
		set perl_available [::vim::expr has("perl")]
<	See also |tcl-window-expr| and |tcl-buffer-expr|.

	::vim::option {opt}				*tcl-option*
	::vim::option {opt} {value}
	Without second argument, queries the value of a vim option.  With this
	argument, sets the vim option to {value}, and returns the previous
	value as the result.  Any options that are marked as 'local to buffer'
	or 'local to window' affect the current buffer/current window.  The
	global value is not changed, use the ":set" command for that.  For
	boolean options, {value} should be "0" or "1", or any of the keywords
	"on", "off" or "toggle".  See |option-summary| for a list of options.
	Example: >
		::vim::option ts 8
<	See also |tcl-window-option| and |tcl-buffer-option|.

	::vim::window {option}				*tcl-window*
	Provides access to vim windows.  Currently only the "list" option is
	implemented.  This creates a window command (see |tcl-window-cmds|) for
	each window, and returns a list of the command names as the result.
	Example: >
		set wins [::vim::window list]
		foreach w $wins { $w height 4 }
<	This command might be replaced by a variable in future versions.
	See also |tcl-var-current| for the current window.

==============================================================================
3. Tcl variables					*tcl-variables*

The ::vim namespace contains a few variables.  These are created when the Tcl
interpreter is called from vim and set to current values. >

	::vim::current		# array containing "current" objects
	::vim::lbase		# number of first line
	::vim::range		# array containing current range numbers
	line			# current line as a string (:tcldo only)
	lnum			# current line number (:tcldo only)

Variables:
	::vim::current					*tcl-var-current*
	This is an array providing access to various "current" objects
	available in vim.  The contents of this array are updated after
	"::vim::command" is called, as this might change vim's current
	settings (e.g., by deleting the current buffer).
	The "buffer" element contains the name of the buffer command for the
	current buffer.  This can be used directly to invoke buffer commands
	(see |tcl-buffer-cmds|).  This element is read-only.
	Example: >
		$::vim::current(buffer) insert begin "Hello world"
<	The "window" element contains the name of the window command for the
	current window.  This can be used directly to invoke window commands
	(see |tcl-window-cmds|).  This element is read-only.
	Example: >
		$::vim::current(window) height 10
<
	::vim::lbase					*tcl-var-lbase*
	This variable controls how Tcl treats line numbers.  If it is set to
	'1', then lines and columns start at 1.  This way, line numbers from
	Tcl commands and vim expressions are compatible.  If this variable is
	set to '0', then line numbers and columns start at 0 in Tcl.  This is
	useful if you want to treat a buffer as a Tcl list or a line as a Tcl
	string and use standard Tcl commands that return an index ("lsort" or
	"string first", for example).  The default value is '1'.  Currently,
	any non-zero values is treated as '1', but your scripts should not
	rely on this.  See also |tcl-linenumbers|.

	::vim::range					*tcl-var-range*
	This is an array with three elements, "start", "begin" and "end".  It
	contains the line numbers of the start and end row of the current
	range.  "begin" is the same as "start".  This variable is read-only.
	See |tcl-examples|.

	line						*tcl-var-line*
	lnum						*tcl-var-lnum*
	These global variables are only available if the ":tcldo" Ex command
	is being executed.  They contain the text and line number of the
	current line.  When the Tcl command invoked by ":tcldo" is completed,
	the current line is set to the contents of the "line" variable, unless
	the variable was unset by the Tcl command.  The "lnum" variable is
	read-only.  These variables are not in the "::vim" namespace so they
	can be used in ":tcldo" without much typing (this might be changed in
	future versions).  See also |tcl-linenumbers|.

==============================================================================
4. Tcl window commands					*tcl-window-cmds*

Window commands represent vim windows.  They are created by several commands:
	::vim::window list			|tcl-window|
	"windows" option of a buffer command	|tcl-buffer-windows|
The ::vim::current(window) variable contains the name of the window command
for the current window.  A window command is automatically deleted when the
corresponding vim window is closed.

Let's assume the name of the window command is stored in the Tcl variable "win",
i.e. "$win" calls the command.  The following options are available: >

	$win buffer		# Create Tcl command for window's buffer.
	$win command {cmd}	# Execute Ex command in windows context.
	$win cursor		# Get current cursor position.
	$win cursor {var}	# Set cursor position from array variable.
	$win cursor {row} {col}	# Set cursor position.
	$win delcmd {cmd}	# Call Tcl command when window is closed.
	$win expr {expr}	# Evaluate vim expression in windows context.
	$win height		# Report the window's height.
	$win height {n}		# Set the window's height.
	$win option {opt} [val]	# Get/Set vim option in windows context.

Options:
	$win buffer					*tcl-window-buffer*
	Creates a Tcl command for the window's buffer, and returns its name as
	the result.  The name should be stored in a variable: >
		set buf [$win buffer]
<	$buf is now a valid Tcl command.  See |tcl-buffer-cmds| for the
	available options.

	$win cursor					*tcl-window-cursor*
	$win cursor {var}
	$win cursor {row} {col}
	Without argument, reports the current cursor position as a string.
	This can be converted to a Tcl array variable: >
		array set here [$win cursor]
<	"here(row)" and "here(column)" now contain the cursor position.
	With a single argument, the argument is interpreted as the name of a
	Tcl array variable, which must contain two elements "row" and "column".
	These are used to set the cursor to the new position: >
		$win cursor here	;# not $here !
<	With two arguments, sets the cursor to the specified row and column: >
		$win cursor $here(row) $here(column)
<	Invalid positions result in a standard Tcl error, which can be caught
	with "catch".  The row and column values depend on the "::vim::lbase"
	variable.  See |tcl-var-lbase|.

	$win delcmd {cmd}				*tcl-window-delcmd*
	Registers the Tcl command {cmd} as a deletion callback for the window.
	This command is executed (in the global scope) just before the window
	is closed.  Complex commands should be build with "list": >
		$win delcmd [list puts vimerr "window deleted"]
<	See also |tcl-buffer-delcmd|.

	$win height					*tcl-window-height*
	$win height {n}
	Without argument, reports the window's current height.  With an
	argument, tries to set the window's height to {n}, then reports the
	new height (which might be different from {n}).

	$win command [-quiet] {cmd}			*tcl-window-command*
	$win expr {expr}				*tcl-window-expr*
	$win option {opt} [val]				*tcl-window-option*
	These are similar to "::vim::command" etc., except that everything is
	done in the context of the window represented by $win, instead of the
	current window.  For example, setting an option that is marked 'local
	to window' affects the window $win.  Anything that affects or queries
	a buffer uses the buffer displayed in this window (i.e. the buffer
	that is represented by "$win buffer").  See |tcl-command|, |tcl-expr|
	and |tcl-option| for more information.
	Example: >
		$win option number on

==============================================================================
5. Tcl buffer commands					*tcl-buffer-cmds*

Buffer commands represent vim buffers.  They are created by several commands:
	::vim::buffer {N}			|tcl-buffer|
	::vim::buffer list			|tcl-buffer|
	"buffer" option of a window command	|tcl-window-buffer|
The ::vim::current(buffer) variable contains the name of the buffer command
for the current buffer.  A buffer command is automatically deleted when the
corresponding vim buffer is destroyed.  Whenever the buffer's contents are
changed, all marks in the buffer are automatically adjusted.  Any changes to
the buffer's contents made by Tcl commands can be undone with the "undo" vim
command (see |undo|).

Let's assume the name of the buffer command is stored in the Tcl variable "buf",
i.e. "$buf" calls the command.  The following options are available: >

	$buf append {n} {str}	# Append a line to buffer, after line {n}.
	$buf command {cmd}	# Execute Ex command in buffers context.
	$buf count		# Report number of lines in buffer.
	$buf delcmd {cmd}	# Call Tcl command when buffer is deleted.
	$buf delete {n}		# Delete a single line.
	$buf delete {n} {m}	# Delete several lines.
	$buf expr {expr}	# Evaluate vim expression in buffers context.
	$buf get {n}		# Get a single line as a string.
	$buf get {n} {m}	# Get several lines as a list.
	$buf insert {n} {str}	# Insert a line in buffer, as line {n}.
	$buf last		# Report line number of last line in buffer.
	$buf mark {mark}	# Report position of buffer mark.
	$buf name		# Report name of file in buffer.
	$buf number		# Report number of this buffer.
	$buf option {opt} [val]	# Get/Set vim option in buffers context.
	$buf set {n} {text}	# Replace a single line.
	$buf set {n} {m} {list}	# Replace several lines.
	$buf windows		# Create Tcl commands for buffer's windows.
<
							*tcl-linenumbers*
Most buffer commands take line numbers as arguments.  How Tcl treats these
numbers depends on the "::vim::lbase" variable (see |tcl-var-lbase|).  Instead
of line numbers, several keywords can be also used: "top", "start", "begin",
"first", "bottom", "end" and "last".

Options:
	$buf append {n} {str}				*tcl-buffer-append*
	$buf insert {n} {str}				*tcl-buffer-insert*
	Add a line to the buffer.  With the "insert" option, the string
	becomes the new line {n}, with "append" it is inserted after line {n}.
	Example: >
		$buf insert top "This is the beginning."
		$buf append end "This is the end."
<	To add a list of lines to the buffer, use a loop: >
		foreach line $list { $buf append $num $line ; incr num }
<
	$buf count					*tcl-buffer-count*
	Reports the total number of lines in the buffer.

	$buf delcmd {cmd}				*tcl-buffer-delcmd*
	Registers the Tcl command {cmd} as a deletion callback for the buffer.
	This command is executed (in the global scope) just before the buffer
	is deleted.  Complex commands should be build with "list": >
		$buf delcmd [list puts vimerr "buffer [$buf number] gone"]
<	See also |tcl-window-delcmd|.

	$buf delete {n}					*tcl-buffer-delete*
	$buf delete {n} {m}
	Deletes line {n} or lines {n} through {m} from the buffer.
	This example deletes everything except the last line: >
		$buf delete first [expr [$buf last] - 1]
<
	$buf get {n}					*tcl-buffer-get*
	$buf get {n} {m}
	Gets one or more lines from the buffer.  For a single line, the result
	is a string; for several lines, a list of strings.
	Example: >
		set topline [$buf get top]
<
	$buf last					*tcl-buffer-last*
	Reports the line number of the last line.  This value depends on the
	"::vim::lbase" variable.  See |tcl-var-lbase|.

	$buf mark {mark}				*tcl-buffer-mark*
	Reports the position of the named mark as a string, similar to the
	cursor position of the "cursor" option of a window command (see
	|tcl-window-cursor|).  This can be converted to a Tcl array variable: >
		array set mpos [$buf mark "a"]
<	"mpos(column)" and "mpos(row)" now contain the position of the mark.
	If the mark is not set, a standard Tcl error results.

	$buf name
	Reports the name of the file in the buffer.  For a buffer without a
	file, this is an empty string.

	$buf number
	Reports the number of this buffer.  See |:buffers|.
	This example deletes a buffer from vim: >
		::vim::command "bdelete [$buf number]"
<
	$buf set {n} {string}				*tcl-buffer-set*
	$buf set {n} {m} {list}
	Replace one or several lines in the buffer.  If the list contains more
	elements than there are lines to replace, they are inserted into the
	buffer.  If the list contains fewer elements, any unreplaced line is
	deleted from the buffer.

	$buf windows					*tcl-buffer-windows*
	Creates a window command for each window that displays this buffer, and
	returns a list of the command names as the result.
	Example: >
		set winlist [$buf windows]
		foreach win $winlist { $win height 4 }
<	See |tcl-window-cmds| for the available options.

	$buf command [-quiet] {cmd}			*tcl-buffer-command*
	$buf expr {expr}				*tcl-buffer-expr*
	$buf option {opt} [val]				*tcl-buffer-option*
	These are similar to "::vim::command" etc., except that everything is
	done in the context of the buffer represented by $buf, instead of the
	current buffer.  For example, setting an option that is marked 'local
	to buffer' affects the buffer $buf.  Anything that affects or queries
	a window uses the first window in vim's window list that displays this
	buffer (i.e. the first entry in the list returned by "$buf windows").
	See |tcl-command|, |tcl-expr| and |tcl-option| for more information.
	Example: >
		if { [$buf option modified] } { $buf command "w" }

==============================================================================
6. Miscellaneous; Output from Tcl		*tcl-misc* *tcl-output*

The standard Tcl commands "exit" and "catch" are replaced by custom versions.
"exit" terminates the current Tcl script and returns to vim, which deletes the
Tcl interpreter.  Another call to ":tcl" then creates a new Tcl interpreter.
"exit" does NOT terminate vim!  "catch" works as before, except that it does
not prevent script termination from "exit".  An exit code != 0 causes the ex
command that invoked the Tcl script to return an error.

Two new I/O streams are available in Tcl, "vimout" and "vimerr".  All output
directed to them is displayed in the vim message area, as information messages
and error messages, respectively.  The standard Tcl output streams stdout and
stderr are mapped to vimout and vimerr, so that a normal "puts" command can be
used to display messages in vim.

==============================================================================
7. Known bugs & problems				*tcl-bugs*

Calling one of the Tcl Ex commands from inside Tcl (via "::vim::command") may
have unexpected side effects.  The command creates a new interpreter, which
has the same abilities as the standard interpreter - making "::vim::command"
available in a safe child interpreter therefore makes the child unsafe.  (It
would be trivial to block nested :tcl* calls or ensure that such calls from a
safe interpreter create only new safe interpreters, but quite pointless -
depending on vim's configuration, "::vim::command" may execute arbitrary code
in any number of other scripting languages.)  A call to "exit" within this new
interpreter does not affect the old interpreter; it only terminates the new
interpreter, then script processing continues normally in the old interpreter.

Input from stdin is currently not supported.

==============================================================================
8. Examples:						*tcl-examples*

Here are a few small (and maybe useful) Tcl scripts.

This script sorts the lines of the entire buffer (assume it contains a list
of names or something similar):
	set buf $::vim::current(buffer)
	set lines [$buf get top bottom]
	set lines [lsort -dictionary $lines]
	$buf set top bottom $lines

This script reverses the lines in the buffer.  Note the use of "::vim::lbase"
and "$buf last" to work with any line number setting.
	set buf $::vim::current(buffer)
	set t $::vim::lbase
	set b [$buf last]
	while { $t < $b } {
		set tl [$buf get $t]
		set bl [$buf get $b]
		$buf set $t $bl
		$buf set $b $tl
		incr t
		incr b -1
	}

This script adds a consecutive number to each line in the current range:
	set buf $::vim::current(buffer)
	set i $::vim::range(start)
	set n 1
	while { $i <= $::vim::range(end) } {
		set line [$buf get $i]
		$buf set $i "$n\t$line"
		incr i ; incr n
	}

The same can also be done quickly with two Ex commands, using ":tcldo":
	:tcl set n 1
	:[range]tcldo set line "$n\t$line" ; incr n

This procedure runs an Ex command on each buffer (idea stolen from Ron Aaron):
	proc eachbuf { cmd } {
		foreach b [::vim::buffer list] {
			$b command $cmd
		}
	}
Use it like this:
	:tcl eachbuf %s/foo/bar/g
Be careful with Tcl's string and backslash substitution, tough.  If in doubt,
surround the Ex command with curly braces.


If you want to add some Tcl procedures permanently to vim, just place them in
a file (e.g. "~/.vimrc.tcl" on Unix machines), and add these lines to your
startup file (usually "~/.vimrc" on Unix):
	if has("tcl")
		tclfile ~/.vimrc.tcl
	endif

==============================================================================
9. Dynamic loading					*tcl-dynamic*

On MS-Windows the Tcl library can be loaded dynamically.  The |:version|
output then includes |+tcl/dyn|.

This means that Vim will search for the Tcl DLL file only when needed.  When
you don't use the Tcl interface you don't need it, thus you can use Vim
without this DLL file.

To use the Tcl interface the Tcl DLL must be in your search path.  In a
console window type "path" to see what directories are used.

The name of the DLL must match the Tcl version Vim was compiled with.
Currently the name is "tcl83.dll".  That is for Tcl 8.3.  To know for sure
edit "gvim.exe" and search for "tcl\d*.dll\c".

==============================================================================
1. Syntax Highlighting ~
							       *ft-ada-syntax*

This mode is designed for the 2005 edition of Ada ("Ada 2005"), which includes
support for objected-programming, protected types, and so on.  It handles code
written for the original Ada language ("Ada83", "Ada87", "Ada95") as well,
though code which uses Ada 2005-only keywords will be wrongly colored (such
code should be fixed anyway).  For more information about Ada, see
http://www.adapower.com.

The Ada mode handles a number of situations cleanly.

For example, it knows that the "-" in "-5" is a number, but the same character
in "A-5" is an operator.  Normally, a "with" or "use" clause referencing
another compilation unit is coloured the same way as C's "#include" is coloured.
If you have "Conditional" or "Repeat" groups coloured differently, then "end
if" and "end loop" will be coloured as part of those respective groups.

You can set these to different colours using vim's "highlight" command (e.g.,
to change how loops are displayed, enter the command ":hi Repeat" followed by
the colour specification; on simple terminals the colour specification
ctermfg=White often shows well).

There are several options you can select in this Ada mode. See |ft-ada-options|
for a complete list.

To enable them, assign a value to the option.  For example, to turn one on:
 >
    > let g:ada_standard_types = 1
>
To disable them use ":unlet".  Example:
>
    > unlet g:ada_standard_types

You can just use ":" and type these into the command line to set these
temporarily before loading an Ada file.  You can make these option settings
permanent by adding the "let" command(s), without a colon, to your "~/.vimrc"
file.

Even on a slow (90Mhz) PC this mode works quickly, but if you find the
performance unacceptable, turn on |g:ada_withuse_ordinary|.

Syntax folding instructions (|fold-syntax|) are added when |g:ada_folding| is
set.

==============================================================================
2. File type Plug-in ~
					       *ft-ada-indent* *ft-ada-plugin*

The Ada plug-in provides support for:

 - auto indenting	(|indent.txt|)
 - insert completion	(|i_CTRL-N|)
 - user completion	(|i_CTRL-X_CTRL-U|)
 - tag searches		(|tagsrch.txt|)
 - Quick Fix		(|quickfix.txt|)
 - backspace handling	(|'backspace'|)
 - comment handling	(|'comments'|, |'commentstring'|)

The plug-in only activates the features of the Ada mode whenever an Ada
file is opened and adds Ada related entries to the main and pop-up menu.

==============================================================================
3. Omni Completion ~
								 *ft-ada-omni*

The Ada omni-completions (|i_CTRL-X_CTRL-O|) uses tags database created either
by "gnat xref -v" or the "exuberant Ctags (http://ctags.sourceforge.net).  The
complete function will automatically detect which tool was used to create the
tags file.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3.1 Omni Completion with "gnat xref" ~
								   *gnat-xref*

GNAT XREF uses the compiler internal information (ali-files) to produce the
tags file. This has the advantage to be 100% correct and the option of deep
nested analysis. However the code must compile, the generator is quite
slow and the created tags file contains only the basic Ctags information for
each entry - not enough for some of the more advanced Vim code browser
plug-ins.

NOTE: "gnat xref -v" is very tricky to use as it has almost no diagnostic
       output - If nothing is printed then usually the parameters are wrong.
       Here some important tips:

1)  You need to compile your code first and use the "-aO" option to point to
    your .ali files.
2)  "gnat xref -v ../Include/adacl.ads" won't work - use  the "gnat xref -v
    -aI../Include adacl.ads" instead.
3)  "gnat xref -v -aI../Include *.ad?" won't work - use "cd ../Include" and
    then "gnat xref -v *.ad?"
4)  Project manager support is completely broken - don't even try "gnat xref
    -Padacl.gpr".
5)  VIM is faster when the tags file is sorted - use "sort --unique
    --ignore-case --output=tags tags" .
6)  Remember to insert "!_TAG_FILE_SORTED 2 %sort ui" as first line to mark
    the file assorted.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3.2 Omni Completion with "ctags"~
								   *ada-ctags*

Exuberant Ctags uses its own multi-language code parser. The parser is quite
fast, produces a lot of extra information (hence the name "Exuberant Ctags")
and can run on files which currently do not compile.

There are also lots of other Vim-tools which use exuberant Ctags.

You will need to install a version of the Exuberant Ctags which has Ada
support patched in. Such a version is available from the GNU Ada Project
(http://gnuada.sourceforge.net).

The Ada parser for Exuberant Ctags is fairly new - don't expect complete
support yet.

==============================================================================
4. Compiler Support ~
								*ada-compiler*

The Ada mode supports more than one Ada compiler and will automatically load the
compiler set in |g:ada_default_compiler| whenever an Ada source is opened. The
provided compiler plug-ins are split into the actual compiler plug-in and a
collection of support functions and variables. This allows the easy
development of specialized compiler plug-ins fine tuned to your development
environment.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
4.1 GNAT ~
							       *compiler-gnat*

GNAT is the only free (beer and speech) Ada compiler available. There are
several versions available which differ in the licence terms used.

The GNAT compiler plug-in will perform a compile on pressing <F7> and then
immediately shows the result. You can set the project file to be used by
setting:
 >
 > call g:gnat.Set_Project_File ('my_project.gpr')

Setting a project file will also create a Vim session (|views-sessions|) so -
like with the GPS - opened files, window positions etc. will be remembered
separately for all projects.

								*gnat_members*
GNAT OBJECT ~

							       *g:gnat.Make()*
g:gnat.Make()
		Calls |g:gnat.Make_Command| and displays the result inside a
               |quickfix| window.

							     *g:gnat.Pretty()*
g:gnat.Pretty()
		Calls |g:gnat.Pretty_Program|

							       *g:gnat.Find()*
g:gnat.Find()
		Calls |g:gnat.Find_Program|

							       *g:gnat.Tags()*
g:gnat.Tags()
		Calls |g:gnat.Tags_Command|

						   *g:gnat.Set_Project_File()*
g:gnat.Set_Project_File([{file}])
		Set gnat project file and load associated session.  An open
		project will be closed and the session written.  If called
		without file name the file selector opens for selection of a
		project file. If called with an empty string then the project
		and associated session are closed.

							 *g:gnat.Project_File*
g:gnat.Project_File	string
		Current project file.

							 *g:gnat.Make_Command*
g:gnat.Make_Command	string
		External command used for |g:gnat.Make()| (|'makeprg'|).

						       *g:gnat.Pretty_Program*
g:gnat.Pretty_Program	string
		External command used for |g:gnat.Pretty()|

							 *g:gnat.Find_Program*
g:gnat.Find_Program	string
		External command used for |g:gnat.Find()|

							 *g:gnat.Tags_Command*
g:gnat.Tags_Command	string
		External command used for |g:gnat.Tags()|

							 *g:gnat.Error_Format*
g:gnat.Error_Format	string
		Error format (|'errorformat'|)

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
4.2 Dec Ada ~
					    *compiler-hpada* *compiler-decada*
					*compiler-vaxada* *compiler-compaqada*

Dec Ada (also known by - in chronological order - VAX Ada, Dec Ada, Compaq Ada
and HP Ada) is a fairly dated Ada 83 compiler. Support is basic: <F7> will
compile the current unit.

The Dec Ada compiler expects the package name and not the file name to be
passed as a parameter. The compiler plug-in supports the usual file name
convention to convert the file into a unit name. Both '-' and '__' are allowed
as separators.

							      *decada_members*
DEC ADA OBJECT ~

							     *g:decada.Make()*
g:decada.Make()		function
		Calls |g:decada.Make_Command| and displays the result inside a
		|quickfix| window.

							*g:decada.Unit_Name()*
g:decada.Unit_Name()	function
		Get the Unit name for the current file.

						       *g:decada.Make_Command*
g:decada.Make_Command	string
		External command used for |g:decada.Make()| (|'makeprg'|).

						       *g:decada.Error_Format*
g:decada.Error_Format|	string
		Error format (|'errorformat'|).

		Highlight lines which are too long. Note: This highlighting
		option is quite CPU intensive.

							 *g:ada_rainbow_color*
g:ada_rainbow_color	  bool (true when exists)
		Use rainbow colours for '(' and ')'. You need the
		rainbow_parenthesis for this to work.

							       *g:ada_folding*
g:ada_folding		  set ('sigpft')
		Use folding for Ada sources.
		    's':    activate syntax folding on load
			'p':    fold packages
			'f':    fold functions and procedures
			't':    fold types
			'c':    fold conditionals
		    'g':    activate gnat pretty print folding on load

			'b':	lone 'begin' folded with line above
			'p':	lone 'private' folded with line above
			'x':	lone 'exception' folded with line above
		    'i':    activate indent folding on load

		Note: Syntax folding is in an early (unusable) stage and
		      indent or gnat pretty folding is suggested.

		For gnat pretty folding to work the following settings are
		suggested: -cl3 -M79 -c2 -c3 -c4 -A1 -A2 -A3 -A4 -A5

		For indent folding to work the following settings are
		suggested: shiftwidth=3 softtabstop=3

								*g:ada_abbrev*
g:ada_abbrev		  bool (true when exists)
		Add some abbreviations. This feature is more or less superseded
		by the various completion methods.

						      *g:ada_withuse_ordinary*
g:ada_withuse_ordinary	  bool (true when exists)
		Show "with" and "use" as ordinary keywords (when used to
		reference other compilation units they're normally highlighted
		specially).

g:ada_begin_preproc	  bool (true when exists)
		Show all begin-like keywords using the colouring of C
		preprocessor commands.

						    *g:ada_omni_with_keywords*
g:ada_omni_with_keywords

g:ada_extended_tagging	  enum ('jump', 'list')
		use extended tagging, two options are available
		    'jump': use tjump to jump.
		    'list': add tags quick fix list.
		Normal tagging does not support function or operator
		overloading as these features are not available in C and
		tagging was originally developed for C.

						   *g:ada_extended_completion*
g:ada_extended_completion
		Uses extended completion for <C-N> and <C-R> completions
		(|i_CTRL-N|). In this mode the '.' is used as part of the
		identifier so that 'Object.Method' or 'Package.Procedure' are
		completed together.

						       *g:ada_gnat_extensions*
g:ada_gnat_extensions	  bool (true when exists)
		 Support GNAT extensions.

					       *g:ada_with_gnat_project_files*
g:ada_with_gnat_project_files	 bool (true when exists)
		 Add gnat project file keywords and Attributes.

						      *g:ada_default_compiler*
g:ada_default_compiler	  string
		set default compiler. Currently supported are 'gnat' and
		'decada'.

An "exists" type is a boolean considered true when the variable is defined and
false when the variable is undefined. The value to which the variable is set
makes no difference.

==============================================================================
6. Extra Plugins ~
							   *ada-extra-plugins*

You can optionally install the following extra plug-ins. They work well with
Ada and enhance the ability of the Ada mode:

backup.vim
	http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=1537
	Keeps as many backups as you like so you don't have to.

rainbow_parenthsis.vim
	http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=1561
	Very helpful since Ada uses only '(' and ')'.

nerd_comments.vim
	http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=1218
	Excellent commenting and uncommenting support for almost any
	programming language.

matchit.vim
	http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=39
	'%' jumping for any language. The normal '%' jump only works for '{}'
	style languages. The Ada mode will set the needed search patterns.

taglist.vim
	http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=273
	Source code explorer sidebar. There is a patch for Ada available.

The GNU Ada Project distribution (http://gnuada.sourceforge.net) of Vim
contains all of the above.

Vim has various commands that aid in writing computer programs.  Compile a
program and directly jump to reported errors.  Automatically set the indent
for many languages and format comments.

Table of contents: |usr_toc.txt|

==============================================================================
*30.1*	Compiling

Vim has a set of so called "quickfix" commands.  They enable you to compile a
program from within Vim and then go through the errors generated and fix them
(hopefully).  You can then recompile and fix any new errors that are found
until finally your program compiles without any error.

The following command runs the program "make" (supplying it with any argument
you give) and captures the results: >

	:make {arguments}

If errors were generated, they are captured and the editor positions you where
the first error occurred.
   Take a look at an example ":make" session.  (Typical :make sessions generate
far more errors and fewer stupid ones.)  After typing ":make" the screen looks
like this:

	:!make | &tee /tmp/vim215953.err ~
	gcc -g -Wall -o prog main.c sub.c ~
	main.c: In function 'main': ~
	main.c:6: too many arguments to function 'do_sub' ~
	main.c: At top level: ~
	main.c:10: parse error before '}' ~
	make: *** [prog] Error 1 ~

	2 returned ~
	"main.c" 11L, 111C ~
	(3 of 6): too many arguments to function 'do_sub' ~
	Press ENTER or type command to continue ~

From this you can see that you have errors in the file "main.c".  When you
press <Enter>, Vim displays the file "main.c", with the cursor positioned on
line 6, the first line with an error.  You did not need to specify the file or
the line number, Vim knew where to go by looking in the error messages.

		+---------------------------------------------------+
		|int main()					    |
		|{						    |
		|	int i=3;				    |
      cursor -> |	do_sub("foo");				    |
		|	++i;					    |
		|	return (0);				    |
		|}						    |
		|}						    |
		| ~						    |
		|(3 of 12): too many arguments to function 'do_sub' |
		+---------------------------------------------------+

The following command goes to where the next error occurs: >

	:cnext

Vim jumps to line 10, the last line in the file, where there is an extra '}'.
   When there is not enough room, Vim will shorten the error message.  To see
the whole message use: >

	:cc

You can get an overview of all the error messages with the ":clist" command.
The output looks like this: >

	:clist
<	3 main.c: 6:too many arguments to function 'do_sub' ~
	5 main.c: 10:parse error before '}' ~

Only the lines where Vim recognized a file name and line number are listed
here.  It assumes those are the interesting lines and the rest is just boring
messages.  However, sometimes unrecognized lines do contain something you want
to see.  Output from the linker, for example, about an undefined function.
To see all the messages add a "!" to the command: >

	:clist!
<	1 gcc -g -Wall -o prog main.c sub.c ~
	2 main.c: In function 'main': ~
	3 main.c:6: too many arguments to function 'do_sub' ~
	4 main.c: At top level: ~
	5 main.c:10: parse error before '}' ~
	6 make: *** [prog] Error 1 ~

Vim will highlight the current error.  To go back to the previous error, use:
>
	:cprevious

Other commands to move around in the error list:

	:cfirst		to first error
	:clast		to last error
	:cc 3		to error nr 3


USING ANOTHER COMPILER

The name of the program to run when the ":make" command is executed is defined
by the 'makeprg' option.  Usually this is set to "make", but Visual C++ users
should set this to "nmake" by executing the following command: >

	:set makeprg=nmake

You can also include arguments in this option.  Special characters need to
be escaped with a backslash.  Example: >

	:set makeprg=nmake\ -f\ project.mak

You can include special Vim keywords in the command specification.  The %
character expands to the name of the current file.  So if you execute the
command: >
	:set makeprg=make\ %:S

When you are editing main.c, then ":make" executes the following command: >

	make main.c

This is not too useful, so you will refine the command a little and use the :r
(root) modifier: >

	:set makeprg=make\ %:r:S.o

Now the command executed is as follows: >

	make main.o

More about these modifiers here: |filename-modifiers|.


OLD ERROR LISTS

Suppose you ":make" a program.  There is a warning message in one file and an
error message in another.  You fix the error and use ":make" again to check if
it was really fixed.  Now you want to look at the warning message.  It doesn't
show up in the last error list, since the file with the warning wasn't
compiled again.  You can go back to the previous error list with: >

	:colder

Then use ":clist" and ":cc {nr}" to jump to the place with the warning.
   To go forward to the next error list: >

	:cnewer

Vim remembers ten error lists.


SWITCHING COMPILERS

You have to tell Vim what format the error messages are that your compiler
produces.  This is done with the 'errorformat' option.  The syntax of this
option is quite complicated and it can be made to fit almost any compiler.
You can find the explanation here: |errorformat|.

You might be using various different compilers.  Setting the 'makeprg' option,
and especially the 'errorformat' each time is not easy.  Vim offers a simple
method for this.  For example, to switch to using the Microsoft Visual C++
compiler: >

	:compiler msvc

This will find the Vim script for the "msvc" compiler and set the appropriate
options.
   You can write your own compiler files.  See |write-compiler-plugin|.


OUTPUT REDIRECTION

The ":make" command redirects the output of the executed program to an error
file.  How this works depends on various things, such as the 'shell'.  If your
":make" command doesn't capture the output, check the 'makeef' and
'shellpipe' options.  The 'shellquote' and 'shellxquote' options might also
matter.

In case you can't get ":make" to redirect the file for you, an alternative is
to compile the program in another window and redirect the output into a file.
Then have Vim read this file with: >

	:cfile {filename}

Jumping to errors will work like with the ":make" command.

==============================================================================
*30.2*	Indenting C style text

A program is much easier to understand when the lines have been properly
indented.  Vim offers various ways to make this less work.  For C or C style
programs like Java or C++, set the 'cindent' option.  Vim knows a lot about C
programs and will try very hard to automatically set the indent for you.  Set
the 'shiftwidth' option to the amount of spaces you want for a deeper level.
Four spaces will work fine.  One ":set" command will do it: >

	:set cindent shiftwidth=4

With this option enabled, when you type something such as "if (x)", the next
line will automatically be indented an additional level.

				    if (flag)
	Automatic indent   --->		do_the_work();
	Automatic unindent <--	    if (other_flag) {
	Automatic indent   --->		do_file();
	keep indent			do_some_more();
	Automatic unindent <--	    }

When you type something in curly braces ({}), the text will be indented at the
start and unindented at the end.  The unindenting will happen after typing the
'}', since Vim can't guess what you are going to type.

One side effect of automatic indentation is that it helps you catch errors in
your code early.  When you type a } to finish a function, only to find that
the automatic indentation gives it more indent than what you expected, there
is probably a } missing.  Use the "%" command to find out which { matches the
} you typed.
   A missing ) and ; also cause extra indent.  Thus if you get more white
space than you would expect, check the preceding lines.

When you have code that is badly formatted, or you inserted and deleted lines,
you need to re-indent the lines.  The "=" operator does this.  The simplest
form is: >

	==

This indents the current line.  Like with all operators, there are three ways
to use it.  In Visual mode "=" indents the selected lines.  A useful text
object is "a{".  This selects the current {} block.  Thus, to re-indent the
code block the cursor is in: >

	=a{

I you have really badly indented code, you can re-indent the whole file with:
>
	gg=G

However, don't do this in files that have been carefully indented manually.
The automatic indenting does a good job, but in some situations you might want
to overrule it.


SETTING INDENT STYLE

Different people have different styles of indentation.  By default Vim does a
pretty good job of indenting in a way that 90% of programmers do.  There are
different styles, however; so if you want to, you can customize the
indentation style with the 'cinoptions' option.
   By default 'cinoptions' is empty and Vim uses the default style.  You can
add various items where you want something different.  For example, to make
curly braces be placed like this:

	if (flag) ~
	  { ~
	    i = 8; ~
	    j = 0; ~
	  } ~

Use this command: >

	:set cinoptions+={2

There are many of these items.  See |cinoptions-values|.

==============================================================================
*30.3*	Automatic indenting

You don't want to switch on the 'cindent' option manually every time you edit
a C file.  This is how you make it work automatically: >

	:filetype indent on

Actually, this does a lot more than switching on 'cindent' for C files.  First
of all, it enables detecting the type of a file.  That's the same as what is
used for syntax highlighting.
   When the filetype is known, Vim will search for an indent file for this
type of file.  The Vim distribution includes a number of these for various
programming languages.  This indent file will then prepare for automatic
indenting specifically for this file.

If you don't like the automatic indenting, you can switch it off again: >

	:filetype indent off

If you don't like the indenting for one specific type of file, this is how you
avoid it.  Create a file with just this one line: >

	:let b:did_indent = 1

Now you need to write this in a file with a specific name:

	{directory}/indent/{filetype}.vim

The {filetype} is the name of the file type, such as "cpp" or "java".  You can
see the exact name that Vim detected with this command: >

	:set filetype

In this file the output is:

	filetype=help ~

Thus you would use "help" for {filetype}.
   For the {directory} part you need to use your runtime directory.  Look at
the output of this command: >

	set runtimepath

Now use the first item, the name before the first comma.  Thus if the output
looks like this:

	runtimepath=~/.vim,/usr/local/share/vim/vim60/runtime,~/.vim/after ~

You use "~/.vim" for {directory}.  Then the resulting file name is:

	~/.vim/indent/help.vim ~

Instead of switching the indenting off, you could write your own indent file.
How to do that is explained here: |indent-expression|.

==============================================================================
*30.4*	Other indenting

The most simple form of automatic indenting is with the 'autoindent' option.
It uses the indent from the previous line.  A bit smarter is the 'smartindent'
option.  This is useful for languages where no indent file is available.
'smartindent' is not as smart as 'cindent', but smarter than 'autoindent'.
   With 'smartindent' set, an extra level of indentation is added for each {
and removed for each }.  An extra level of indentation will also be added for
any of the words in the 'cinwords' option.  Lines that begin with # are
treated specially: all indentation is removed.  This is done so that
preprocessor directives will all start in column 1.  The indentation is
restored for the next line.


CORRECTING INDENTS

When you are using 'autoindent' or 'smartindent' to get the indent of the
previous line, there will be many times when you need to add or remove one
'shiftwidth' worth of indent.  A quick way to do this is using the CTRL-D and
CTRL-T commands in Insert mode.
   For example, you are typing a shell script that is supposed to look like
this:

	if test -n a; then ~
	   echo a ~
	   echo "-------" ~
	fi ~

Start off by setting these options: >

	:set autoindent shiftwidth=3

You start by typing the first line, <Enter> and the start of the second line:

	if test -n a; then ~
	echo ~

Now you see that you need an extra indent.  Type CTRL-T.  The result:

	if test -n a; then ~
	   echo ~

The CTRL-T command, in Insert mode, adds one 'shiftwidth' to the indent, no
matter where in the line you are.
   You continue typing the second line, <Enter> and the third line.  This time
the indent is OK.  Then <Enter> and the last line.  Now you have this:

	if test -n a; then ~
	   echo a ~
	   echo "-------" ~
	   fi ~

To remove the superfluous indent in the last line press CTRL-D.  This deletes
one 'shiftwidth' worth of indent, no matter where you are in the line.
   When you are in Normal mode, you can use the ">>" and "<<" commands to
shift lines.  ">" and "<" are operators, thus you have the usual three ways to
specify the lines you want to indent.  A useful combination is: >

	>i{

This adds one indent to the current block of lines, inside {}.  The { and }
lines themselves are left unmodified.  ">a{" includes them.  In this example
the cursor is on "printf":

	original text		after ">i{"		after ">a{"

	if (flag)		if (flag)		if (flag) ~
	{			{			    { ~
	printf("yes");		    printf("yes");	    printf("yes"); ~
	flag = 0;		    flag = 0;		    flag = 0;  ~
	}			}			    } ~

==============================================================================
*30.5*	Tabs and spaces

'tabstop' is set to eight by default.  Although you can change it, you quickly
run into trouble later.  Other programs won't know what tabstop value you
used.  They probably use the default value of eight, and your text suddenly
looks very different.  Also, most printers use a fixed tabstop value of eight.
Thus it's best to keep 'tabstop' alone.  (If you edit a file which was written
with a different tabstop setting, see |25.3| for how to fix that.)
   For indenting lines in a program, using a multiple of eight spaces makes
you quickly run into the right border of the window.  Using a single space
doesn't provide enough visual difference.  Many people prefer to use four
spaces, a good compromise.
   Since a <Tab> is eight spaces and you want to use an indent of four spaces,
you can't use a <Tab> character to make your indent.  There are two ways to
handle this:

1.  Use a mix of <Tab> and space characters.  Since a <Tab> takes the place of
    eight spaces, you have fewer characters in your file.  Inserting a <Tab>
    is quicker than eight spaces.  Backspacing works faster as well.

2.  Use spaces only.  This avoids the trouble with programs that use a
    different tabstop value.

Fortunately, Vim supports both methods quite well.


SPACES AND TABS

If you are using a combination of tabs and spaces, you just edit normally.
The Vim defaults do a fine job of handling things.
   You can make life a little easier by setting the 'softtabstop' option.
This option tells Vim to make the <Tab> key look and feel as if tabs were set
at the value of 'softtabstop', but actually use a combination of tabs and
spaces.
   After you execute the following command, every time you press the <Tab> key
the cursor moves to the next 4-column boundary: >

	:set softtabstop=4

When you start in the first column and press <Tab>, you get 4 spaces inserted
in your text.  The second time, Vim takes out the 4 spaces and puts in a <Tab>
(thus taking you to column 8).  Thus Vim uses as many <Tab>s as possible, and
then fills up with spaces.
   When backspacing it works the other way around.  A <BS> will always delete
the amount specified with 'softtabstop'.  Then <Tab>s are used as many as
possible and spaces to fill the gap.
   The following shows what happens pressing <Tab> a few times, and then using
<BS>.  A "." stands for a space and "------->" for a <Tab>.

	type			  result ~
	<Tab>			  ....
	<Tab><Tab>		  ------->
	<Tab><Tab><Tab>		  ------->....
	<Tab><Tab><Tab><BS>	  ------->
	<Tab><Tab><Tab><BS><BS>   ....

An alternative is to use the 'smarttab' option.  When it's set, Vim uses
'shiftwidth' for a <Tab> typed in the indent of a line, and a real <Tab> when
typed after the first non-blank character.  However, <BS> doesn't work like
with 'softtabstop'.


JUST SPACES

If you want absolutely no tabs in your file, you can set the 'expandtab'
option: >

	:set expandtab

When this option is set, the <Tab> key inserts a series of spaces.  Thus you
get the same amount of white space as if a <Tab> character was inserted, but
there isn't a real <Tab> character in your file.
   The backspace key will delete each space by itself.  Thus after typing one
<Tab> you have to press the <BS> key up to eight times to undo it.  If you are
in the indent, pressing CTRL-D will be a lot quicker.


CHANGING TABS IN SPACES (AND BACK)

Setting 'expandtab' does not affect any existing tabs.  In other words, any
tabs in the document remain tabs.  If you want to convert tabs to spaces, use
the ":retab" command.  Use these commands: >

	:set expandtab
	:%retab

Now Vim will have changed all indents to use spaces instead of tabs.  However,
all tabs that come after a non-blank character are kept.  If you want these to
be converted as well, add a !: >

	:%retab!

This is a little bit dangerous, because it can also change tabs inside a
string.  To check if these exist, you could use this: >

	/"[^"\t]*\t[^"]*"

It's recommended not to use hard tabs inside a string.  Replace them with
"\t" to avoid trouble.

The other way around works just as well: >

	:set noexpandtab
	:%retab!

==============================================================================
*30.6*	Formatting comments

One of the great things about Vim is that it understands comments.  You can
ask Vim to format a comment and it will do the right thing.
   Suppose, for example, that you have the following comment:

	/* ~
	 * This is a test ~
	 * of the text formatting. ~
	 */ ~

You then ask Vim to format it by positioning the cursor at the start of the
comment and type: >

	gq]/

"gq" is the operator to format text.  "]/" is the motion that takes you to the
end of a comment.  The result is:

	/* ~
	 * This is a test of the text formatting. ~
	 */ ~

Notice that Vim properly handled the beginning of each line.
  An alternative is to select the text that is to be formatted in Visual mode
and type "gq".

To add a new line to the comment, position the cursor on the middle line and
press "o".  The result looks like this:

	/* ~
	 * This is a test of the text formatting. ~
	 * ~
	 */ ~

Vim has automatically inserted a star and a space for you.  Now you can type
the comment text.  When it gets longer than 'textwidth', Vim will break the
line.  Again, the star is inserted automatically:

	/* ~
	 * This is a test of the text formatting. ~
	 * Typing a lot of text here will make Vim ~
	 * break ~
	 */ ~

For this to work some flags must be present in 'formatoptions':

	r	insert the star when typing <Enter> in Insert mode
	o	insert the star when using "o" or "O" in Normal mode
	c	break comment text according to 'textwidth'

See |fo-table| for more flags.


DEFINING A COMMENT

The 'comments' option defines what a comment looks like.  Vim distinguishes
between a single-line comment and a comment that has a different start, end
and middle part.
   Many single-line comments start with a specific character.  In C++ // is
used, in Makefiles #, in Vim scripts ".  For example, to make Vim understand
C++ comments: >

	:set comments=://

The colon separates the flags of an item from the text by which the comment is
recognized.  The general form of an item in 'comments' is:

	{flags}:{text}

The {flags} part can be empty, as in this case.
   Several of these items can be concatenated, separated by commas.  This
allows recognizing different types of comments at the same time.  For example,
let's edit an e-mail message.  When replying, the text that others wrote is
preceded with ">" and "!" characters.  This command would work: >

	:set comments=n:>,n:!

There are two items, one for comments starting with ">" and one for comments
that start with "!".  Both use the flag "n".  This means that these comments
nest.  Thus a line starting with ">" may have another comment after the ">".
This allows formatting a message like this:

	> ! Did you see that site? ~
	> ! It looks really great. ~
	> I don't like it.  The ~
	> colors are terrible. ~
	What is the URL of that ~
	site? ~

Try setting 'textwidth' to a different value, e.g., 80, and format the text by
Visually selecting it and typing "gq".  The result is:

	> ! Did you see that site?  It looks really great. ~
	> I don't like it.  The colors are terrible. ~
	What is the URL of that site? ~

You will notice that Vim did not move text from one type of comment to
another.  The "I" in the second line would have fit at the end of the first
line, but since that line starts with "> !" and the second line with ">", Vim
knows that this is a different kind of comment.


A THREE PART COMMENT

A C comment starts with "/*", has "*" in the middle and "*/" at the end.  The
entry in 'comments' for this looks like this: >

	:set comments=s1:/*,mb:*,ex:*/

The start is defined with "s1:/*".  The "s" indicates the start of a
three-piece comment.  The colon separates the flags from the text by which the
comment is recognized: "/*".  There is one flag: "1".  This tells Vim that the
middle part has an offset of one space.
   The middle part "mb:*" starts with "m", which indicates it is a middle
part.  The "b" flag means that a blank must follow the text.  Otherwise Vim
would consider text like "*pointer" also to be the middle of a comment.
   The end part "ex:*/" has the "e" for identification.  The "x" flag has a
special meaning.  It means that after Vim automatically inserted a star,
typing / will remove the extra space.

{Vi does not have a Windows GUI}

==============================================================================
1. Starting the GUI					*gui-w32-start*

The Win32 GUI version of Vim will always start the GUI, no matter how you
start it or what it's called.

The GUI will always run in the Windows subsystem.  Mostly shells automatically
return with a command prompt after starting gvim.  If not, you should use the
"start" command: >
	start gvim [options] file ..

Note: All fonts (bold, italic) must be of the same size!!!  If you don't do
this, text will disappear or mess up the display.  Vim does not check the font
sizes.  It's the size in screen pixels that must be the same.  Note that some
fonts that have the same point size don't have the same pixel size!
Additionally, the positioning of the fonts must be the same (ascent and
descent).

The Win32 GUI has an extra menu item:  "Edit/Select Font".  It brings up the
standard Windows font selector.

Setting the menu height doesn't work for the Win32 GUI.

							*gui-win32-maximized*
If you want Vim to start with a maximized window, add this command to your
vimrc or gvimrc file: >
	au GUIEnter * simalt ~x
<
								*gui-w32s*
There is a specific version of gvim.exe that runs under the Win32s subsystem
of Windows 3.1 or 3.11.  See |win32s|.


Using Vim as a plugin					*gui-w32-windowid*

When gvim starts up normally, it creates its own top level window.  If you
pass Vim the command-line option |--windowid| with a decimal or hexadecimal
value, Vim will create a window that is a child of the window with the given
ID.  This enables Vim to act as a plugin in another application.  This really
is a programmer's interface, and is of no use without a supporting application
to spawn Vim correctly.

==============================================================================
2. Vim as default editor				*vim-default-editor*

To set Vim as the default editor for a file type:
1. Start a Windows Explorer
2. Choose View/Options -> File Types
3. Select the path to gvim for every file type that you want to use it for.
   (you can also use three spaces in the file type field, for files without an
   extension).
   In the "open" action, use: >
	gvim "%1"
<  The quotes are required for using file names with embedded spaces.
   You can also use this: >
	gvim "%L"
<  This should avoid short (8.3 character) file names in some situations.  But
   I'm not sure if this works everywhere.

When you open a file in Vim by double clicking it, Vim changes to that
file's directory.

If you want Vim to start full-screen, use this for the Open action: >
	gvim -c "simalt ~x" "%1"

Another method, which also works when you put Vim in another directory (e.g.,
when you have got a new version):
1. select a file you want to use Vim with
2. <Shift-F10>
3. select "Open With..." menu entry
4. click "Other..."
5. browse to the (new) location of Vim and click "Open"
6. make "Always Use this program..." checked
7. <OK>

						*send-to-menu* *sendto*
You can also install Vim in the "Send To" menu:
1. Start a Windows Explorer
2. Navigate to your sendto directory:
   Windows 95: %windir%\sendto (e.g. "c:\windows\sendto")
   Windows NT: %windir%\profiles\%user%\sendto (e.g.
	       "c:\winnt\profiles\mattha\sendto").
3. Right-click in the file pane and select New->Shortcut
4. Follow the shortcut wizard, using the full path to VIM/GVIM.

When you 'send a file to Vim', Vim changes to that file's directory.  Note,
however, that any long directory names will appear in their short (MS-DOS)
form.  This is a limitation of the Windows "Send To" mechanism.

						*notepad*
You could replace notepad.exe with gvim.exe, but that has a few side effects.
Some programs rely on notepad arguments, which are not recognized by Vim.  For
example "notepad -p" is used by some applications to print a file.  It's
better to leave notepad where it is and use another way to start Vim.

						*win32-popup-menu*
A more drastic approach is to install an "Edit with Vim" entry in the popup
menu for the right mouse button.  With this you can edit any file with Vim.

This can co-exist with the file associations mentioned above.  The difference
is that the file associations will make starting Vim the default action.  With
the "Edit with Vim" menu entry you can keep the existing file association for
double clicking on the file, and edit the file with Vim when you want.  For
example, you can associate "*.mak" with your make program.  You can execute
the makefile by double clicking it and use the "Edit with Vim" entry to edit
the makefile.

You can select any files and right-click to see a menu option called "Edit
with gvim".  Choosing this menu option will invoke gvim with the file you have
selected.  If you select multiple files, you will find two gvim-related menu
options:
"Edit with multiple gvims"  -- one gvim for each file in the selection
"Edit with single gvim"     -- one gvim for all the files in the selection
And if there already is a gvim running:
"Edit with existing gvim"   -- edit the file with the running gvim

The "edit with existing Vim" entries can be disabled by adding an entry in the
registry under HKLM\Software\Vim\Gvim, named DisableEditWithExisting, and with
any value.
						*install-registry*
You can add the "Edit with Vim" menu entry in an easy way by using the
"install.exe" program.  It will add several registry entries for you.

You can also do this by hand.  This is complicated!  Use the install.exe if
you can.

1. Start the registry editor with "regedit".
2. Add these keys:
   key		value name		    value ~
   HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\CLSID\{51EEE242-AD87-11d3-9C1E-0090278BBD99}
		{default}		    Vim Shell Extension
   HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\CLSID\{51EEE242-AD87-11d3-9C1E-0090278BBD99}\InProcServer32
		{default}		    {path}\gvimext.dll
		ThreadingModel		    Apartment
   HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\*\shellex\ContextMenuHandlers\gvim
		{default}		    {51EEE242-AD87-11d3-9C1E-0090278BBD99}
   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Shell Extensions\Approved
		{51EEE242-AD87-11d3-9C1E-0090278BBD99}
					    Vim Shell Extension
   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Vim\Gvim
		path			    {path}\gvim.exe
   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Uninstall\vim 5.6
		DisplayName		    Vim 5.6: Edit with Vim popup menu entry
		UninstallString		    {path}\uninstal.exe

   Replace {path} with the path that leads to the executable.
   Don't type {default}, this is the value for the key itself.

To remove "Edit with Vim" from the popup menu, just remove the registry
entries mentioned above.  The "uninstal.exe" program can do this for you.  You
can also use the entry in the Windows standard "Add/Remove Programs" list.

If you notice that this entry overrules other file type associations, set
those associations again by hand (using Windows Explorer, see above).  This
only seems to happen on some Windows NT versions (Windows bug?).  Procedure:
1. Find the name of the file type.  This can be done by starting the registry
   editor, and searching for the extension in \\HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT
2. In a Windows Explorer, use View/Options/File Types.  Search for the file
   type in the list and click "Edit".  In the actions list, you can select on
   to be used as the default (normally the "open" action) and click on the
   "Set Default" button.


Vim in the "Open With..." context menu			*win32-open-with-menu*

If you use the Vim install program you have the choice to add Vim to the "Open
With..." menu.  This means you can use Vim to edit many files.  Not every file
(for unclear reasons...), thus the "Edit with Vim" menu entry is still useful.

One reason to add this is to be able to edit HTML files directly from Internet
Explorer.  To enable this use the "Tools" menu, "Internet Options..." entry.
In the dialog select the "Programs" tab and select Vim in the "HTML editor"
choice.  If it's not there than installing didn't work properly.

Doing this manually can be done with this script:

----------------------------------------------------------
REGEDIT4

[HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\Applications\gvim.exe]

[HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\Applications\gvim.exe\shell]

[HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\Applications\gvim.exe\shell\edit]

[HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\Applications\gvim.exe\shell\edit\command]
@="c:\\vim\\vim62\\gvim.exe \"%1\""

[HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\.htm\OpenWithList\gvim.exe]

[HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\*\OpenWithList\gvim.exe]

----------------------------------------------------------

Change the "c:\\vim\\vim62" bit to where gvim.exe is actually located.

To uninstall this run the Vim uninstall program or manually delete the
registry entries with "regedit".

==============================================================================
3. Using the clipboard					*gui-clipboard*

Windows has a clipboard, where you can copy text to, and paste text from.  Vim
supports this in several ways.  For other systems see |gui-selections|.

The "* register reflects the contents of the clipboard.  |quotestar|

When the "unnamed" string is included in the 'clipboard' option, the unnamed
register is the same.  Thus you can yank to and paste from the clipboard
without prepending "* to commands.

The 'a' flag in 'guioptions' is not included by default.  This means that text
is only put on the clipboard when an operation is performed on it.  Just
Visually selecting text doesn't put it on the clipboard.  When the 'a' flag is
included, the text is copied to the clipboard even when it is not operated
upon.

							*mswin.vim*
To use the standard MS-Windows way of CTRL-X, CTRL-C and CTRL-V, use the
$VIMRUNTIME/mswin.vim script.  You could add this line to your _vimrc file: >
	source $VIMRUNTIME/mswin.vim

Since CTRL-C is used to copy the text to the clipboard, it can't be used to
cancel an operation.  Use CTRL-Break for that.

CTRL-Z is used for undo.  This means you can't suspend Vim with this key, use
|:suspend| instead (if it's supported at all).

						*CTRL-V-alternative* *CTRL-Q*
Since CTRL-V is used to paste, you can't use it to start a blockwise Visual
selection.  You can use CTRL-Q instead.  You can also use CTRL-Q in Insert
mode and Command-line mode to get the old meaning of CTRL-V.  But CTRL-Q
doesn't work for terminals when it's used for control flow.

NOTE: The clipboard support still has a number of bugs.  See |todo|.

==============================================================================
4. Shell Commands					*gui-shell-win32*

Vim uses another window for external commands, to make it possible to run any
command.  The external command gets its own environment for running, just like
it was started from a DOS prompt.

							*win32-vimrun*
Executing an external command is done indirectly by the "vimrun" command.  The
"vimrun.exe" must be in the path for this to work.  Or it must be in the same
directory as the Vim executable.  If "vimrun" cannot be found, the command is
executed directly, but then the DOS window closes immediately after the
external command has finished.
WARNING: If you close this window with the "X" button, and confirm the
question if you really want to kill the application, Vim may be killed too!
(This does not apply to commands run asynchronously with ":!start".)

In Windows 95, the window in which the commands are executed is always 25x80
characters, to be as DOS compatible as possible (this matters!).  The default
system font is used.  On NT, the window will be the default you have set up for
"Console" in Control Panel.  On Win32s, the properties of the DOS box are
determined by _default.pif in the windows directory.

							*msdos-mode*
If you get a dialog that says "This program is set to run in MS-DOS mode..."
when you run an external program, you can solve this by changing the
properties of the associated shortcut:
- Use a Windows Explorer to find the command.com that is used.  It can be
  c:\command.com, c:\dos\command.com, c:\windows\command.com, etc.
- With the right mouse button, select properties of this command.com.
- In the Program tab select "Advanced".
- Unselect "MS-DOS mode".
- Click "OK" twice.

							*win32-!start*
Normally, Vim waits for a command to complete before continuing (this makes
sense for most shell commands which produce output for Vim to use).  If you
want Vim to start a program and return immediately, you can use the following
syntax on W95 & NT: >
	:!start [/min] {command}
The optional "/min" causes the window to be minimized.

On Win32s, you will have to go to another window instead.  Don't forget that
you must tell Windows 3.1x to keep executing a DOS command in the background
while you switch back to Vim.

==============================================================================
5. Special colors					*win32-colors*

On Win32, the normal DOS colors can be used.  See |dos-colors|.

Additionally the system configured colors can also be used.  These are known
by the names Sys_XXX, where XXX is the appropriate system color name, from the
following list (see the Win32 documentation for full descriptions).  Case is
ignored.  Note: On Win32s not all of these colors are supported.

Sys_3DDKShadow		Sys_3DFace			Sys_BTNFace
Sys_3DHilight		Sys_3DHighlight			Sys_BTNHilight
Sys_BTNHighlight	Sys_3DLight			Sys_3DShadow
Sys_BTNShadow		Sys_ActiveBorder		Sys_ActiveCaption
Sys_AppWorkspace	Sys_Background			Sys_Desktop
Sys_BTNText		Sys_CaptionText			Sys_GrayText
Sys_Highlight		Sys_HighlightText		Sys_InactiveBorder
Sys_InactiveCaption	Sys_InactiveCaptionText		Sys_InfoBK
Sys_InfoText		Sys_Menu			Sys_MenuText
Sys_ScrollBar		Sys_Window			Sys_WindowFrame
Sys_WindowText

Probably the most useful values are
	Sys_Window	    Normal window background
	Sys_WindowText      Normal window text
	Sys_Highlight       Highlighted background
	Sys_HighlightText   Highlighted text

These extra colors are also available:
Gray, Grey, LightYellow, SeaGreen, Orange, Purple, SlateBlue, Violet,

								*rgb.txt*
Additionally, colors defined by a "rgb.txt" file can be used.  This file is
well known from X11.  A few lines from it: >

  255 218 185		   peach puff
  205 133  63		   peru
  255 181 197		   pink

This shows the layout of the file:  First the R, G and B value as a decimal
number, followed by the name of the color.  The four fields are separated by
spaces.

You can get an rgb.txt file from any X11 distribution.  It is located in a
directory like "/usr/X11R6/lib/X11/".  For Vim it must be located in the
$VIMRUNTIME directory.  Thus the file can be found with "$VIMRUNTIME/rgb.txt".

==============================================================================
						*gui-w32-dialogs* *dialog*
6. Windows dialogs & browsers

The Win32 GUI can use familiar Windows components for some operations, as well
as the traditional interface shared with the console version.


6.1 Dialogs

The dialogs displayed by the "confirm" family (i.e. the 'confirm' option,
|:confirm| command and |confirm()| function) are GUI-based rather than the
console-based ones used by other versions.  The 'c' flag in 'guioptions'
changes this.


6.2 File Browsers

When prepending ":browse" before file editing commands, a file requester is
used to allow you to select an existing file.  See |:browse|.


6.3 Tearoff Menus

The Win32 GUI emulates Motif's tear-off menus.  At the top of each menu you
will see a small graphic "rip here" sign.  Selecting it will cause a floating
window to be created with the same menu entries on it.  The floating menu can
then be accessed just as if it was the original (including sub-menus), but
without having to go to the menu bar each time.
This is most useful if you find yourself using a command buried in a sub-menu
over and over again.
The tearoff menus can be positioned where you like, and always stay just above
the Main Vim window.  You can get rid of them by closing them as usual; they
also of course close when you exit Vim.

							*:tearoff* *:te*
:te[aroff] {name}	Tear-off the menu {name}.  The menu named must have at
			least one subentry, but need not appear on the
			menu-bar (see |win32-hidden-menus|).

Example: >
	:tearoff File
will make the "File" menu (if there is one) appear as a tearoff menu. >

	:amenu ]Toolbar.Make	:make<CR>
	:tearoff ]Toolbar
This creates a floating menu that doesn't exist on the main menu-bar.

Note that a menu that starts with ']' will not be displayed.

==============================================================================
7. Command line arguments				*gui-w32-cmdargs*

Analysis of a command line into parameters is not standardised in MS Windows.
Gvim has to provide logic to analyse a command line.  This logic is likely to
be different from the default logic provided by a compilation system used to
build vim.  The differences relate to unusual double quote (") usage.
The arguments "C:\My Music\freude.txt" and "+/Sch\"iller" are handled in the
same way.  The argument "+/Sch""iller" may be handled different by gvim and
vim, depending what it was compiled with.

The rules are:
      a) A parameter is a sequence of graphic characters.
      b) Parameters are separated by white space.
      c) A parameter can be enclosed in double quotes to include white space.
      d) A sequence of zero or more backslashes (\) and a double quote (")
	is special.  The effective number of backslashes is halved, rounded
	down.  An even number of backslashes reverses the acceptability of
	spaces and tabs, an odd number of backslashes produces a literal
	double quote.

So:
	"	is a special double quote
	\"	is a literal double quote
	\\"	is a literal backslash and a special double quote
	\\\"	is a literal backslash and a literal double quote
	\\\\"	is 2 literal backslashes and a special double quote
	\\\\\"	is 2 literal backslashes and a literal double quote
	etc.

Example: >
	gvim "C:\My Music\freude" +"set ignorecase" +/"\"foo\\" +\"bar\\\"

opens "C:\My Music\freude" and executes the line mode commands: >
	set ignorecase; /"foo\ and /bar\"

==============================================================================
8. Various						*gui-w32-various*

							*gui-w32-printing*
The "File/Print" menu prints the text with syntax highlighting, see
|:hardcopy|.  If you just want to print the raw text and have a default
printer installed this should also work: >
	:w >>prn

Vim supports a number of standard MS Windows features.  Some of these are
detailed elsewhere: see |'mouse'|, |win32-hidden-menus|.

							*drag-n-drop-win32*
You can drag and drop one or more files into the Vim window, where they will
be opened as normal.  See |drag-n-drop|.

							*:simalt* *:si*
:sim[alt] {key}		simulate pressing {key} while holding Alt pressed.
			{not in Vi} {only for Win32 versions}

Normally, Vim takes control of all Alt-<Key> combinations, to increase the
number of possible mappings.  This clashes with the standard use of Alt as the
key for accessing menus.
The quick way of getting standard behavior is to set the 'winaltkeys' option
to "yes".  This however prevents you from mapping Alt keys at all.
Another way is to set 'winaltkeys' to "menu".  Menu shortcut keys are then
handled by windows, other ALT keys can be mapped.  This doesn't allow a
dependency on the current state though.
To get round this, the :simalt command allows Vim (when 'winaltkeys' is not
"yes") to fake a Windows-style Alt keypress.  You can use this to map Alt key
combinations (or anything else for that matter) to produce standard Windows
actions.  Here are some examples: >

	:map <M-f> :simalt f<CR>
This makes Alt-F pop down the 'File' menu (with the stock Menu.vim) by
simulating the keystrokes Alt, F. >
	:map <M-Space> :simalt ~<CR>
This maps Alt-Space to pop down the system menu for the Vim window.  Note that
~ is used by simalt to represent the <Space> character. >
	:map <C-n> :simalt ~n<CR>
Maps Control-N to produce the keys Alt-Space followed by N.  This minimizes the
Vim window via the system menu.

Note that the key changes depending on the language you are using.

						*intellimouse-wheel-problems*
When using the Intellimouse mouse wheel causes Vim to stop accepting input, go
to:
	ControlPanel - Mouse - Wheel - UniversalScrolling - Exceptions

And add gvim to the list of applications.  This problem only appears to happen
with the Intellimouse driver 2.2 and when "Universal Scrolling" is turned on.


XPM support						*w32-xpm-support*

Gvim can be build on MS-Windows with support for XPM files.  |+xpm_w32|
See the Make_mvc.mak file for instructions, search for XPM.

To try out if XPM support works do this: >
	:help
	:exe 'sign define vimxpm icon=' . $VIMRUNTIME . '\\vim16x16.xpm'
	:exe 'sign place 1 line=1 name=vimxpm file=' . expand('%:p')

				   Folding


Structured text can be separated in sections.  And sections in sub-sections.
Folding allows you to display a section as one line, providing an overview.
This chapter explains the different ways this can be done.

 Previous chapter: |usr_27.txt|  Search commands and patterns
Table of contents: |usr_toc.txt|

==============================================================================
*28.1*	What is folding?

Folding is used to show a range of lines in the buffer as a single line on the
screen.  Like a piece of paper which is folded to make it shorter:

	+------------------------+
	| line 1		 |
	| line 2		 |
	| line 3		 |
	|_______________________ |
	\			 \
	 \________________________\
	 / folded lines		  /
	/________________________/
	| line 12		 |
	| line 13		 |
	| line 14		 |
	+------------------------+

The text is still in the buffer, unchanged.  Only the way lines are displayed
is affected by folding.

The advantage of folding is that you can get a better overview of the
structure of text, by folding lines of a section and replacing it with a line
that indicates that there is a section.

==============================================================================
*28.2*	Manual folding

Try it out: Position the cursor in a paragraph and type: >

	zfap

You will see that the paragraph is replaced by a highlighted line.  You have
created a fold.  |zf| is an operator and |ap| a text object selection.  You
can use the |zf| operator with any movement command to create a fold for the
text that it moved over.  |zf| also works in Visual mode.

To view the text again, open the fold by typing: >

	zo

And you can close the fold again with: >

	zc

All the folding commands start with "z".  With some fantasy, this looks like a
folded piece of paper, seen from the side.  The letter after the "z" has a
mnemonic meaning to make it easier to remember the commands:

	zf	F-old creation
	zo	O-pen a fold
	zc	C-lose a fold

Folds can be nested: A region of text that contains folds can be folded
again.  For example, you can fold each paragraph in this section, and then
fold all the sections in this chapter.  Try it out.  You will notice that
opening the fold for the whole chapter will restore the nested folds as they
were, some may be open and some may be closed.

Suppose you have created several folds, and now want to view all the text.
You could go to each fold and type "zo".  To do this faster, use this command: >

	zr

This will R-educe the folding.  The opposite is: >

	zm

This folds M-ore.  You can repeat "zr" and "zm" to open and close nested folds
of several levels.

If you have nested several levels deep, you can open all of them with: >

	zR

This R-educes folds until there are none left.  And you can close all folds
with: >

	zM

This folds M-ore and M-ore.

You can quickly disable the folding with the |zn| command.  Then |zN| brings
back the folding as it was.  |zi| toggles between the two.  This is a useful
way of working:
- create folds to get overview on your file
- move around to where you want to do your work
- do |zi| to look at the text and edit it
- do |zi| again to go back to moving around

More about manual folding in the reference manual: |fold-manual|

==============================================================================
*28.3*	Working with folds

When some folds are closed, movement commands like "j" and "k" move over a
fold like it was a single, empty line.  This allows you to quickly move around
over folded text.

You can yank, delete and put folds as if it was a single line.  This is very
useful if you want to reorder functions in a program.  First make sure that
each fold contains a whole function (or a bit less) by selecting the right
'foldmethod'.  Then delete the function with "dd", move the cursor and put it
with "p".  If some lines of the function are above or below the fold, you can
use Visual selection:
- put the cursor on the first line to be moved
- hit "V" to start Visual mode
- put the cursor on the last line to be moved
- hit "d" to delete the selected lines.
- move the cursor to the new position and "p"ut the lines there.

It is sometimes difficult to see or remember where a fold is located, thus
where a |zo| command would actually work.  To see the defined folds: >

	:set foldcolumn=4

This will show a small column on the left of the window to indicate folds.
A "+" is shown for a closed fold.  A "-" is shown at the start of each open
fold and "|" at following lines of the fold.

You can use the mouse to open a fold by clicking on the "+" in the foldcolumn.
Clicking on the "-" or a "|" below it will close an open fold.

To open all folds at the cursor line use |zO|.
To close all folds at the cursor line use |zC|.
To delete a fold at the cursor line use |zd|.
To delete all folds at the cursor line use |zD|.

When in Insert mode, the fold at the cursor line is never closed.  That allows
you to see what you type!

Folds are opened automatically when jumping around or moving the cursor left
or right.  For example, the "0" command opens the fold under the cursor
(if 'foldopen' contains "hor", which is the default).  The 'foldopen' option
can be changed to open folds for specific commands.  If you want the line
under the cursor always to be open, do this: >

	:set foldopen=all

Warning: You won't be able to move onto a closed fold then.  You might want to
use this only temporarily and then set it back to the default: >

	:set foldopen&

You can make folds close automatically when you move out of it: >

	:set foldclose=all

This will re-apply 'foldlevel' to all folds that don't contain the cursor.
You have to try it out if you like how this feels.  Use |zm| to fold more and
|zr| to fold less (reduce folds).

The folding is local to the window.  This allows you to open two windows on
the same buffer, one with folds and one without folds.  Or one with all folds
closed and one with all folds open.

==============================================================================
*28.4*	Saving and restoring folds

When you abandon a file (starting to edit another one), the state of the folds
is lost.  If you come back to the same file later, all manually opened and
closed folds are back to their default.  When folds have been created
manually, all folds are gone!  To save the folds use the |:mkview| command: >

	:mkview

This will store the settings and other things that influence the view on the
file.  You can change what is stored with the 'viewoptions' option.
When you come back to the same file later, you can load the view again: >

	:loadview

You can store up to ten views on one file.  For example, to save the current
setup as the third view and load the second view: >

	:mkview 3
	:loadview 2

Note that when you insert or delete lines the views might become invalid.
Also check out the 'viewdir' option, which specifies where the views are
stored.  You might want to delete old views now and then.

==============================================================================
*28.5*	Folding by indent

Defining folds with |zf| is a lot of work.  If your text is structured by
giving lower level items a larger indent, you can use the indent folding
method.  This will create folds for every sequence of lines with the same
indent.  Lines with a larger indent will become nested folds.  This works well
with many programming languages.

Try this by setting the 'foldmethod' option: >

	:set foldmethod=indent

Then you can use the |zm| and |zr| commands to fold more and reduce folding.
It's easy to see on this example text:

This line is not indented
	This line is indented once
		This line is indented twice
		This line is indented twice
	This line is indented once
This line is not indented
	This line is indented once
	This line is indented once

Note that the relation between the amount of indent and the fold depth depends
on the 'shiftwidth' option.  Each 'shiftwidth' worth of indent adds one to the
depth of the fold.  This is called a fold level.

When you use the |zr| and |zm| commands you actually increase or decrease the
'foldlevel' option.  You could also set it directly: >

	:set foldlevel=3

This means that all folds with three times a 'shiftwidth' indent or more will
be closed.  The lower the foldlevel, the more folds will be closed.  When
'foldlevel' is zero, all folds are closed.  |zM| does set 'foldlevel' to zero.
The opposite command |zR| sets 'foldlevel' to the deepest fold level that is
present in the file.

Thus there are two ways to open and close the folds:
(A) By setting the fold level.
    This gives a very quick way of "zooming out" to view the structure of the
    text, move the cursor, and "zoom in" on the text again.

(B) By using |zo| and |zc| commands to open or close specific folds.
    This allows opening only those folds that you want to be open, while other
    folds remain closed.

This can be combined: You can first close most folds by using |zm| a few times
and then open a specific fold with |zo|.  Or open all folds with |zR| and
then close specific folds with |zc|.

But you cannot manually define folds when 'foldmethod' is "indent", as that
would conflict with the relation between the indent and the fold level.

More about folding by indent in the reference manual: |fold-indent|

==============================================================================
*28.6*	Folding with markers

Markers in the text are used to specify the start and end of a fold region.
This gives precise control over which lines are included in a fold.  The
disadvantage is that the text needs to be modified.

Try it: >

	:set foldmethod=marker

Example text, as it could appear in a C program:

	/* foobar () {{{ */
	int foobar()
	{
		/* return a value {{{ */
		return 42;
		/* }}} */
	}
	/* }}} */

Notice that the folded line will display the text before the marker.  This is
very useful to tell what the fold contains.

It's quite annoying when the markers don't pair up correctly after moving some
lines around.  This can be avoided by using numbered markers.  Example:

	/* global variables {{{1 */
	int varA, varB;

	/* functions {{{1 */
	/* funcA() {{{2 */
	void funcA() {}

	/* funcB() {{{2 */
	void funcB() {}
	/* }}}1 */

At every numbered marker a fold at the specified level begins.  This will make
any fold at a higher level stop here.  You can just use numbered start markers
to define all folds.  Only when you want to explicitly stop a fold before
another starts you need to add an end marker.

More about folding with markers in the reference manual: |fold-marker|

==============================================================================
*28.7*	Folding by syntax

For each language Vim uses a different syntax file.  This defines the colors
for various items in the file.  If you are reading this in Vim, in a terminal
that supports colors, the colors you see are made with the "help" syntax file.
   In the syntax files it is possible to add syntax items that have the "fold"
argument.  These define a fold region.  This requires writing a syntax file
and adding these items in it.  That's not so easy to do.  But once it's done,
all folding happens automatically.
   Here we'll assume you are using an existing syntax file.  Then there is
nothing more to explain.  You can open and close folds as explained above.
The folds will be created and deleted automatically when you edit the file.

More about folding by syntax in the reference manual: |fold-syntax|

==============================================================================
*28.8*	Folding by expression

This is similar to folding by indent, but instead of using the indent of a
line a user function is called to compute the fold level of a line.  You can
use this for text where something in the text indicates which lines belong
together.  An example is an e-mail message where the quoted text is indicated
by a ">" before the line.  To fold these quotes use this: >

	:set foldmethod=expr
	:set foldexpr=strlen(substitute(substitute(getline(v:lnum),'\\s','',\"g\"),'[^>].*','',''))

You can try it out on this text:

> quoted text he wrote
> quoted text he wrote
> > double quoted text I wrote
> > double quoted text I wrote

Explanation for the 'foldexpr' used in the example (inside out):
   getline(v:lnum)			gets the current line
   substitute(...,'\\s','','g')		removes all white space from the line
   substitute(...,'[^>].*','','')	removes everything after leading '>'s
   strlen(...)				counts the length of the string, which
					is the number of '>'s found

Note that a backslash must be inserted before every space, double quote and
backslash for the ":set" command.  If this confuses you, do >

	:set foldexpr

to check the actual resulting value.  To correct a complicated expression, use
the command-line completion: >

	:set foldexpr=<Tab>

Where <Tab> is a real Tab.  Vim will fill in the previous value, which you can
then edit.

When the expression gets more complicated you should put it in a function and
set 'foldexpr' to call that function.

More about folding by expression in the reference manual: |fold-expr|

==============================================================================
*28.9*	Folding unchanged lines

This is useful when you set the 'diff' option in the same window.  The
|vimdiff| command does this for you.  Example: >

	:setlocal diff foldmethod=diff scrollbind nowrap foldlevel=1

Do this in every window that shows a different version of the same file.  You
will clearly see the differences between the files, while the text that didn't
change is folded.

For more details see |fold-diff|.

==============================================================================
*28.10* Which fold method to use?

All these possibilities make you wonder which method you should choose.
Unfortunately, there is no golden rule.  Here are some hints.

If there is a syntax file with folding for the language you are editing, that
is probably the best choice.  If there isn't one, you might try to write it.
This requires a good knowledge of search patterns.  It's not easy, but when
it's working you will not have to define folds manually.

Typing commands to manually fold regions can be used for unstructured text.
Then use the |:mkview| command to save and restore your folds.

The marker method requires you to change the file.  If you are sharing the
files with other people or you have to meet company standards, you might not
be allowed to add them.
   The main advantage of markers is that you can put them exactly where you
want them.  That avoids that a few lines are missed when you cut and paste
folds.  And you can add a comment about what is contained in the fold.

Folding by indent is something that works in many files, but not always very
well.  Use it when you can't use one of the other methods.  However, it is
very useful for outlining.  Then you specifically use one 'shiftwidth' for
each nesting level.

Folding with expressions can make folds in almost any structured text.  It is
quite simple to specify, especially if the start and end of a fold can easily
be recognized.
   If you use the "expr" method to define folds, but they are not exactly how
you want them, you could switch to the "manual" method.  This will not remove
the defined folds.  Then you can delete or add folds manually.

Spell checking						*spell*

1. Quick start			|spell-quickstart|
2. Remarks on spell checking	|spell-remarks|
3. Generating a spell file	|spell-mkspell|
4. Spell file format		|spell-file-format|

{Vi does not have any of these commands}

Spell checking is not available when the |+syntax| feature has been disabled
at compile time.

Note: There also is a vimspell plugin.  If you have it you can do ":help
vimspell" to find about it.  But you will probably want to get rid of the
plugin and use the 'spell' option instead, it works better.

==============================================================================
1. Quick start					*spell-quickstart* *E756*

This command switches on spell checking: >

	:setlocal spell spelllang=en_us

This switches on the 'spell' option and specifies to check for US English.

The words that are not recognized are highlighted with one of these:
	SpellBad	word not recognized			|hl-SpellBad|
	SpellCap	word not capitalised			|hl-SpellCap|
	SpellRare	rare word				|hl-SpellRare|
	SpellLocal	wrong spelling for selected region	|hl-SpellLocal|

Vim only checks words for spelling, there is no grammar check.

If the 'mousemodel' option is set to "popup" and the cursor is on a badly
spelled word or it is "popup_setpos" and the mouse pointer is on a badly
spelled word, then the popup menu will contain a submenu to replace the bad
word.  Note: this slows down the appearance of the popup menu.  Note for GTK:
don't release the right mouse button until the menu appears, otherwise it
won't work.

To search for the next misspelled word:

							*]s*
]s			Move to next misspelled word after the cursor.
			A count before the command can be used to repeat.
			'wrapscan' applies.

							*[s*
[s			Like "]s" but search backwards, find the misspelled
			word before the cursor.  Doesn't recognize words
			split over two lines, thus may stop at words that are
			not highlighted as bad.  Does not stop at word with
			missing capital at the start of a line.

							*]S*
]S			Like "]s" but only stop at bad words, not at rare
			words or words for another region.

							*[S*
[S			Like "]S" but search backwards.


To add words to your own word list:

							*zg*
zg			Add word under the cursor as a good word to the first
			name in 'spellfile'.  A count may precede the command
			to indicate the entry in 'spellfile' to be used.  A
			count of two uses the second entry.

			In Visual mode the selected characters are added as a
			word (including white space!).
			When the cursor is on text that is marked as badly
			spelled then the marked text is used.
			Otherwise the word under the cursor, separated by
			non-word characters, is used.

			If the word is explicitly marked as bad word in
			another spell file the result is unpredictable.

							*zG*
zG			Like "zg" but add the word to the internal word list
			|internal-wordlist|.

							*zw*
zw			Like "zg" but mark the word as a wrong (bad) word.
			If the word already appears in 'spellfile' it is
			turned into a comment line.  See |spellfile-cleanup|
			for getting rid of those.

							*zW*
zW			Like "zw" but add the word to the internal word list
			|internal-wordlist|.

zuw							*zug* *zuw*
zug			Undo |zw| and |zg|, remove the word from the entry in
			'spellfile'.  Count used as with |zg|.

zuW							*zuG* *zuW*
zuG			Undo |zW| and |zG|, remove the word from the internal
			word list.  Count used as with |zg|.

							*:spe* *:spellgood*
:[count]spe[llgood] {word}
			Add {word} as a good word to 'spellfile', like with
			|zg|.  Without count the first name is used, with a
			count of two the second entry, etc.

:spe[llgood]! {word}	Add {word} as a good word to the internal word list,
			like with |zG|.

							*:spellw* *:spellwrong*
:[count]spellw[rong] {word}
			Add {word} as a wrong (bad) word to 'spellfile', as
			with |zw|.  Without count the first name is used, with
			a count of two the second entry, etc.

:spellw[rong]! {word}	Add {word} as a wrong (bad) word to the internal word
			list, like with |zW|.

:[count]spellu[ndo] {word}				*:spellu* *:spellundo*
			Like |zuw|.  [count] used as with |:spellgood|.

:spellu[ndo]! {word}	Like |zuW|.  [count] used as with |:spellgood|.


After adding a word to 'spellfile' with the above commands its associated
".spl" file will automatically be updated and reloaded.  If you change
'spellfile' manually you need to use the |:mkspell| command.  This sequence of
commands mostly works well: >
	:edit <file in 'spellfile'>
<	(make changes to the spell file) >
	:mkspell! %

More details about the 'spellfile' format below |spell-wordlist-format|.

							*internal-wordlist*
The internal word list is used for all buffers where 'spell' is set.  It is
not stored, it is lost when you exit Vim.  It is also cleared when 'encoding'
is set.


Finding suggestions for bad words:
							*z=*
z=			For the word under/after the cursor suggest correctly
			spelled words.  This also works to find alternatives
			for a word that is not highlighted as a bad word,
			e.g., when the word after it is bad.
			In Visual mode the highlighted text is taken as the
			word to be replaced.
			The results are sorted on similarity to the word being
			replaced.
			This may take a long time.  Hit CTRL-C when you get
			bored.

			If the command is used without a count the
			alternatives are listed and you can enter the number
			of your choice or press <Enter> if you don't want to
			replace.  You can also use the mouse to click on your
			choice (only works if the mouse can be used in Normal
			mode and when there are no line wraps).  Click on the
			first line (the header) to cancel.

			The suggestions listed normally replace a highlighted
			bad word.  Sometimes they include other text, in that
			case the replaced text is also listed after a "<".

			If a count is used that suggestion is used, without
			prompting.  For example, "1z=" always takes the first
			suggestion.

			If 'verbose' is non-zero a score will be displayed
			with the suggestions to indicate the likeliness to the
			badly spelled word (the higher the score the more
			different).
			When a word was replaced the redo command "." will
			repeat the word replacement.  This works like "ciw",
			the good word and <Esc>.  This does NOT work for Thai
			and other languages without spaces between words.

					*:spellr* *:spellrepall* *E752* *E753*
:spellr[epall]		Repeat the replacement done by |z=| for all matches
			with the replaced word in the current window.

In Insert mode, when the cursor is after a badly spelled word, you can use
CTRL-X s to find suggestions.  This works like Insert mode completion.  Use
CTRL-N to use the next suggestion, CTRL-P to go back. |i_CTRL-X_s|

The 'spellsuggest' option influences how the list of suggestions is generated
and sorted.  See |'spellsuggest'|.

The 'spellcapcheck' option is used to check the first word of a sentence
starts with a capital.  This doesn't work for the first word in the file.
When there is a line break right after a sentence the highlighting of the next
line may be postponed.  Use |CTRL-L| when needed.  Also see |set-spc-auto| for
how it can be set automatically when 'spelllang' is set.

Vim counts the number of times a good word is encountered.  This is used to
sort the suggestions: words that have been seen before get a small bonus,
words that have been seen often get a bigger bonus.  The COMMON item in the
affix file can be used to define common words, so that this mechanism also
works in a new or short file |spell-COMMON|.

==============================================================================
2. Remarks on spell checking				*spell-remarks*

PERFORMANCE

Vim does on-the-fly spell checking.  To make this work fast the word list is
loaded in memory.  Thus this uses a lot of memory (1 Mbyte or more).  There
might also be a noticeable delay when the word list is loaded, which happens
when 'spell' is set and when 'spelllang' is set while 'spell' was already set.
To minimize the delay each word list is only loaded once, it is not deleted
when 'spelllang' is made empty or 'spell' is reset.  When 'encoding' is set
all the word lists are reloaded, thus you may notice a delay then too.


REGIONS

A word may be spelled differently in various regions.  For example, English
comes in (at least) these variants:

	en		all regions
	en_au		Australia
	en_ca		Canada
	en_gb		Great Britain
	en_nz		New Zealand
	en_us		USA

Words that are not used in one region but are used in another region are
highlighted with SpellLocal |hl-SpellLocal|.

Always use lowercase letters for the language and region names.

When adding a word with |zg| or another command it's always added for all
regions.  You can change that by manually editing the 'spellfile'.  See
|spell-wordlist-format|.  Note that the regions as specified in the files in
'spellfile' are only used when all entries in 'spelllang' specify the same
region (not counting files specified by their .spl name).

							*spell-german*
Specific exception: For German these special regions are used:
	de		all German words accepted
	de_de		old and new spelling
	de_19		old spelling
	de_20		new spelling
	de_at		Austria
	de_ch		Switzerland

							*spell-russian*
Specific exception: For Russian these special regions are used:
	ru		all Russian words accepted
	ru_ru		"IE" letter spelling
	ru_yo		"YO" letter spelling

							*spell-yiddish*
Yiddish requires using "utf-8" encoding, because of the special characters
used.  If you are using latin1 Vim will use transliterated (romanized) Yiddish
instead.  If you want to use transliterated Yiddish with utf-8 use "yi-tr".
In a table:
	'encoding'	'spelllang'
	utf-8		yi		Yiddish
	latin1		yi		transliterated Yiddish
	utf-8		yi-tr		transliterated Yiddish

							*spell-cjk*
Chinese, Japanese and other East Asian characters are normally marked as
errors, because spell checking of these characters is not supported. If
'spelllang' includes "cjk", these characters are not marked as errors.  This
is useful when editing text with spell checking while some Asian words are
present.


SPELL FILES						*spell-load*

Vim searches for spell files in the "spell" subdirectory of the directories in
'runtimepath'.  The name is: LL.EEE.spl, where:
	LL	the language name
	EEE	the value of 'encoding'

The value for "LL" comes from 'spelllang', but excludes the region name.
Examples:
	'spelllang'	LL ~
	en_us		en
	en-rare		en-rare
	medical_ca	medical

Only the first file is loaded, the one that is first in 'runtimepath'.  If
this succeeds then additionally files with the name LL.EEE.add.spl are loaded.
All the ones that are found are used.

If no spell file is found the |SpellFileMissing| autocommand event is
triggered.  This may trigger the |spellfile.vim| plugin to offer you
downloading the spell file.

Additionally, the files related to the names in 'spellfile' are loaded.  These
are the files that |zg| and |zw| add good and wrong words to.

Exceptions:
- Vim uses "latin1" when 'encoding' is "iso-8859-15".  The euro sign doesn't
  matter for spelling.
- When no spell file for 'encoding' is found "ascii" is tried.  This only
  works for languages where nearly all words are ASCII, such as English.  It
  helps when 'encoding' is not "latin1", such as iso-8859-2, and English text
  is being edited.  For the ".add" files the same name as the found main
  spell file is used.

For example, with these values:
	'runtimepath' is "~/.vim,/usr/share/vim70,~/.vim/after"
	'encoding'    is "iso-8859-2"
	'spelllang'   is "pl"

Vim will look for:
1. ~/.vim/spell/pl.iso-8859-2.spl
2. /usr/share/vim70/spell/pl.iso-8859-2.spl
3. ~/.vim/spell/pl.iso-8859-2.add.spl
4. /usr/share/vim70/spell/pl.iso-8859-2.add.spl
5. ~/.vim/after/spell/pl.iso-8859-2.add.spl

This assumes 1. is not found and 2. is found.

If 'encoding' is "latin1" Vim will look for:
1. ~/.vim/spell/pl.latin1.spl
2. /usr/share/vim70/spell/pl.latin1.spl
3. ~/.vim/after/spell/pl.latin1.spl
4. ~/.vim/spell/pl.ascii.spl
5. /usr/share/vim70/spell/pl.ascii.spl
6. ~/.vim/after/spell/pl.ascii.spl

This assumes none of them are found (Polish doesn't make sense when leaving
out the non-ASCII characters).

Spelling for EBCDIC is currently not supported.

A spell file might not be available in the current 'encoding'.  See
|spell-mkspell| about how to create a spell file.  Converting a spell file
with "iconv" will NOT work!

Note: on VMS ".{enc}.spl" is changed to "_{enc}.spl" to avoid trouble with
filenames.

						    *spell-sug-file* *E781*
If there is a file with exactly the same name as the ".spl" file but ending in
".sug", that file will be used for giving better suggestions.  It isn't loaded
before suggestions are made to reduce memory use.

				    *E758* *E759* *E778* *E779* *E780* *E782*
When loading a spell file Vim checks that it is properly formatted.  If you
get an error the file may be truncated, modified or intended for another Vim
version.


SPELLFILE CLEANUP					*spellfile-cleanup*

The |zw| command turns existing entries in 'spellfile' into comment lines.
This avoids having to write a new file every time, but results in the file
only getting longer, never shorter.  To clean up the comment lines in all
".add" spell files do this: >
	:runtime spell/cleanadd.vim

This deletes all comment lines, except the ones that start with "##".  Use
"##" lines to add comments that you want to keep.

You can invoke this script as often as you like.  A variable is provided to
skip updating files that have been changed recently.  Set it to the number of
seconds that has passed since a file was changed before it will be cleaned.
For example, to clean only files that were not changed in the last hour: >
      let g:spell_clean_limit = 60 * 60
The default is one second.


WORDS

Vim uses a fixed method to recognize a word.  This is independent of
'iskeyword', so that it also works in help files and for languages that
include characters like '-' in 'iskeyword'.  The word characters do depend on
'encoding'.

The table with word characters is stored in the main .spl file.  Therefore it
matters what the current locale is when generating it!  A .add.spl file does
not contain a word table though.

For a word that starts with a digit the digit is ignored, unless the word as a
whole is recognized.  Thus if "3D" is a word and "D" is not then "3D" is
recognized as a word, but if "3D" is not a word then only the "D" is marked as
bad.  Hex numbers in the form 0x12ab and 0X12AB are recognized.


WORD COMBINATIONS

It is possible to spell-check words that include a space.  This is used to
recognize words that are invalid when used by themselves, e.g. for "et al.".
It can also be used to recognize "the the" and highlight it.

The number of spaces is irrelevant.  In most cases a line break may also
appear.  However, this makes it difficult to find out where to start checking
for spelling mistakes.  When you make a change to one line and only that line
is redrawn Vim won't look in the previous line, thus when "et" is at the end
of the previous line "al." will be flagged as an error.  And when you type
"the<CR>the" the highlighting doesn't appear until the first line is redrawn.
Use |CTRL-L| to redraw right away.  "[s" will also stop at a word combination
with a line break.

When encountering a line break Vim skips characters such as '*', '>' and '"',
so that comments in C, shell and Vim code can be spell checked.


SYNTAX HIGHLIGHTING					*spell-syntax*

Files that use syntax highlighting can specify where spell checking should be
done:

1.  everywhere			   default
2.  in specific items		   use "contains=@Spell"
3.  everywhere but specific items  use "contains=@NoSpell"

For the second method adding the @NoSpell cluster will disable spell checking
again.  This can be used, for example, to add @Spell to the comments of a
program, and add @NoSpell for items that shouldn't be checked.
Also see |:syn-spell| for text that is not in a syntax item.


VIM SCRIPTS

If you want to write a Vim script that does something with spelling, you may
find these functions useful:

    spellbadword()	find badly spelled word at the cursor
    spellsuggest()	get list of spelling suggestions
    soundfold()		get the sound-a-like version of a word


SETTING 'spellcapcheck' AUTOMATICALLY			*set-spc-auto*

After the 'spelllang' option has been set successfully, Vim will source the
files "spell/LANG.vim" in 'runtimepath'.  "LANG" is the value of 'spelllang'
up to the first comma, dot or underscore.  This can be used to set options
specifically for the language, especially 'spellcapcheck'.

The distribution includes a few of these files.  Use this command to see what
they do: >
	:next $VIMRUNTIME/spell/*.vim

Note that the default scripts don't set 'spellcapcheck' if it was changed from
the default value.  This assumes the user prefers another value then.


DOUBLE SCORING						*spell-double-scoring*

The 'spellsuggest' option can be used to select "double" scoring.  This
mechanism is based on the principle that there are two kinds of spelling
mistakes:

1. You know how to spell the word, but mistype something.  This results in a
   small editing distance (character swapped/omitted/inserted) and possibly a
   word that sounds completely different.

2. You don't know how to spell the word and type something that sounds right.
   The edit distance can be big but the word is similar after sound-folding.

Since scores for these two mistakes will be very different we use a list
for each and mix them.

The sound-folding is slow and people that know the language won't make the
second kind of mistakes.  Therefore 'spellsuggest' can be set to select the
preferred method for scoring the suggestions.

==============================================================================
3. Generating a spell file				*spell-mkspell*

Vim uses a binary file format for spelling.  This greatly speeds up loading
the word list and keeps it small.
						    *.aff* *.dic* *Myspell*
You can create a Vim spell file from the .aff and .dic files that Myspell
uses.  Myspell is used by OpenOffice.org and Mozilla. The OpenOffice .oxt 
files are zip files which contain the .aff and .dic files. You should be able
to find them here:
	http://extensions.services.openoffice.org/dictionary
The older, OpenOffice 2 files may be used if this doesn't work:
	http://wiki.services.openoffice.org/wiki/Dictionaries
You can also use a plain word list.  The results are the same, the choice
depends on what word lists you can find.

If you install Aap (from www.a-a-p.org) you can use the recipes in the
runtime/spell/??/ directories.  Aap will take care of downloading the files,
apply patches needed for Vim and build the .spl file.

Make sure your current locale is set properly, otherwise Vim doesn't know what
characters are upper/lower case letters.  If the locale isn't available (e.g.,
when using an MS-Windows codepage on Unix) add tables to the .aff file
|spell-affix-chars|.  If the .aff file doesn't define a table then the word
table of the currently active spelling is used.  If spelling is not active
then Vim will try to guess.

							*:mksp* *:mkspell*
:mksp[ell][!] [-ascii] {outname} {inname} ...
			Generate a Vim spell file from word lists.  Example: >
		:mkspell /tmp/nl nl_NL.words
<								*E751*
			When {outname} ends in ".spl" it is used as the output
			file name.  Otherwise it should be a language name,
			such as "en", without the region name.  The file
			written will be "{outname}.{encoding}.spl", where
			{encoding} is the value of the 'encoding' option.

			When the output file already exists [!] must be used
			to overwrite it.

			When the [-ascii] argument is present, words with
			non-ascii characters are skipped.  The resulting file
			ends in "ascii.spl".

			The input can be the Myspell format files {inname}.aff
			and {inname}.dic.  If {inname}.aff does not exist then
			{inname} is used as the file name of a plain word
			list.

			Multiple {inname} arguments can be given to combine
			regions into one Vim spell file.  Example: >
		:mkspell ~/.vim/spell/en /tmp/en_US /tmp/en_CA /tmp/en_AU
<			This combines the English word lists for US, CA and AU
			into one en.spl file.
			Up to eight regions can be combined. *E754* *E755*
			The REP and SAL items of the first .aff file where
			they appear are used. |spell-REP| |spell-SAL|
								*E845*
			This command uses a lot of memory, required to find
			the optimal word tree (Polish, Italian and Hungarian
			require several hundred Mbyte).  The final result will
			be much smaller, because compression is used.  To
			avoid running out of memory compression will be done
			now and then.  This can be tuned with the 'mkspellmem'
			option.

			After the spell file was written and it was being used
			in a buffer it will be reloaded automatically.

:mksp[ell] [-ascii] {name}.{enc}.add
			Like ":mkspell" above, using {name}.{enc}.add as the
			input file and producing an output file in the same
			directory that has ".spl" appended.

:mksp[ell] [-ascii] {name}
			Like ":mkspell" above, using {name} as the input file
			and producing an output file in the same directory
			that has ".{enc}.spl" appended.

Vim will report the number of duplicate words.  This might be a mistake in the
list of words.  But sometimes it is used to have different prefixes and
suffixes for the same basic word to avoid them combining (e.g. Czech uses
this).  If you want Vim to report all duplicate words set the 'verbose'
option.

Since you might want to change a Myspell word list for use with Vim the
following procedure is recommended:

1. Obtain the xx_YY.aff and xx_YY.dic files from Myspell.
2. Make a copy of these files to xx_YY.orig.aff and xx_YY.orig.dic.
3. Change the xx_YY.aff and xx_YY.dic files to remove bad words, add missing
   words, define word characters with FOL/LOW/UPP, etc.  The distributed
   "*.diff" files can be used.
4. Start Vim with the right locale and use |:mkspell| to generate the Vim
   spell file.
5. Try out the spell file with ":set spell spelllang=xx" if you wrote it in
   a spell directory in 'runtimepath', or ":set spelllang=xx.enc.spl" if you
   wrote it somewhere else.

When the Myspell files are updated you can merge the differences:
1. Obtain the new Myspell files as xx_YY.new.aff and xx_UU.new.dic.
2. Use Vimdiff to see what changed: >
	vimdiff xx_YY.orig.dic xx_YY.new.dic
3. Take over the changes you like in xx_YY.dic.
   You may also need to change xx_YY.aff.
4. Rename xx_YY.new.dic to xx_YY.orig.dic and xx_YY.new.aff to xx_YY.new.aff.


SPELL FILE VERSIONS					*E770* *E771* *E772*

Spell checking is a relatively new feature in Vim, thus it's possible that the
.spl file format will be changed to support more languages.  Vim will check
the validity of the spell file and report anything wrong.

	E771: Old spell file, needs to be updated ~
This spell file is older than your Vim.  You need to update the .spl file.

	E772: Spell file is for newer version of Vim ~
This means the spell file was made for a later version of Vim.  You need to
update Vim.

	E770: Unsupported section in spell file ~
This means the spell file was made for a later version of Vim and contains a
section that is required for the spell file to work.  In this case it's
probably a good idea to upgrade your Vim.


SPELL FILE DUMP

If for some reason you want to check what words are supported by the currently
used spelling files, use this command:

							*:spelldump* *:spelld*
:spelld[ump]		Open a new window and fill it with all currently valid
			words.  Compound words are not included.
			Note: For some languages the result may be enormous,
			causing Vim to run out of memory.

:spelld[ump]!		Like ":spelldump" and include the word count.  This is
			the number of times the word was found while
			updating the screen.  Words that are in COMMON items
			get a starting count of 10.

The format of the word list is used |spell-wordlist-format|.  You should be
able to read it with ":mkspell" to generate one .spl file that includes all
the words.

When all entries to 'spelllang' use the same regions or no regions at all then
the region information is included in the dumped words.  Otherwise only words
for the current region are included and no "/regions" line is generated.

Comment lines with the name of the .spl file are used as a header above the
words that were generated from that .spl file.


SPELL FILE MISSING		*spell-SpellFileMissing* *spellfile.vim*

If the spell file for the language you are using is not available, you will
get an error message.  But if the "spellfile.vim" plugin is active it will
offer you to download the spell file.  Just follow the instructions, it will
ask you where to write the file (there must be a writable directory in
'runtimepath' for this).

The plugin has a default place where to look for spell files, on the Vim ftp
server.  If you want to use another location or another protocol, set the
g:spellfile_URL variable to the directory that holds the spell files.  The
|netrw| plugin is used for getting the file, look there for the specific
syntax of the URL.  Example: >
	let g:spellfile_URL = 'http://ftp.vim.org/vim/runtime/spell'
You may need to escape special characters.

The plugin will only ask about downloading a language once.  If you want to
try again anyway restart Vim, or set g:spellfile_URL to another value (e.g.,
prepend a space).

To avoid using the "spellfile.vim" plugin do this in your vimrc file: >

	let loaded_spellfile_plugin = 1

Instead of using the plugin you can define a |SpellFileMissing| autocommand to
handle the missing file yourself.  You can use it like this: >

	:au SpellFileMissing * call Download_spell_file(expand('<amatch>'))

Thus the <amatch> item contains the name of the language.  Another important
value is 'encoding', since every encoding has its own spell file.  With two
exceptions:
- For ISO-8859-15 (latin9) the name "latin1" is used (the encodings only
  differ in characters not used in dictionary words).
- The name "ascii" may also be used for some languages where the words use
  only ASCII letters for most of the words.

The default "spellfile.vim" plugin uses this autocommand, if you define your
autocommand afterwards you may want to use ":au! SpellFileMissing" to overrule
it.  If you define your autocommand before the plugin is loaded it will notice
this and not do anything.
							*E797*
Note that the SpellFileMissing autocommand must not change or destroy the
buffer the user was editing.

==============================================================================
4. Spell file format					*spell-file-format*

This is the format of the files that are used by the person who creates and
maintains a word list.

Note that we avoid the word "dictionary" here.  That is because the goal of
spell checking differs from writing a dictionary (as in the book).  For
spelling we need a list of words that are OK, thus should not be highlighted.
Person and company names will not appear in a dictionary, but do appear in a
word list.  And some old words are rarely used while they are common
misspellings.  These do appear in a dictionary but not in a word list.

There are two formats: A straight list of words and a list using affix
compression.  The files with affix compression are used by Myspell (Mozilla
and OpenOffice.org).  This requires two files, one with .aff and one with .dic
extension.


FORMAT OF STRAIGHT WORD LIST				*spell-wordlist-format*

The words must appear one per line.  That is all that is required.

Additionally the following items are recognized:

- Empty and blank lines are ignored.

	# comment ~
- Lines starting with a # are ignored (comment lines).

	/encoding=utf-8 ~
- A line starting with "/encoding=", before any word, specifies the encoding
  of the file.  After the second '=' comes an encoding name.  This tells Vim
  to setup conversion from the specified encoding to 'encoding'.  Thus you can
  use one word list for several target encodings.

	/regions=usca ~
- A line starting with "/regions=" specifies the region names that are
  supported.  Each region name must be two ASCII letters.  The first one is
  region 1.  Thus "/regions=usca" has region 1 "us" and region 2 "ca".
  In an addition word list the region names should be equal to the main word
  list!

- Other lines starting with '/' are reserved for future use.  The ones that
  are not recognized are ignored.  You do get a warning message, so that you
  know something won't work.

- A "/" may follow the word with the following items:
    =		Case must match exactly.
    ?		Rare word.
    !		Bad (wrong) word.
    digit	A region in which the word is valid.  If no regions are
		specified the word is valid in all regions.

Example:

	# This is an example word list		comment
	/encoding=latin1			encoding of the file
	/regions=uscagb				regions "us", "ca" and "gb"
	example					word for all regions
	blah/12					word for regions "us" and "ca"
	vim/!					bad word
	Campbell/?3				rare word in region 3 "gb"
	's mornings/=				keep-case word

Note that when "/=" is used the same word with all upper-case letters is not
accepted.  This is different from a word with mixed case that is automatically
marked as keep-case, those words may appear in all upper-case letters.


FORMAT WITH .AFF AND .DIC FILES				*aff-dic-format*

There are two files: the basic word list and an affix file.  The affix file
specifies settings for the language and can contain affixes.  The affixes are
used to modify the basic words to get the full word list.  This significantly
reduces the number of words, especially for a language like Polish.  This is
called affix compression.

The basic word list and the affix file are combined with the ":mkspell"
command and results in a binary spell file.  All the preprocessing has been
done, thus this file loads fast.  The binary spell file format is described in
the source code (src/spell.c).  But only developers need to know about it.

The preprocessing also allows us to take the Myspell language files and modify
them before the Vim word list is made.  The tools for this can be found in the
"src/spell" directory.

The format for the affix and word list files is based on what Myspell uses
(the spell checker of Mozilla and OpenOffice.org).  A description can be found
here:
	http://lingucomponent.openoffice.org/affix.readme ~
Note that affixes are case sensitive, this isn't obvious from the description.

Vim supports quite a few extras.  They are described below |spell-affix-vim|.
Attempts have been made to keep this compatible with other spell checkers, so
that the same files can often be used.  One other project that offers more
than Myspell is Hunspell ( http://hunspell.sf.net ).


WORD LIST FORMAT				*spell-dic-format*

A short example, with line numbers:

	1	1234 ~
	2	aan ~
	3	Als ~
	4	Etten-Leur ~
	5	et al. ~
	6	's-Gravenhage ~
	7	's-Gravenhaags ~
	8	# word that differs between regions ~
	9	kado/1 ~
	10	cadeau/2 ~
	11	TCP,IP ~
	12	/the S affix may add a 's' ~
	13	bedel/S ~

The first line contains the number of words.  Vim ignores it, but you do get
an error message if it's not there.  *E760*

What follows is one word per line.  White space at the end of the line is
ignored, all other white space matters.  The encoding is specified in the
affix file |spell-SET|.

Comment lines start with '#' or '/'.  See the example lines 8 and 12.  Note
that putting a comment after a word is NOT allowed:

		someword   # comment that causes an error! ~

After the word there is an optional slash and flags.  Most of these flags are
letters that indicate the affixes that can be used with this word.  These are
specified with SFX and PFX lines in the .aff file, see |spell-SFX| and
|spell-PFX|.  Vim allows using other flag types with the FLAG item in the
affix file |spell-FLAG|.

When the word only has lower-case letters it will also match with the word
starting with an upper-case letter.

When the word includes an upper-case letter, this means the upper-case letter
is required at this position.  The same word with a lower-case letter at this
position will not match. When some of the other letters are upper-case it will
not match either.

The word with all upper-case characters will always be OK,

	word list	matches			does not match ~
	als		als Als ALS		ALs AlS aLs aLS
	Als		Als  ALS		als ALs AlS aLs aLS
	ALS		ALS			als Als ALs AlS aLs aLS
	AlS		AlS ALS			als Als ALs aLs aLS

The KEEPCASE affix ID can be used to specifically match a word with identical
case only, see below |spell-KEEPCASE|.

Note: in line 5 to 7 non-word characters are used.  You can include any
character in a word.  When checking the text a word still only matches when it
appears with a non-word character before and after it.  For Myspell a word
starting with a non-word character probably won't work.

In line 12 the word "TCP/IP" is defined.  Since the slash has a special
meaning the comma is used instead.  This is defined with the SLASH item in the
affix file, see |spell-SLASH|.  Note that without this SLASH item the word
will be "TCP,IP".


AFFIX FILE FORMAT			*spell-aff-format* *spell-affix-vim*

							*spell-affix-comment*
Comment lines in the .aff file start with a '#':

	# comment line ~

Items with a fixed number of arguments can be followed by a comment.  But only
if none of the arguments can contain white space.  The comment must start with
a "#" character.  Example:

	KEEPCASE =  # fix case for words with this flag ~


ENCODING							*spell-SET*

The affix file can be in any encoding that is supported by "iconv".  However,
in some cases the current locale should also be set properly at the time
|:mkspell| is invoked.  Adding FOL/LOW/UPP lines removes this requirement
|spell-FOL|.

The encoding should be specified before anything where the encoding matters.
The encoding applies both to the affix file and the dictionary file.  It is
done with a SET line:

	SET utf-8 ~

The encoding can be different from the value of the 'encoding' option at the
time ":mkspell" is used.  Vim will then convert everything to 'encoding' and
generate a spell file for 'encoding'.  If some of the used characters to not
fit in 'encoding' you will get an error message.
							*spell-affix-mbyte*
When using a multi-byte encoding it's possible to use more different affix
flags.  But Myspell doesn't support that, thus you may not want to use it
anyway.  For compatibility use an 8-bit encoding.


INFORMATION

These entries in the affix file can be used to add information to the spell
file.  There are no restrictions on the format, but they should be in the
right encoding.

used to view the info.

							*:spellinfo* *:spelli*
:spelli[nfo]		Display the information for the spell file(s) used for
			the current buffer.


CHARACTER TABLES
							*spell-affix-chars*
When using an 8-bit encoding the affix file should define what characters are
word characters.  This is because the system where ":mkspell" is used may not
support a locale with this encoding and isalpha() won't work.  For example
when using "cp1250" on Unix.
						*E761* *E762* *spell-FOL*
						*spell-LOW* *spell-UPP*
Three lines in the affix file are needed.  Simplistic example:

	FOL   ~
	LOW   ~
	UPP   ~

All three lines must have exactly the same number of characters.

The "FOL" line specifies the case-folded characters.  These are used to
compare words while ignoring case.  For most encodings this is identical to
the lower case line.

The "LOW" line specifies the characters in lower-case.  Mostly it's equal to
the "FOL" line.

The "UPP" line specifies the characters with upper-case.  That is, a character
is upper-case where it's different from the character at the same position in
"FOL".

An exception is made for the German sharp s .  The upper-case version is
"SS".  In the FOL/LOW/UPP lines it should be included, so that it's recognized
as a word character, but use the  character in all three.

ASCII characters should be omitted, Vim always handles these in the same way.
When the encoding is UTF-8 no word characters need to be specified.

							*E763*
Vim allows you to use spell checking for several languages in the same file.
You can list them in the 'spelllang' option.  As a consequence all spell files
for the same encoding must use the same word characters, otherwise they can't
be combined without errors.

If you get an E763 warning that the word tables differ you need to update your
".spl" spell files.  If you downloaded the files, get the latest version of
all spell files you use.  If you are only using one, e.g., German, then also
download the recent English spell files.  Otherwise generate the .spl file
again with |:mkspell|.  If you still get errors check the FOL, LOW and UPP
lines in the used .aff files.

The XX.ascii.spl spell file generated with the "-ascii" argument will not
contain the table with characters, so that it can be combine with spell files
for any encoding.  The .add.spl files also do not contain the table.


MID-WORD CHARACTERS
							*spell-midword*
Some characters are only to be considered word characters if they are used in
between two ordinary word characters.  An example is the single quote: It is
often used to put text in quotes, thus it can't be recognized as a word
character, but when it appears in between word characters it must be part of
the word.  This is needed to detect a spelling error such as they'are.  That
should be they're, but since "they" and "are" are words themselves that would
go unnoticed.

These characters are defined with MIDWORD in the .aff file.  Example:

	MIDWORD	'- ~


FLAG TYPES						*spell-FLAG*

Flags are used to specify the affixes that can be used with a word and for
other properties of the word.  Normally single-character flags are used.  This
limits the number of possible flags, especially for 8-bit encodings.  The FLAG
item can be used if more affixes are to be used.  Possible values:

	FLAG long	use two-character flags
	FLAG num	use numbers, from 1 up to 65000
	FLAG caplong	use one-character flags without A-Z and two-character
			flags that start with A-Z

With "FLAG num" the numbers in a list of affixes need to be separated with a
comma: "234,2143,1435".  This method is inefficient, but useful if the file is
generated with a program.

When using "caplong" the two-character flags all start with a capital: "Aa",
"B1", "BB", etc.  This is useful to use one-character flags for the most
common items and two-character flags for uncommon items.

Note: When using utf-8 only characters up to 65000 may be used for flags.

Note: even when using "num" or "long" the number of flags available to
compounding and prefixes is limited to about 250.


AFFIXES
					    *spell-PFX* *spell-SFX*
The usual PFX (prefix) and SFX (suffix) lines are supported (see the Myspell
documentation or the Aspell manual:
http://aspell.net/man-html/Affix-Compression.html).

Summary:
	SFX L Y 2 ~
	SFX L 0 re [^x] ~
	SFX L 0 ro x ~

The first line is a header and has four fields:
	SFX {flag} {combine} {count}

{flag}		The name used for the suffix.  Mostly it's a single letter,
		but other characters can be used, see |spell-FLAG|.

{combine}	Can be 'Y' or 'N'.  When 'Y' then the word plus suffix can
		also have a prefix.  When 'N' then a prefix is not allowed.

{count}		The number of lines following.  If this is wrong you will get
		an error message.

For PFX the fields are exactly the same.

The basic format for the following lines is:
	SFX {flag} {strip} {add} {condition} {extra}

{flag}		Must be the same as the {flag} used in the first line.

{strip}		Characters removed from the basic word.  There is no check if
		the characters are actually there, only the length is used (in
		bytes).  This better match the {condition}, otherwise strange
		things may happen.  If the {strip} length is equal to or
		longer than the basic word the suffix won't be used.
		When {strip} is 0 (zero) then nothing is stripped.

{add}		Characters added to the basic word, after removing {strip}.
		Optionally there is a '/' followed by flags.  The flags apply
		to the word plus affix.  See |spell-affix-flags|

{condition}	A simplistic pattern.  Only when this matches with a basic
		word will the suffix be used for that word.  This is normally
		for using one suffix letter with different {add} and {strip}
		fields for words with different endings.
		When {condition} is a . (dot) there is no condition.
		The pattern may contain:
		- Literal characters.
		- A set of characters in []. [abc] matches a, b and c.
		  A dash is allowed for a range [a-c], but this is
		  Vim-specific.
		- A set of characters that starts with a ^, meaning the
		  complement of the specified characters. [^abc] matches any
		  character but a, b and c.

{extra}		Optional extra text:
		    # comment		Comment is ignored
		    -			Hunspell uses this, ignored

For PFX the fields are the same, but the {strip}, {add} and {condition} apply
to the start of the word.

Note: Myspell ignores any extra text after the relevant info.  Vim requires
this text to start with a "#" so that mistakes don't go unnoticed.  Example:

	SFX F 0 in   [^i]n      # Spion > Spionin  ~
	SFX F 0 nen  in		# Bauerin > Bauerinnen ~

However, to avoid lots of errors in affix files written for Myspell, you can
add the IGNOREEXTRA flag.

Apparently Myspell allows an affix name to appear more than once.  Since this
might also be a mistake, Vim checks for an extra "S".  The affix files for
Myspell that use this feature apparently have this flag.  Example:

	SFX a Y 1 S ~
	SFX a 0 an . ~

	SFX a Y 2 S ~
	SFX a 0 en . ~
	SFX a 0 on . ~


AFFIX FLAGS						*spell-affix-flags*

This is a feature that comes from Hunspell: The affix may specify flags.  This
works similar to flags specified on a basic word.  The flags apply to the
basic word plus the affix (but there are restrictions).  Example:

	SFX S Y 1 ~
	SFX S 0 s . ~

	SFX A Y 1 ~
	SFX A 0 able/S . ~

When the dictionary file contains "drink/AS" then these words are possible:

	drink
	drinks		uses S suffix
	drinkable	uses A suffix
	drinkables	uses A suffix and then S suffix

Generally the flags of the suffix are added to the flags of the basic word,
both are used for the word plus suffix.  But the flags of the basic word are
only used once for affixes, except that both one prefix and one suffix can be
used when both support combining.

Specifically, the affix flags can be used for:
- Suffixes on suffixes, as in the example above.  This works once, thus you
  can have two suffixes on a word (plus one prefix).
- Making the word with the affix rare, by using the |spell-RARE| flag.
- Exclude the word with the affix from compounding, by using the
  |spell-COMPOUNDFORBIDFLAG| flag.
- Allow the word with the affix to be part of a compound word on the side of
  the affix with the |spell-COMPOUNDPERMITFLAG|.
- Use the NEEDCOMPOUND flag: word plus affix can only be used as part of a
  compound word. |spell-NEEDCOMPOUND|
- Compound flags: word plus affix can be part of a compound word at the end,
  middle, start, etc.  The flags are combined with the flags of the basic
  word.  |spell-compound|
- NEEDAFFIX: another affix is needed to make a valid word.
- CIRCUMFIX, as explained just below.


IGNOREEXTRA						*spell-IGNOREEXTRA*

Normally Vim gives an error for an extra field that does not start with '#'.
This avoids errors going unnoticed.  However, some files created for Myspell
or Hunspell may contain many entries with an extra field.  Use the IGNOREEXTRA
flag to avoid lots of errors.


CIRCUMFIX						*spell-CIRCUMFIX*

The CIRCUMFIX flag means a prefix and suffix must be added at the same time.
If a prefix has the CIRCUMFIX flag than only suffixes with the CIRCUMFIX flag
can be added, and the other way around.
An alternative is to only specify the suffix, and give the that suffix two
flags: The required prefix and the NEEDAFFIX flag.  |spell-NEEDAFFIX|


PFXPOSTPONE						*spell-PFXPOSTPONE*

When an affix file has very many prefixes that apply to many words it's not
possible to build the whole word list in memory.  This applies to Hebrew (a
list with all words is over a Gbyte).  In that case applying prefixes must be
postponed.  This makes spell checking slower.  It is indicated by this keyword
in the .aff file:

	PFXPOSTPONE ~

Only prefixes without a chop string and without flags can be postponed.
Prefixes with a chop string or with flags will still be included in the word
list.  An exception if the chop string is one character and equal to the last
character of the added string, but in lower case.  Thus when the chop string
is used to allow the following word to start with an upper case letter.


WORDS WITH A SLASH					*spell-SLASH*

The slash is used in the .dic file to separate the basic word from the affix
letters and other flags.  Unfortunately, this means you cannot use a slash in
a word.  Thus "TCP/IP" is not a word but "TCP" with the flags "IP".  To include
a slash in the word put a backslash before it: "TCP\/IP".  In the rare case
you want to use a backslash inside a word you need to use two backslashes.
Any other use of the backslash is reserved for future expansion.


KEEP-CASE WORDS						*spell-KEEPCASE*

In the affix file a KEEPCASE line can be used to define the affix name used
for keep-case words.  Example:

	KEEPCASE = ~

This flag is not supported by Myspell.  It has the meaning that case matters.
This can be used if the word does not have the first letter in upper case at
the start of a sentence.  Example:

    word list	    matches		    does not match ~
    's morgens/=    's morgens		    'S morgens 's Morgens 'S MORGENS
    's Morgens	    's Morgens 'S MORGENS   'S morgens 's morgens

The flag can also be used to avoid that the word matches when it is in all
upper-case letters.


RARE WORDS						*spell-RARE*

In the affix file a RARE line can be used to define the affix name used for
rare words.  Example:

	RARE ? ~

Rare words are highlighted differently from bad words.  This is to be used for
words that are correct for the language, but are hardly ever used and could be
a typing mistake anyway.  When the same word is found as good it won't be
highlighted as rare.

This flag can also be used on an affix, so that a basic word is not rare but
the basic word plus affix is rare |spell-affix-flags|.  However, if the word
also appears as a good word in another way (e.g., in another region) it won't
be marked as rare.


BAD WORDS						*spell-BAD*

In the affix file a BAD line can be used to define the affix name used for
bad words.  Example:

	BAD ! ~

This can be used to exclude words that would otherwise be good.  For example
"the the" in the .dic file:

	the the/! ~

Once a word has been marked as bad it won't be undone by encountering the same
word as good.

The flag also applies to the word with affixes, thus this can be used to mark
a whole bunch of related words as bad.

							*spell-FORBIDDENWORD*
FORBIDDENWORD can be used just like BAD.  For compatibility with Hunspell.

							*spell-NEEDAFFIX*
The NEEDAFFIX flag is used to require that a word is used with an affix.  The
word itself is not a good word (unless there is an empty affix).  Example:

	NEEDAFFIX + ~


COMPOUND WORDS						*spell-compound*

A compound word is a longer word made by concatenating words that appear in
the .dic file.  To specify which words may be concatenated a character is
used.  This character is put in the list of affixes after the word.  We will
call this character a flag here.  Obviously these flags must be different from
any affix IDs used.

							*spell-COMPOUNDFLAG*
The Myspell compatible method uses one flag, specified with COMPOUNDFLAG.  All
words with this flag combine in any order.  This means there is no control
over which word comes first.  Example:
	COMPOUNDFLAG c ~

							*spell-COMPOUNDRULE*
A more advanced method to specify how compound words can be formed uses
multiple items with multiple flags.  This is not compatible with Myspell 3.0.
Let's start with an example:
	COMPOUNDRULE c+ ~
	COMPOUNDRULE se ~

The first line defines that words with the "c" flag can be concatenated in any
order.  The second line defines compound words that are made of one word with
the "s" flag and one word with the "e" flag.  With this dictionary:
	bork/c ~
	onion/s ~
	soup/e ~

You can make these words:
	bork
	borkbork
	borkborkbork
	(etc.)
	onion
	soup
	onionsoup

The COMPOUNDRULE item may appear multiple times.  The argument is made out of
one or more groups, where each group can be:
	one flag			e.g., c
	alternate flags inside []	e.g., [abc]
Optionally this may be followed by:
	*	the group appears zero or more times, e.g., sm*e
	+	the group appears one or more times, e.g., c+
	?	the group appears zero times or once, e.g., x?

This is similar to the regexp pattern syntax (but not the same!).  A few
examples with the sequence of word flags they require:
    COMPOUNDRULE x+	    x xx xxx etc.
    COMPOUNDRULE yz	    yz
    COMPOUNDRULE x+z	    xz xxz xxxz etc.
    COMPOUNDRULE yx+	    yx yxx yxxx etc.
    COMPOUNDRULE xy?z	    xz xyz

    COMPOUNDRULE [abc]z    az bz cz
    COMPOUNDRULE [abc]+z   az aaz abaz bz baz bcbz cz caz cbaz etc.
    COMPOUNDRULE a[xyz]+   ax axx axyz ay ayx ayzz az azy azxy etc.
    COMPOUNDRULE sm*e	    se sme smme smmme etc.
    COMPOUNDRULE s[xyz]*e  se sxe sxye sxyxe sye syze sze szye szyxe  etc.

A specific example: Allow a compound to be made of two words and a dash:
	In the .aff file:
	    COMPOUNDRULE sde ~
	    NEEDAFFIX x ~
	    COMPOUNDWORDMAX 3 ~
	    COMPOUNDMIN 1 ~
	In the .dic file:
	    start/s ~
	    end/e ~
	    -/xd ~

This allows for the word "start-end", but not "startend".

An additional implied rule is that, without further flags, a word with a
prefix cannot be compounded after another word, and a word with a suffix
cannot be compounded with a following word.  Thus the affix cannot appear
on the inside of a compound word.  This can be changed with the
|spell-COMPOUNDPERMITFLAG|.

							*spell-NEEDCOMPOUND*
The NEEDCOMPOUND flag is used to require that a word is used as part of a
compound word.  The word itself is not a good word.  Example:

	NEEDCOMPOUND & ~

							*spell-ONLYINCOMPOUND*
The ONLYINCOMPOUND does exactly the same as NEEDCOMPOUND.  Supported for
compatibility with Hunspell.

							*spell-COMPOUNDMIN*
The minimal character length of a word used for compounding is specified with
COMPOUNDMIN.  Example:
	COMPOUNDMIN 5 ~

When omitted there is no minimal length.  Obviously you could just leave out
the compound flag from short words instead, this feature is present for
compatibility with Myspell.

							*spell-COMPOUNDWORDMAX*
The maximum number of words that can be concatenated into a compound word is
specified with COMPOUNDWORDMAX.  Example:
	COMPOUNDWORDMAX 3 ~

When omitted there is no maximum.  It applies to all compound words.

To set a limit for words with specific flags make sure the items in
COMPOUNDRULE where they appear don't allow too many words.

							*spell-COMPOUNDSYLMAX*
The maximum number of syllables that a compound word may contain is specified
with COMPOUNDSYLMAX.  Example:
	COMPOUNDSYLMAX 6 ~

This has no effect if there is no SYLLABLE item.  Without COMPOUNDSYLMAX there
is no limit on the number of syllables.

If both COMPOUNDWORDMAX and COMPOUNDSYLMAX are defined, a compound word is
accepted if it fits one of the criteria, thus is either made from up to
COMPOUNDWORDMAX words or contains up to COMPOUNDSYLMAX syllables.

						    *spell-COMPOUNDFORBIDFLAG*
The COMPOUNDFORBIDFLAG specifies a flag that can be used on an affix.  It
means that the word plus affix cannot be used in a compound word.  Example:
	affix file:
		COMPOUNDFLAG c ~
		COMPOUNDFORBIDFLAG x ~
		SFX a Y 2 ~
		SFX a 0 s   . ~
		SFX a 0 ize/x . ~
	dictionary:
		word/c ~
		util/ac ~

This allows for "wordutil" and "wordutils" but not "wordutilize".
Note: this doesn't work for postponed prefixes yet.

						    *spell-COMPOUNDPERMITFLAG*
The COMPOUNDPERMITFLAG specifies a flag that can be used on an affix.  It
means that the word plus affix can also be used in a compound word in a way
where the affix ends up halfway the word.  Without this flag that is not
allowed.
Note: this doesn't work for postponed prefixes yet.

						    *spell-COMPOUNDROOT*
The COMPOUNDROOT flag is used for words in the dictionary that are already a
compound.  This means it counts for two words when checking the compounding
rules.  Can also be used for an affix to count the affix as a compounding
word.

						*spell-CHECKCOMPOUNDPATTERN*
CHECKCOMPOUNDPATTERN is used to define patterns that, when matching at the
position where two words are compounded together forbids the compound.
For example:
	CHECKCOMPOUNDPATTERN o e ~

This forbids compounding if the first word ends in "o" and the second word
starts with "e".

The arguments must be plain text, no patterns are actually supported, despite
the item name.  Case is always ignored.

The Hunspell feature to use three arguments and flags is not supported.

							*spell-SYLLABLE*
The SYLLABLE item defines characters or character sequences that are used to
count the number of syllables in a word.  Example:
	SYLLABLE aeiouy/aa/au/ea/ee/ei/ie/oa/oe/oo/ou/uu/ui ~

Before the first slash is the set of characters that are counted for one
syllable, also when repeated and mixed, until the next character that is not
in this set.  After the slash come sequences of characters that are counted
for one syllable.  These are preferred over using characters from the set.
With the example "ideeen" has three syllables, counted by "i", "ee" and "e".

Only case-folded letters need to be included.

Another way to restrict compounding was mentioned above: Adding the
|spell-COMPOUNDFORBIDFLAG| flag to an affix causes all words that are made
with that affix to not be used for compounding.


UNLIMITED COMPOUNDING					*spell-NOBREAK*

For some languages, such as Thai, there is no space in between words.  This
looks like all words are compounded.  To specify this use the NOBREAK item in
the affix file, without arguments:
	NOBREAK ~

Vim will try to figure out where one word ends and a next starts.  When there
are spelling mistakes this may not be quite right.


							*spell-COMMON*
Common words can be specified with the COMMON item.  This will give better
suggestions when editing a short file.  Example:

	COMMON  the of to and a in is it you that he was for on are ~

The words must be separated by white space, up to 25 per line.
When multiple regions are specified in a ":mkspell" command the common words
for all regions are combined and used for all regions.

							*spell-NOSPLITSUGS*
This item indicates that splitting a word to make suggestions is not a good
idea.  Split-word suggestions will appear only when there are few similar
words.

	NOSPLITSUGS ~

							*spell-NOSUGGEST*
The flag specified with NOSUGGEST can be used for words that will not be
suggested.  Can be used for obscene words.

	NOSUGGEST % ~


REPLACEMENTS						*spell-REP*

In the affix file REP items can be used to define common mistakes.  This is
used to make spelling suggestions.  The items define the "from" text and the
"to" replacement.  Example:

	REP 4 ~
	REP f ph ~
	REP ph f ~
	REP k ch ~
	REP ch k ~

The first line specifies the number of REP lines following.  Vim ignores the
number, but it must be there (for compatibility with Myspell).

Don't include simple one-character replacements or swaps.  Vim will try these
anyway.  You can include whole words if you want to, but you might want to use
the "file:" item in 'spellsuggest' instead.

You can include a space by using an underscore:

	REP the_the the ~


SIMILAR CHARACTERS					*spell-MAP* *E783*

In the affix file MAP items can be used to define letters that are very much
alike.  This is mostly used for a letter with different accents.  This is used
to prefer suggestions with these letters substituted.  Example:

	MAP 2 ~
	MAP e ~
	MAP u ~

The first line specifies the number of MAP lines following.  Vim ignores the
number, but the line must be there.

Each letter must appear in only one of the MAP items.  It's a bit more
efficient if the first letter is ASCII or at least one without accents.


.SUG FILE						*spell-NOSUGFILE*

When soundfolding is specified in the affix file then ":mkspell" will normally
produce a .sug file next to the .spl file.  This file is used to find
suggestions by their sound-a-like form quickly.  At the cost of a lot of
memory (the amount depends on the number of words, |:mkspell| will display an
estimate when it's done).

To avoid producing a .sug file use this item in the affix file:

	NOSUGFILE ~

Users can simply omit the .sug file if they don't want to use it.


SOUND-A-LIKE						*spell-SAL*

In the affix file SAL items can be used to define the sounds-a-like mechanism
to be used.  The main items define the "from" text and the "to" replacement.
Simplistic example:

	SAL CIA			 X ~
	SAL CH			 X ~
	SAL C			 K ~
	SAL K			 K ~

There are a few rules and this can become quite complicated.  An explanation
how it works can be found in the Aspell manual:
http://aspell.net/man-html/Phonetic-Code.html.

There are a few special items:

	SAL followup		true ~
	SAL collapse_result	true ~
	SAL remove_accents	true ~

"1" has the same meaning as "true".  Any other value means "false".


SIMPLE SOUNDFOLDING				*spell-SOFOFROM* *spell-SOFOTO*

The SAL mechanism is complex and slow.  A simpler mechanism is mapping all
characters to another character, mapping similar sounding characters to the
same character.  At the same time this does case folding.  You can not have
both SAL items and simple soundfolding.

There are two items required: one to specify the characters that are mapped
and one that specifies the characters they are mapped to.  They must have
exactly the same number of characters.  Example:

    SOFOFROM abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ ~
    SOFOTO   ebctefghejklnnepkrstevvkesebctefghejklnnepkrstevvkes ~

In the example all vowels are mapped to the same character 'e'.  Another
method would be to leave out all vowels.  Some characters that sound nearly
the same and are often mixed up, such as 'm' and 'n', are mapped to the same
character.  Don't do this too much, all words will start looking alike.

Characters that do not appear in SOFOFROM will be left out, except that all
white space is replaced by one space.  Sequences of the same character in
SOFOFROM are replaced by one.

You can use the |soundfold()| function to try out the results.  Or set the
'verbose' option to see the score in the output of the |z=| command.


UNSUPPORTED ITEMS				*spell-affix-not-supported*

These items appear in the affix file of other spell checkers.  In Vim they are
ignored, not supported or defined in another way.

ACCENT		(Hunspell)				*spell-ACCENT*
		Use MAP instead. |spell-MAP|

BREAK		(Hunspell)				*spell-BREAK*
		Define break points.  Unclear how it works exactly.
		Not supported.

CHECKCOMPOUNDCASE  (Hunspell)			*spell-CHECKCOMPOUNDCASE*
		Disallow uppercase letters at compound word boundaries.
		Not supported.

CHECKCOMPOUNDDUP  (Hunspell)			*spell-CHECKCOMPOUNDDUP*
		Disallow using the same word twice in a compound.  Not
		supported.

CHECKCOMPOUNDREP  (Hunspell)			*spell-CHECKCOMPOUNDREP*
		Something about using REP items and compound words.  Not
		supported.

CHECKCOMPOUNDTRIPLE  (Hunspell)			*spell-CHECKCOMPOUNDTRIPLE*
		Forbid three identical characters when compounding.  Not
		supported.

COMPLEXPREFIXES  (Hunspell)				*spell-COMPLEXPREFIXES*
		Enables using two prefixes.  Not supported.

COMPOUND	(Hunspell)				*spell-COMPOUND*
		This is one line with the count of COMPOUND items, followed by
		that many COMPOUND lines with a pattern.
		Remove the first line with the count and rename the other
		items to COMPOUNDRULE |spell-COMPOUNDRULE|

COMPOUNDFIRST	(Hunspell)				*spell-COMPOUNDFIRST*
		Use COMPOUNDRULE instead. |spell-COMPOUNDRULE|

COMPOUNDBEGIN	(Hunspell)				*spell-COMPOUNDBEGIN*
		Use COMPOUNDRULE instead. |spell-COMPOUNDRULE|

COMPOUNDEND	(Hunspell)				*spell-COMPOUNDEND*
		Use COMPOUNDRULE instead. |spell-COMPOUNDRULE|

COMPOUNDMIDDLE	(Hunspell)				*spell-COMPOUNDMIDDLE*
		Use COMPOUNDRULE instead. |spell-COMPOUNDRULE|

COMPOUNDRULES	(Hunspell)				*spell-COMPOUNDRULES*
		Number of COMPOUNDRULE lines following.  Ignored, but the
		argument must be a number.

COMPOUNDSYLLABLE  (Hunspell)			*spell-COMPOUNDSYLLABLE*
		Use SYLLABLE and COMPOUNDSYLMAX instead. |spell-SYLLABLE|
		|spell-COMPOUNDSYLMAX|

KEY		(Hunspell)				*spell-KEY*
		Define characters that are close together on the keyboard.
		Used to give better suggestions.  Not supported.
		
LANG		(Hunspell)				*spell-LANG*
		This specifies language-specific behavior.  This actually
		moves part of the language knowledge into the program,
		therefore Vim does not support it.  Each language property
		must be specified separately.

LEMMA_PRESENT	(Hunspell)				*spell-LEMMA_PRESENT*
		Only needed for morphological analysis.

MAXNGRAMSUGS	(Hunspell)				*spell-MAXNGRAMSUGS*
		Set number of n-gram suggestions.  Not supported.

PSEUDOROOT	(Hunspell)				*spell-PSEUDOROOT*
		Use NEEDAFFIX instead. |spell-NEEDAFFIX|

SUGSWITHDOTS	(Hunspell)				*spell-SUGSWITHDOTS*
		Adds dots to suggestions.  Vim doesn't need this.

SYLLABLENUM	(Hunspell)				*spell-SYLLABLENUM*
		Not supported.

TRY		(Myspell, Hunspell, others)		*spell-TRY*
		Vim does not use the TRY item, it is ignored.  For making
		suggestions the actual characters in the words are used, that
		is much more efficient.

WORDCHARS	(Hunspell)				*spell-WORDCHARS*
		Used to recognize words.  Vim doesn't need it, because there

The creator of Vim is a computer programmer.  It's no surprise that Vim
contains many features to aid in writing programs.  Jump around to find where
identifiers are defined and used.  Preview declarations in a separate window.

==============================================================================
*29.1*	Using tags

What is a tag?  It is a location where an identifier is defined.  An example
is a function definition in a C or C++ program.  A list of tags is kept in a
tags file.  This can be used by Vim to directly jump from any place to the
tag, the place where an identifier is defined.
   To generate the tags file for all C files in the current directory, use the
following command: >

	ctags *.c

"ctags" is a separate program.  Most Unix systems already have it installed.
If you do not have it yet, you can find Exuberant ctags here:

	http://ctags.sf.net ~

Now when you are in Vim and you want to go to a function definition, you can
jump to it by using the following command: >

	:tag startlist

This command will find the function "startlist" even if it is in another file.
   The CTRL-] command jumps to the tag of the word that is under the cursor.
This makes it easy to explore a tangle of C code.  Suppose, for example, that
you are in the function "write_block".  You can see that it calls
"write_line".  But what does "write_line" do?  By placing the cursor on the
call to "write_line" and pressing CTRL-], you jump to the definition of this
function.
   The "write_line" function calls "write_char".  You need to figure out what
it does.  So you position the cursor over the call to "write_char" and press
CTRL-].  Now you are at the definition of "write_char".

	+-------------------------------------+
	|void write_block(char **s; int cnt)  |
	|{				      |
	|   int i;			      |
	|   for (i = 0; i < cnt; ++i)	      |
	|      write_line(s[i]);	      |
	|}	    |			      |
	+-----------|-------------------------+
		    |
	     CTRL-] |
		    |	 +----------------------------+
		    +--> |void write_line(char *s)    |
			 |{			      |
			 |   while (*s != 0)	      |
			 |	write_char(*s++);     |
			 |}	  |		      |
			 +--------|-------------------+
				  |
			   CTRL-] |
				  |    +------------------------------------+
				  +--> |void write_char(char c)		    |
				       |{				    |
				       |    putchar((int)(unsigned char)c); |
				       |}				    |
				       +------------------------------------+

The ":tags" command shows the list of tags that you traversed through:

	:tags
	  # TO tag	   FROM line  in file/text ~
	  1  1 write_line	   8  write_block.c ~
	  2  1 write_char	   7  write_line.c ~
	> ~
>
Now to go back.  The CTRL-T command goes to the preceding tag.  In the example
above you get back to the "write_line" function, in the call to "write_char".
   This command takes a count argument that indicates how many tags to jump
back.  You have gone forward, and now back.  Let's go forward again.  The
following command goes to the tag on top of the list: >

	:tag

You can prefix it with a count and jump forward that many tags.  For example:
":3tag".  CTRL-T also can be preceded with a count.
   These commands thus allow you to go down a call tree with CTRL-] and back
up again with CTRL-T.  Use ":tags" to find out where you are.


SPLIT WINDOWS

The ":tag" command replaces the file in the current window with the one
containing the new function.  But suppose you want to see not only the old
function but also the new one?  You can split the window using the ":split"
command followed by the ":tag" command.  Vim has a shorthand command that does
both: >
	:stag tagname

To split the current window and jump to the tag under the cursor use this
command: >

	CTRL-W ]

If a count is specified, the new window will be that many lines high.


MORE TAGS FILES

When you have files in many directories, you can create a tags file in each of
them.  Vim will then only be able to jump to tags within that directory.
   To find more tags files, set the 'tags' option to include all the relevant
tags files.  Example: >

	:set tags=./tags,./../tags,./*/tags

This finds a tags file in the same directory as the current file, one
directory level higher and in all subdirectories.
   This is quite a number of tags files, but it may still not be enough.  For
example, when editing a file in "~/proj/src", you will not find the tags file
"~/proj/sub/tags".  For this situation Vim offers to search a whole directory
tree for tags files.  Example: >

	:set tags=~/proj/**/tags


ONE TAGS FILE

When Vim has to search many places for tags files, you can hear the disk
rattling.  It may get a bit slow.  In that case it's better to spend this
time while generating one big tags file.  You might do this overnight.
   This requires the Exuberant ctags program, mentioned above.  It offers an
argument to search a whole directory tree: >

	cd ~/proj
	ctags -R .

The nice thing about this is that Exuberant ctags recognizes various file
types.  Thus this doesn't work just for C and C++ programs, also for Eiffel
and even Vim scripts.  See the ctags documentation to tune this.
   Now you only need to tell Vim where your big tags file is: >

	:set tags=~/proj/tags


MULTIPLE MATCHES

When a function is defined multiple times (or a method in several classes),
the ":tag" command will jump to the first one.  If there is a match in the
current file, that one is used first.
   You can now jump to other matches for the same tag with: >

	:tnext

Repeat this to find further matches.  If there are many, you can select which
one to jump to: >

	:tselect tagname

Vim will present you with a list of choices:

	  # pri kind tag	       file ~
	  1 F	f    mch_init	       os_amiga.c ~
		       mch_init() ~
	  2 F	f    mch_init	       os_mac.c ~
		       mch_init() ~
	  3 F	f    mch_init	       os_msdos.c ~
		       mch_init(void) ~
	  4 F	f    mch_init	       os_riscos.c ~
		       mch_init() ~
	Enter nr of choice (<CR> to abort):  ~

You can now enter the number (in the first column) of the match that you would
like to jump to.  The information in the other columns give you a good idea of
where the match is defined.

To move between the matching tags, these commands can be used:

	:tfirst			go to first match
	:[count]tprevious	go to [count] previous match
	:[count]tnext		go to [count] next match
	:tlast			go to last match

If [count] is omitted then one is used.


GUESSING TAG NAMES

Command line completion is a good way to avoid typing a long tag name.  Just
type the first bit and press <Tab>: >

	:tag write_<Tab>

You will get the first match.  If it's not the one you want, press <Tab> until
you find the right one.
   Sometimes you only know part of the name of a function.  Or you have many
tags that start with the same string, but end differently.  Then you can tell
Vim to use a pattern to find the tag.
   Suppose you want to jump to a tag that contains "block".  First type
this: >

	:tag /block

Now use command line completion: press <Tab>.  Vim will find all tags that
contain "block" and use the first match.
   The "/" before a tag name tells Vim that what follows is not a literal tag
name, but a pattern.  You can use all the items for search patterns here.  For
example, suppose you want to select a tag that starts with "write_": >

	:tselect /^write_

The "^" specifies that the tag starts with "write_".  Otherwise it would also
be found halfway a tag name.  Similarly "$" at the end makes sure the pattern
matches until the end of a tag.


A TAGS BROWSER

Since CTRL-] takes you to the definition of the identifier under the cursor,
you can use a list of identifier names as a table of contents.  Here is an
example.
   First create a list of identifiers (this requires Exuberant ctags): >

	ctags --c-types=f -f functions *.c

Now start Vim without a file, and edit this file in Vim, in a vertically split
window: >

	vim
	:vsplit functions

The window contains a list of all the functions.  There is some more stuff,
but you can ignore that.  Do ":setlocal ts=99" to clean it up a bit.
   In this window, define a mapping: >

	:nnoremap <buffer> <CR> 0ye<C-W>w:tag <C-R>"<CR>

Move the cursor to the line that contains the function you want to go to.
Now press <Enter>.  Vim will go to the other window and jump to the selected
function.


RELATED ITEMS

You can set 'ignorecase' to make case in tag names be ignored.

The 'tagbsearch' option tells if the tags file is sorted or not.  The default
is to assume a sorted tags file, which makes a tags search a lot faster, but
doesn't work if the tags file isn't sorted.

The 'taglength' option can be used to tell Vim the number of significant
characters in a tag.

When you use the SNiFF+ program, you can use the Vim interface to it |sniff|.
SNiFF+ is a commercial program.

Cscope is a free program.  It does not only find places where an identifier is
declared, but also where it is used.  See |cscope|.

==============================================================================
*29.2*	The preview window

When you edit code that contains a function call, you need to use the correct
arguments.  To know what values to pass you can look at how the function is
defined.  The tags mechanism works very well for this.  Preferably the
definition is displayed in another window.  For this the preview window can be
used.
   To open a preview window to display the function "write_char": >

	:ptag write_char

Vim will open a window, and jumps to the tag "write_char".  Then it takes you
back to the original position.  Thus you can continue typing without the need
to use a CTRL-W command.
   If the name of a function appears in the text, you can get its definition
in the preview window with: >

	CTRL-W }

There is a script that automatically displays the text where the word under
the cursor was defined.  See |CursorHold-example|.

To close the preview window use this command: >

	:pclose

To edit a specific file in the preview window, use ":pedit".  This can be
useful to edit a header file, for example: >

	:pedit defs.h

Finally, ":psearch" can be used to find a word in the current file and any
included files and display the match in the preview window.  This is
especially useful when using library functions, for which you do not have a
tags file.  Example: >

	:psearch popen

This will show the "stdio.h" file in the preview window, with the function
prototype for popen():

	FILE	*popen __P((const char *, const char *)); ~

You can specify the height of the preview window, when it is opened, with the
'previewheight' option.

==============================================================================
*29.3*	Moving through a program

Since a program is structured, Vim can recognize items in it.  Specific
commands can be used to move around.
   C programs often contain constructs like this:

	#ifdef USE_POPEN ~
	    fd = popen("ls", "r") ~
	#else ~
	    fd = fopen("tmp", "w") ~
	#endif ~

But then much longer, and possibly nested.  Position the cursor on the
"#ifdef" and press %.  Vim will jump to the "#else".  Pressing % again takes
you to the "#endif".  Another % takes you to the "#ifdef" again.
   When the construct is nested, Vim will find the matching items.  This is a
good way to check if you didn't forget an "#endif".
   When you are somewhere inside a "#if" - "#endif", you can jump to the start
of it with: >

	[#

If you are not after a "#if" or "#ifdef" Vim will beep.  To jump forward to
the next "#else" or "#endif" use: >

	]#

These two commands skip any "#if" - "#endif" blocks that they encounter.
Example:

	#if defined(HAS_INC_H) ~
	    a = a + inc(); ~
	# ifdef USE_THEME ~
	    a += 3; ~
	# endif ~
	    set_width(a); ~

With the cursor in the last line, "[#" moves to the first line.  The "#ifdef"
- "#endif" block in the middle is skipped.


MOVING IN CODE BLOCKS

In C code blocks are enclosed in {}.  These can get pretty long.  To move to
the start of the outer block use the "[[" command.  Use "][" to find the end.
This assumes that the "{" and "}" are in the first column.
   The "[{" command moves to the start of the current block.  It skips over
pairs of {} at the same level.  "]}" jumps to the end.
   An overview:

			function(int a)
	   +->		{
	   |		    if (a)
	   |	   +->	    {
	[[ |	   |		for (;;)	       --+
	   |	   |	  +->	{			 |
	   |	[{ |	  |	    foo(32);		 |     --+
	   |	   |   [{ |	    if (bar(a))  --+	 | ]}	 |
	   +--	   |	  +--		break;	   | ]}  |	 |
		   |		}		 <-+	 |	 | ][
		   +--		foobar(a)		 |	 |
			    }			       <-+	 |
			}				       <-+

When writing C++ or Java, the outer {} block is for the class.  The next level
of {} is for a method.  When somewhere inside a class use "[m" to find the
previous start of a method.  "]m" finds the next start of a method.

Additionally, "[]" moves backward to the end of a function and "]]" moves
forward to the start of the next function.  The end of a function is defined
by a "}" in the first column.

				int func1(void)
				{
					return 1;
		  +---------->  }
		  |
	      []  |		int func2(void)
		  |	   +->	{
		  |    [[  |		if (flag)
	start	  +--	   +--			return flag;
		  |    ][  |		return 2;
		  |	   +->	}
	      ]]  |
		  |		int func3(void)
		  +---------->	{
					return 3;
				}

Don't forget you can also use "%" to move between matching (), {} and [].
That also works when they are many lines apart.


MOVING IN BRACES

The "[(" and "])" commands work similar to "[{" and "]}", except that they
work on () pairs instead of {} pairs.
>
				  [(
<		    <--------------------------------
			      <-------
		if (a == b && (c == d || (e > f)) && x > y) ~
				  -------------->
			  --------------------------------> >
				       ])

MOVING IN COMMENTS

To move back to the start of a comment use "[/".  Move forward to the end of a
comment with "]/".  This only works for /* - */ comments.

	  +->	  +-> /*
	  |    [/ |    * A comment about      --+
       [/ |	  +--  * wonderful life.	| ]/
	  |	       */		      <-+
	  |
	  +--	       foo = bar * 3;	      --+
						| ]/
		       /* a short comment */  <-+

==============================================================================
*29.4*	Finding global identifiers

You are editing a C program and wonder if a variable is declared as "int" or
"unsigned".  A quick way to find this is with the "[I" command.
   Suppose the cursor is on the word "column".  Type: >

	[I

Vim will list the matching lines it can find.  Not only in the current file,
but also in all included files (and files included in them, etc.).  The result
looks like this:

	structs.h ~
	 1:   29     unsigned     column;    /* column number */ ~

The advantage over using tags or the preview window is that included files are
searched.  In most cases this results in the right declaration to be found.
Also when the tags file is out of date.  Also when you don't have tags for the
included files.
   However, a few things must be right for "[I" to do its work.  First of all,
the 'include' option must specify how a file is included.  The default value
works for C and C++.  For other languages you will have to change it.


LOCATING INCLUDED FILES

   Vim will find included files in the places specified with the 'path'
option.  If a directory is missing, some include files will not be found.  You
can discover this with this command: >

	:checkpath

It will list the include files that could not be found.  Also files included
by the files that could be found.  An example of the output:

	--- Included files not found in path --- ~
	<io.h> ~
	vim.h --> ~
	  <functions.h> ~
	  <clib/exec_protos.h> ~

The "io.h" file is included by the current file and can't be found.  "vim.h"
can be found, thus ":checkpath" goes into this file and checks what it
includes.  The "functions.h" and "clib/exec_protos.h" files, included by
"vim.h" are not found.

	Note:
	Vim is not a compiler.  It does not recognize "#ifdef" statements.
	This means every "#include" statement is used, also when it comes
	after "#if NEVER".

To fix the files that could not be found, add a directory to the 'path'
option.  A good place to find out about this is the Makefile.  Look out for
lines that contain "-I" items, like "-I/usr/local/X11".  To add this directory
use: >

	:set path+=/usr/local/X11

When there are many subdirectories, you can use the "*" wildcard.  Example: >

	:set path+=/usr/*/include

This would find files in "/usr/local/include" as well as "/usr/X11/include".

When working on a project with a whole nested tree of included files, the "**"
items is useful.  This will search down in all subdirectories.  Example: >

	:set path+=/projects/invent/**/include

This will find files in the directories:

	/projects/invent/include ~
	/projects/invent/main/include ~
	/projects/invent/main/os/include ~
	etc.

There are even more possibilities.  Check out the 'path' option for info.
   If you want to see which included files are actually found, use this
command: >

	:checkpath!

You will get a (very long) list of included files, the files they include, and
so on.  To shorten the list a bit, Vim shows "(Already listed)" for files that
were found before and doesn't list the included files in there again.


JUMPING TO A MATCH

"[I" produces a list with only one line of text.  When you want to have a
closer look at the first item, you can jump to that line with the command: >

	[<Tab>

You can also use "[ CTRL-I", since CTRL-I is the same as pressing <Tab>.

The list that "[I" produces has a number at the start of each line.  When you
want to jump to another item than the first one, type the number first: >

	3[<Tab>

Will jump to the third item in the list.  Remember that you can use CTRL-O to
jump back to where you started from.


RELATED COMMANDS

	[i		only lists the first match
	]I		only lists items below the cursor
	]i		only lists the first item below the cursor


FINDING DEFINED IDENTIFIERS

The "[I" command finds any identifier.  To find only macros, defined with
"#define" use: >

	[D

Again, this searches in included files.  The 'define' option specifies what a
line looks like that defines the items for "[D".  You could change it to make
it work with other languages than C or C++.
   The commands related to "[D" are:

	[d		only lists the first match
	]D		only lists items below the cursor
	]d		only lists the first item below the cursor

==============================================================================
*29.5*	Finding local identifiers

The "[I" command searches included files.  To search in the current file only,
and jump to the first place where the word under the cursor is used: >

	gD

Hint: Goto Definition.  This command is very useful to find a variable or
function that was declared locally ("static", in C terms).  Example (cursor on
"counter"):

	   +->   static int counter = 0;
	   |
	   |     int get_counter(void)
	gD |     {
	   |	     ++counter;
	   +--	     return counter;
		 }

To restrict the search even further, and look only in the current function,
use this command: >

	gd

This will go back to the start of the current function and find the first
occurrence of the word under the cursor.  Actually, it searches backwards to
an empty line above a "{" in the first column.  From there it searches forward
for the identifier.  Example (cursor on "idx"):

		int find_entry(char *name)
		{
	   +->	    int idx;
	   |
	gd |	    for (idx = 0; idx < table_len; ++idx)
	   |		if (strcmp(table[idx].name, name) == 0)
	   +--		    return idx;
		}

  For Vim version 7.4.  Last change: 2013 Feb 23


		  VIM REFERENCE MANUAL    by Bram Moolenaar


This file contains an alphabetical list of messages and error messages that
Vim produces.  You can use this if you don't understand what the message
means.  It is not complete though.

1. Old messages		|:messages|
2. Error messages	|error-messages|
3. Messages		|messages|

==============================================================================
1. Old messages			*:messages* *:mes* *message-history*

The ":messages" command can be used to view previously given messages.  This
is especially useful when messages have been overwritten or truncated.  This
depends on the 'shortmess' option.

The number of remembered messages is fixed at 20 for the tiny version and 200
for other versions.

								*g<*
The "g<" command can be used to see the last page of previous command output.
This is especially useful if you accidentally typed <Space> at the hit-enter
prompt.  You are then back at the hit-enter prompt and can then scroll further
back.
Note: If the output has been stopped with "q" at the more prompt, it will only
be displayed up to this point.
The previous command output is cleared when another command produces output.

If you are using translated messages, the first printed line tells who
maintains the messages or the translations.  You can use this to contact the
maintainer when you spot a mistake.

If you want to find help on a specific (error) message, use the ID at the
start of the message.  For example, to get help on the message: >

	E72: Close error on swap file

or (translated): >

	E72: Errore durante chiusura swap file

Use: >

	:help E72

If you are lazy, it also works without the shift key: >

	:help e72

==============================================================================
2. Error messages				*error-messages* *errors*

When an error message is displayed, but it is removed before you could read
it, you can see it again with: >
  :echo errmsg
or view a list of recent messages with: >
  :messages

This is an internal error.  If you can reproduce it, please send in a bug
report. |bugs|

>
  ATTENTION
  Found a swap file by the name ...

See |ATTENTION|.

							*E92*  >
  Buffer {N} not found

The buffer you requested does not exist.  This can also happen when you have
wiped out a buffer which contains a mark or is referenced in another way.
|:bwipeout|

							*E95*  >
  Buffer with this name already exists

You cannot have two buffers with the same name.

							*E72*  >
  Close error on swap file

The |swap-file|, that is used to keep a copy of the edited text, could not be
closed properly.  Mostly harmless.

							*E169*  >
  Command too recursive

This happens when an Ex command executes an Ex command that executes an Ex
command, etc.  This is only allowed 200 times.  When it's more there probably
is an endless loop.  Probably a |:execute| or |:source| command is involved.

							*E254*  >
  Cannot allocate color {name}

The color name {name} is unknown.  See |gui-colors| for a list of colors that
are available on most systems.

							*E458*  >
  Cannot allocate colormap entry, some colors may be incorrect

This means that there are not enough colors available for Vim.  It will still
run, but some of the colors will not appear in the specified color.  Try
stopping other applications that use many colors, or start them after starting
gvim.
Browsers are known to consume a lot of colors.  You can avoid this with
netscape by telling it to use its own colormap: >
	netscape -install
Or tell it to limit to a certain number of colors (64 should work well): >
	netscape -ncols 64
This can also be done with a line in your Xdefaults file: >
	Netscape*installColormap: Yes
or >
	Netscape*maxImageColors:  64
<
							*E79*  >
  Cannot expand wildcards

A filename contains a strange combination of characters, which causes Vim to
attempt expanding wildcards but this fails.  This does NOT mean that no
matching file names could be found, but that the pattern was illegal.

							*E459*  >
  Cannot go back to previous directory

While expanding a file name, Vim failed to go back to the previously used
directory.  All file names being used may be invalid now!  You need to have
execute permission on the current directory.

							*E190* *E212*  >
  Cannot open "{filename}" for writing
  Can't open file for writing

For some reason the file you are writing to cannot be created or overwritten.
The reason could be that you do not have permission to write in the directory
or the file name is not valid.

							*E166*  >
  Can't open linked file for writing

You are trying to write to a file which can't be overwritten, and the file is
a link (either a hard link or a symbolic link).  Writing might still be
possible if the directory that contains the link or the file is writable, but
Vim now doesn't know if you want to delete the link and write the file in its
place, or if you want to delete the file itself and write the new file in its
place.  If you really want to write the file under this name, you have to
manually delete the link or the file, or change the permissions so that Vim
can overwrite.

							*E46*  >
  Cannot change read-only variable "{name}"

You are trying to assign a value to an argument of a function |a:var| or a Vim
internal variable |v:var| which is read-only.

							*E90*  >
  Cannot unload last buffer

Vim always requires one buffer to be loaded, otherwise there would be nothing
to display in the window.

							*E40*  >
  Can't open errorfile <filename>

When using the ":make" or ":grep" commands: The file used to save the error
messages or grep output cannot be opened.  This can have several causes:
- 'shellredir' has a wrong value.
- The shell changes directory, causing the error file to be written in another
  directory.  This could be fixed by changing 'makeef', but then the make
  command is still executed in the wrong directory.
- 'makeef' has a wrong value.
- The 'grepprg' or 'makeprg' could not be executed.  This cannot always be
  detected (especially on MS-Windows).  Check your $PATH.

 >
  Can't open file C:\TEMP\VIoD243.TMP

On MS-Windows, this message appears when the output of an external command was
to be read, but the command didn't run successfully.  This can be caused by
many things.  Check the 'shell', 'shellquote', 'shellxquote', 'shellslash' and
related options.  It might also be that the external command was not found,
there is no different error message for that.

							*E12*  >
  Command not allowed from exrc/vimrc in current dir or tag search

Some commands are not allowed for security reasons.  These commands mostly
come from a .exrc or .vimrc file in the current directory, or from a tags
file.  Also see 'secure'.

							*E74*  >
  Command too complex

A mapping resulted in a very long command string.  Could be caused by a
mapping that indirectly calls itself.

>
  CONVERSION ERROR

When writing a file and the text "CONVERSION ERROR" appears, this means that
some bits were lost when converting text from the internally used UTF-8 to the
format of the file.  The file will not be marked unmodified.  If you care
about the loss of information, set the 'fileencoding' option to another value
that can handle the characters in the buffer and write again.  If you don't
care, you can abandon the buffer or reset the 'modified' option.

							*E302*  >
  Could not rename swap file

When the file name changes, Vim tries to rename the |swap-file| as well.
This failed and the old swap file is now still used.  Mostly harmless.

							*E43* *E44*  >
  Damaged match string
  Corrupted regexp program

Something inside Vim went wrong and resulted in a corrupted regexp.  If you
know how to reproduce this problem, please report it. |bugs|

							*E208* *E209* *E210*  >
  Error writing to "{filename}"
  Error closing "{filename}"
  Error reading "{filename}"

This occurs when Vim is trying to rename a file, but a simple change of file
name doesn't work.  Then the file will be copied, but somehow this failed.
The result may be that both the original file and the destination file exist
and the destination file may be incomplete.

>
  Vim: Error reading input, exiting...

This occurs when Vim cannot read typed characters while input is required.
Vim got stuck, the only thing it can do is exit.  This can happen when both
stdin and stderr are redirected and executing a script that doesn't exit Vim.

							*E47*  >
  Error while reading errorfile

Reading the error file was not possible.  This is NOT caused by an error
message that was not recognized.

							*E80*  >
  Error while writing

Writing a file was not completed successfully.  The file is probably
incomplete.

							*E13* *E189*  >
  File exists (add ! to override)
  "{filename}" exists (add ! to override)

You are protected from accidentally overwriting a file.  When you want to
write anyway, use the same command, but add a "!" just after the command.
Example: >
	:w /tmp/test
changes to: >
	:w! /tmp/test
<
							*E768*  >
  Swap file exists: {filename} (:silent! overrides)

You are protected from overwriting a file that is being edited by Vim.  This
happens when you use ":w! filename" and a swapfile is found.
- If the swapfile was left over from an old crashed edit session you may want
  to delete the swapfile.  Edit {filename} to find out information about the
  swapfile.
- If you want to write anyway prepend ":silent!" to the command.  For example: >
	:silent! w! /tmp/test
< The special command is needed, since you already added the ! for overwriting
  an existing file.

							*E139*  >
  File is loaded in another buffer

You are trying to write a file under a name which is also used in another
buffer.  This would result in two versions of the same file.

							*E142*  >
  File not written: Writing is disabled by 'write' option

The 'write' option is off.  This makes all commands that try to write a file
generate this message.  This could be caused by a |-m| commandline argument.
You can switch the 'write' option on with ":set write".

							*E25*  >
  GUI cannot be used: Not enabled at compile time

You are running a version of Vim that doesn't include the GUI code.  Therefore
"gvim" and ":gui" don't work.

							*E49*  >
  Invalid scroll size

This is caused by setting an invalid value for the 'scroll', 'scrolljump' or
'scrolloff' options.

							*E17*  >
  "{filename}" is a directory

You tried to write a file with the name of a directory.  This is not possible.
You probably need to append a file name.

							*E19*  >
  Mark has invalid line number

You are using a mark that has a line number that doesn't exist.  This can
happen when you have a mark in another file, and some other program has
deleted lines from it.

							*E219* *E220*  >
  Missing {.
  Missing }.

Using a {} construct in a file name, but there is a { without a matching } or
the other way around.  It should be used like this: {foo,bar}.  This matches
"foo" and "bar".

							*E315*  >
  ml_get: invalid lnum: {number}

This is an internal Vim error.  Please try to find out how it can be
reproduced, and submit a bug report |bugreport.vim|.

							*E173*  >
  {number} more files to edit

You are trying to exit, while the last item in the argument list has not been
edited.  This protects you from accidentally exiting when you still have more
files to work on.  See |argument-list|.  If you do want to exit, just do it
again and it will work.

							*E23* *E194*  >
  No alternate file
  No alternate file name to substitute for '#'

The alternate file is not defined yet.  See |alternate-file|.

							*E32*  >
  No file name

The current buffer has no name.  To write it, use ":w fname".  Or give the
buffer a name with ":file fname".

							*E141*  >
  No file name for buffer {number}

One of the buffers that was changed does not have a file name.  Therefore it
cannot be written.  You need to give the buffer a file name: >
	:buffer {number}
	:file {filename}
<
							*E33*  >
  No previous substitute regular expression

When using the '~' character in a pattern, it is replaced with the previously
used pattern in a ":substitute" command.  This fails when no such command has
been used yet.  See |/~|.  This also happens when using ":s/pat/%/", where the
"%" stands for the previous substitute string.

							*E35*  >
  No previous regular expression

When using an empty search pattern, the previous search pattern is used.  But
that is not possible if there was no previous search.

							*E24*  >
  No such abbreviation

You have used an ":unabbreviate" command with an argument which is not an
existing abbreviation.  All variations of this command give the same message:
":cunabbrev", ":iunabbrev", etc.  Check for trailing white space.

>
  /dev/dsp: No such file or directory

Only given for GTK GUI with Gnome support.  Gnome tries to use the audio
device and it isn't present.  You can ignore this error.

							*E31*  >
  No such mapping

You have used an ":unmap" command with an argument which is not an existing
mapping.  All variations of this command give the same message: ":cunmap",
":unmap!", etc.  A few hints:
- Check for trailing white space.
- If the mapping is buffer-local you need to use ":unmap <buffer>".
  |:map-<buffer>|

							*E37* *E89*  >
  No write since last change (add ! to override)
  No write since last change for buffer {N} (add ! to override)

You are trying to |abandon| a file that has changes.  Vim protects you from
losing your work.  You can either write the changed file with ":w", or, if you
are sure, |abandon| it anyway, and lose all the changes.  This can be done by
adding a '!' character just after the command you used.  Example: >
	:e other_file
changes to: >
	:e! other_file
<
							*E162*  >
  No write since last change for buffer "{name}"

This appears when you try to exit Vim while some buffers are changed.  You
will either have to write the changed buffer (with |:w|), or use a command to
abandon the buffer forcefully, e.g., with ":qa!".  Careful, make sure you
don't throw away changes you really want to keep.  You might have forgotten
about a buffer, especially when 'hidden' is set.

>
  [No write since last change]

This appears when executing a shell command while at least one buffer was
changed.  To avoid the message reset the 'warn' option.

							*E38*  >
  Null argument

Something inside Vim went wrong and resulted in a NULL pointer.  If you know
how to reproduce this problem, please report it. |bugs|

							*E172*  >
  Only one file name allowed

The ":edit" command only accepts one file name.  When you want to specify
several files for editing use ":next" |:next|.

						*E41* *E82* *E83* *E342*  >
  Out of memory!
  Out of memory!  (allocating {number} bytes)
  Cannot allocate any buffer, exiting...
  Cannot allocate buffer, using other one...

Oh, oh.  You must have been doing something complicated, or some other program
is consuming your memory.  Be careful!  Vim is not completely prepared for an
out-of-memory situation.  First make sure that any changes are saved.  Then
try to solve the memory shortage.  To stay on the safe side, exit Vim and
start again.

Buffers are only partly kept in memory, thus editing a very large file is
unlikely to cause an out-of-memory situation.  Undo information is completely
in memory, you can reduce that with these options:
- 'undolevels'  Set to a low value, or to -1 to disable undo completely.  This
  helps for a change that affects all lines.
- 'undoreload' Set to zero to disable.

Also see |msdos-limitations|.

							*E339*  >
  Pattern too long

This happens on systems with 16 bit ints: The compiled regexp pattern is
longer than about 65000 characters.  Try using a shorter pattern.
It also happens when the offset of a rule doesn't fit in the space available.
Try simplifying the pattern.

							*E45*  >
  'readonly' option is set (add ! to override)

You are trying to write a file that was marked as read-only.  To write the
file anyway, either reset the 'readonly' option, or add a '!' character just
after the command you used.  Example: >
	:w
changes to: >
	:w!
<
							*E294* *E295* *E301*  >
  Read error in swap file
  Seek error in swap file read
  Oops, lost the swap file!!!

Vim tried to read text from the |swap-file|, but something went wrong.  The
text in the related buffer may now be corrupted!  Check carefully before you
write a buffer.  You may want to write it in another file and check for
differences.

							*E192*  >
  Recursive use of :normal too deep

You are using a ":normal" command, whose argument again uses a ":normal"
command in a recursive way.  This is restricted to 'maxmapdepth' levels.  This
example illustrates how to get this message: >
	:map gq :normal gq<CR>
If you type "gq", it will execute this mapping, which will call "gq" again.

							*E22*  >
  Scripts nested too deep

Scripts can be read with the "-s" command-line argument and with the ":source"
command.  The script can then again read another script.  This can continue
for about 14 levels.  When more nesting is done, Vim assumes that there is a
recursive loop somewhere and stops with this error message.

							*E319*  >
  Sorry, the command is not available in this version

You have used a command that is not present in the version of Vim you are
using.  When compiling Vim, many different features can be enabled or
disabled.  This depends on how big Vim has chosen to be and the operating
system.  See |+feature-list| for when which feature is available.  The
|:version| command shows which feature Vim was compiled with.

							*E300*  >
  Swap file already exists (symlink attack?)

This message appears when Vim is trying to open a swap file and finds it
already exists or finds a symbolic link in its place.  This shouldn't happen,
because Vim already checked that the file doesn't exist.  Either someone else
opened the same file at exactly the same moment (very unlikely) or someone is
attempting a symlink attack (could happen when editing a file in /tmp or when
'directory' starts with "/tmp", which is a bad choice).

							*E432*  >
  Tags file not sorted: {file name}

Vim (and Vi) expect tags files to be sorted in ASCII order.  Binary searching
can then be used, which is a lot faster than a linear search.  If your tags
files are not properly sorted, reset the |'tagbsearch'| option.
This message is only given when Vim detects a problem when searching for a
tag.  Sometimes this message is not given, even though the tags file is not
properly sorted.

							*E460*  >
  The resource fork would be lost (add ! to override)

On the Macintosh (classic), when writing a file, Vim attempts to preserve all
info about a file, including its resource fork.  If this is not possible you
get this error message.  Append "!" to the command name to write anyway (and
lose the info).

							*E424*  >
  Too many different highlighting attributes in use

Vim can only handle about 223 different kinds of highlighting.  If you run
into this limit, you have used too many |:highlight| commands with different
arguments.  A ":highlight link" is not counted.

							*E77*  >
  Too many file names

When expanding file names, more than one match was found.  Only one match is
allowed for the command that was used.

							*E303*  >
  Unable to open swap file for "{filename}", recovery impossible

Vim was not able to create a swap file.  You can still edit the file, but if
Vim unexpectedly exits the changes will be lost.  And Vim may consume a lot of
memory when editing a big file.  You may want to change the 'directory' option
to avoid this error.  See |swap-file|.

							*E140*  >
  Use ! to write partial buffer

When using a range to write part of a buffer, it is unusual to overwrite the
original file.  It is probably a mistake (e.g., when Visual mode was active
when using ":w"), therefore Vim requires using a !  after the command, e.g.:
":3,10w!".
>

  Warning: Cannot convert string "<Key>Escape,_Key_Cancel" to type

							*W10*  >
  Warning: Changing a readonly file

The file is read-only and you are making a change to it anyway.  You can use
the |FileChangedRO| autocommand event to avoid this message (the autocommand
must reset the 'readonly' option).  See 'modifiable' to completely disallow
making changes to a file.
This message is only given for the first change after 'readonly' has been set.

							*W13*  >
  Warning: File "{filename}" has been created after editing started

You are editing a file in Vim when it didn't exist, but it does exist now.
You will have to decide if you want to keep the version in Vim or the newly
created file.  This message is not given when 'buftype' is not empty.

							*W11*  >
  Warning: File "{filename}" has changed since editing started

The file which you have started editing has got another timestamp and the
contents changed (more precisely: When reading the file again with the current
option settings and autocommands you would end up with different text).  This
probably means that some other program changed the file.  You will have to
find out what happened, and decide which version of the file you want to keep.
Set the 'autoread' option if you want to do this automatically.
This message is not given when 'buftype' is not empty.

There is one situation where you get this message even though there is nothing
wrong: If you save a file in Windows on the day the daylight saving time
starts.  It can be fixed in one of these ways:
- Add this line in your autoexec.bat: >
	   SET TZ=-1
< Adjust the "-1" for your time zone.
- Disable "automatically adjust clock for daylight saving changes".
- Just write the file again the next day.  Or set your clock to the next day,
  write the file twice and set the clock back.

							*W12*  >
  Warning: File "{filename}" has changed and the buffer was changed in Vim as well

Like the above, and the buffer for the file was changed in this Vim as well.
You will have to decide if you want to keep the version in this Vim or the one
on disk.  This message is not given when 'buftype' is not empty.

							*W16*  >
  Warning: Mode of file "{filename}" has changed since editing started

When the timestamp for a buffer was changed and the contents are still the
same but the mode (permissions) have changed.  This usually occurs when
checking out a file from a version control system, which causes the read-only
bit to be reset.  It should be safe to reload the file.  Set 'autoread' to
automatically reload the file.

							*E211*  >
  File "{filename}" no longer available

The file which you have started editing has disappeared, or is no longer
accessible.  Make sure you write the buffer somewhere to avoid losing
changes.  This message is not given when 'buftype' is not empty.

							*W14*  >
  Warning: List of file names overflow

You must be using an awful lot of buffers.  It's now possible that two buffers
have the same number, which causes various problems.  You might want to exit
Vim and restart it.

							*E296* *E297*  >
  Seek error in swap file write
  Write error in swap file

This mostly happens when the disk is full.  Vim could not write text into the
|swap-file|.  It's not directly harmful, but when Vim unexpectedly exits some
text may be lost without recovery being possible.  Vim might run out of memory
when this problem persists.

						*connection-refused*  >
  Xlib: connection to "<machine-name:0.0" refused by server

This happens when Vim tries to connect to the X server, but the X server does
not allow a connection.  The connection to the X server is needed to be able
to restore the title and for the xterm clipboard support.  Unfortunately this
error message cannot be avoided, except by disabling the |+xterm_clipboard|
and |+X11| features.

							*E10*  >
  \\ should be followed by /, ? or &

A command line started with a backslash or the range of a command contained a
backslash in a wrong place.  This is often caused by command-line continuation
being disabled.  Remove the 'C' flag from the 'cpoptions' option to enable it.
Or use ":set nocp".

Vim cannot create a temporary file.

							*E484* *E485*  >
  Can't open file {filename}
  Can't read file {filename}

Vim cannot read a temporary file.  Especially on Windows, this can be caused
by wrong escaping of special characters for cmd.exe; the approach was
changed with patch 7.3.443.  Try using |shellescape()| for all shell arguments
given to |system()|, or explicitly add escaping with ^.  Also see
'shellxquote' and 'shellxescape'.

3. Messages						*messages*

This is an (incomplete) overview of various messages that Vim gives:

			*hit-enter* *press-enter* *hit-return*
			*press-return* *hit-enter-prompt*

  Press ENTER or type command to continue

This message is given when there is something on the screen for you to read,
and the screen is about to be redrawn:
- After executing an external command (e.g., ":!ls" and "=").
- Something is displayed on the status line that is longer than the width of
  the window, or runs into the 'showcmd' or 'ruler' output.

-> Press <Enter> or <Space> to redraw the screen and continue, without that
   key being used otherwise.
-> Press ':' or any other Normal mode command character to start that command.
-> Press 'k', <Up>, 'u', 'b' or 'g' to scroll back in the messages.  This
   works the same way as at the |more-prompt|.  Only works when 'compatible'
   is off and 'more' is on.
-> Pressing 'j', 'f', 'd' or <Down> is ignored when messages scrolled off the
   top of the screen, 'compatible' is off and 'more' is on, to avoid that
   typing one 'j' or 'f' too many causes the messages to disappear.
-> Press <C-Y> to copy (yank) a modeless selection to the clipboard register.
-> Use a menu.  The characters defined for Cmdline-mode are used.
-> When 'mouse' contains the 'r' flag, clicking the left mouse button works
   like pressing <Space>.  This makes it impossible to select text though.
-> For the GUI clicking the left mouse button in the last line works like
   pressing <Space>.
{Vi: only ":" commands are interpreted}

If you accidentally hit <Enter> or <Space> and you want to see the displayed
text then use |g<|.  This only works when 'more' is set.

To reduce the number of hit-enter prompts:
- Set 'cmdheight' to 2 or higher.
- Add flags to 'shortmess'.
- Reset 'showcmd' and/or 'ruler'.

If your script causes the hit-enter prompt and you don't know why, you may
find the |v:scrollstart| variable useful.

Also see 'mouse'.  The hit-enter message is highlighted with the |hl-Question|
group.


						*more-prompt* *pager*  >
  -- More --
  -- More -- SPACE/d/j: screen/page/line down, b/u/k: up, q: quit

This message is given when the screen is filled with messages.  It is only
given when the 'more' option is on.  It is highlighted with the |hl-MoreMsg|
group.

Type					effect ~
     <CR> or <NL> or j or <Down>	one more line
     d					down a page (half a screen)
     <Space> or f or <PageDown>		down a screen
     G					down all the way, until the hit-enter
					prompt

     <BS> or k or <Up>			one line back (*)
     u					up a page (half a screen) (*)
     b or <PageUp>			back a screen (*)
     g					back to the start (*)

     q, <Esc> or CTRL-C			stop the listing
     :					stop the listing and enter a
					     command-line
    <C-Y>				yank (copy) a modeless selection to
					the clipboard ("* and "+ registers)
    {menu-entry}			what the menu is defined to in
					Cmdline-mode.
    <LeftMouse> (**)			next page

Any other key causes the meaning of the keys to be displayed.

(*)  backwards scrolling is {not in Vi}.  Only scrolls back to where messages
     started to scroll.
(**) Clicking the left mouse button only works:
     - For the GUI: in the last line of the screen.
     - When 'r' is included in 'mouse' (but then selecting text won't work).


Note: The typed key is directly obtained from the terminal, it is not mapped
and typeahead is ignored.

The |g<| command can be used to see the last page of previous command output.
This is especially useful if you accidentally typed <Space> at the hit-enter

			     Making big changes


In chapter 4 several ways to make small changes were explained.  This chapter
goes into making changes that are repeated or can affect a large amount of
text.  The Visual mode allows doing various things with blocks of text.  Use
an external program to do really complicated things.

|10.1|	Record and playback commands
|10.2|	Substitution
|10.3|	Command ranges
|10.4|	The global command
|10.5|	Visual block mode
|10.6|	Reading and writing part of a file
|10.7|	Formatting text
|10.8|	Changing case
|10.9|	Using an external program

==============================================================================
*10.1*	Record and playback commands

The "." command repeats the preceding change.  But what if you want to do
something more complex than a single change?  That's where command recording
comes in.  There are three steps:

1. The "q{register}" command starts recording keystrokes into the register
   named {register}.  The register name must be between a and z.
2. Type your commands.
3. To finish recording, press q (without any extra character).

You can now execute the macro by typing the command "@{register}".

Take a look at how to use these commands in practice.  You have a list of
filenames that look like this:

	stdio.h ~
	fcntl.h ~
	unistd.h ~
	stdlib.h ~

And what you want is the following:

	#include "stdio.h" ~
	#include "fcntl.h" ~
	#include "unistd.h" ~
	#include "stdlib.h" ~

You start by moving to the first character of the first line.  Next you
execute the following commands:

	qa			Start recording a macro in register a.
	^			Move to the beginning of the line.
	i#include "<Esc>	Insert the string #include " at the beginning
				of the line.
	$			Move to the end of the line.
	a"<Esc>			Append the character double quotation mark (")
				to the end of the line.
	j			Go to the next line.
	q			Stop recording the macro.

Now that you have done the work once, you can repeat the change by typing the
command "@a" three times.
   The "@a" command can be preceded by a count, which will cause the macro to
be executed that number of times.  In this case you would type: >

	3@a


MOVE AND EXECUTE

You might have the lines you want to change in various places.  Just move the
cursor to each location and use the "@a" command.  If you have done that once,
you can do it again with "@@".  That's a bit easier to type.  If you now
execute register b with "@b", the next "@@" will use register b.
   If you compare the playback method with using ".", there are several
differences.  First of all, "." can only repeat one change.  As seen in the
example above, "@a" can do several changes, and move around as well.
Secondly, "." can only remember the last change.  Executing a register allows
you to make any changes and then still use "@a" to replay the recorded
commands.  Finally, you can use 26 different registers.  Thus you can remember
26 different command sequences to execute.


USING REGISTERS

The registers used for recording are the same ones you used for yank and
delete commands.  This allows you to mix recording with other commands to
manipulate the registers.
   Suppose you have recorded a few commands in register n.  When you execute
this with "@n" you notice you did something wrong.  You could try recording
again, but perhaps you will make another mistake.  Instead, use this trick:

	G			Go to the end of the file.
	o<Esc>			Create an empty line.
	"np			Put the text from the n register.  You now see
				the commands you typed as text in the file.
	{edits}			Change the commands that were wrong.  This is
				just like editing text.
	0			Go to the start of the line.
	"ny$			Yank the corrected commands into the n
				register.
	dd			Delete the scratch line.

Now you can execute the corrected commands with "@n".  (If your recorded
commands include line breaks, adjust the last two items in the example to
include all the lines.)


APPENDING TO A REGISTER

So far we have used a lowercase letter for the register name.  To append to a
register, use an uppercase letter.
   Suppose you have recorded a command to change a word to register c.  It
works properly, but you would like to add a search for the next word to
change.  This can be done with: >

	qC/word<Enter>q

You start with "qC", which records to the c register and appends.  Thus
writing to an uppercase register name means to append to the register with
the same letter, but lowercase.

This works both with recording and with yank and delete commands.  For
example, you want to collect a sequence of lines into the a register.  Yank
the first line with: >

	"aY

Now move to the second line, and type: >

	"AY

Repeat this command for all lines.  The a register now contains all those
lines, in the order you yanked them.

==============================================================================
*10.2*	Substitution						*find-replace*

The ":substitute" command enables you to perform string replacements on a
whole range of lines.  The general form of this command is as follows: >

	:[range]substitute/from/to/[flags]

This command changes the "from" string to the "to" string in the lines
specified with [range].  For example, you can change "Professor" to "Teacher"
in all lines with the following command: >

	:%substitute/Professor/Teacher/
<
	Note:
	The ":substitute" command is almost never spelled out completely.
	Most of the time, people use the abbreviated version ":s".  From here
	on the abbreviation will be used.

The "%" before the command specifies the command works on all lines.  Without
a range, ":s" only works on the current line.  More about ranges in the next
section |10.3|.

By default, the ":substitute" command changes only the first occurrence on
each line.  For example, the preceding command changes the line:

	Professor Smith criticized Professor Johnson today. ~

to:

	Teacher Smith criticized Professor Johnson today. ~

To change every occurrence on the line, you need to add the g (global) flag.
The command: >

	:%s/Professor/Teacher/g

results in (starting with the original line):

	Teacher Smith criticized Teacher Johnson today. ~

Other flags include p (print), which causes the ":substitute" command to print
out the last line it changes.  The c (confirm) flag tells ":substitute" to ask
you for confirmation before it performs each substitution.  Enter the
following: >

	:%s/Professor/Teacher/c

Vim finds the first occurrence of "Professor" and displays the text it is
about to change.  You get the following prompt: >

	replace with Teacher (y/n/a/q/l/^E/^Y)?

At this point, you must enter one of the following answers:

	y		Yes; make this change.
	n		No; skip this match.
	a		All; make this change and all remaining ones without
			further confirmation.
	q		Quit; don't make any more changes.
	l		Last; make this change and then quit.
	CTRL-E		Scroll the text one line up.
	CTRL-Y		Scroll the text one line down.


The "from" part of the substitute command is actually a pattern.  The same
kind as used for the search command.  For example, this command only
substitutes "the" when it appears at the start of a line: >

	:s/^the/these/

If you are substituting with a "from" or "to" part that includes a slash, you
need to put a backslash before it.  A simpler way is to use another character
instead of the slash.  A plus, for example: >

	:s+one/two+one or two+

==============================================================================
*10.3*	Command ranges

The ":substitute" command, and many other : commands, can be applied to a
selection of lines.  This is called a range.
   The simple form of a range is {number},{number}.  For example: >

	:1,5s/this/that/g

Executes the substitute command on the lines 1 to 5.  Line 5 is included.
The range is always placed before the command.

A single number can be used to address one specific line: >

	:54s/President/Fool/

Some commands work on the whole file when you do not specify a range.  To make
them work on the current line the "." address is used.  The ":write" command
works like that.  Without a range, it writes the whole file.  To make it write
only the current line into a file: >

	:.write otherfile

The first line always has number one.  How about the last line?  The "$"
character is used for this.  For example, to substitute in the lines from the
cursor to the end: >

	:.,$s/yes/no/

The "%" range that we used before, is actually a short way to say "1,$", from
the first to the last line.


USING A PATTERN IN A RANGE

Suppose you are editing a chapter in a book, and want to replace all
occurrences of "grey" with "gray".  But only in this chapter, not in the next
one.  You know that only chapter boundaries have the word "Chapter" in the
first column.  This command will work then: >

	:?^Chapter?,/^Chapter/s=grey=gray=g

You can see a search pattern is used twice.  The first "?^Chapter?" finds the
line above the current position that matches this pattern.  Thus the ?pattern?
range is used to search backwards.  Similarly, "/^Chapter/" is used to search
forward for the start of the next chapter.
   To avoid confusion with the slashes, the "=" character was used in the
substitute command here.  A slash or another character would have worked as
well.


ADD AND SUBTRACT

There is a slight error in the above command: If the title of the next chapter
had included "grey" it would be replaced as well.  Maybe that's what you
wanted, but what if you didn't?  Then you can specify an offset.
   To search for a pattern and then use the line above it: >

	/Chapter/-1

You can use any number instead of the 1.  To address the second line below the
match: >

	/Chapter/+2

The offsets can also be used with the other items in a range.  Look at this
one: >

	:.+3,$-5

This specifies the range that starts three lines below the cursor and ends
five lines before the last line in the file.


USING MARKS

Instead of figuring out the line numbers of certain positions, remembering them
and typing them in a range, you can use marks.
   Place the marks as mentioned in chapter 3.  For example, use "mt" to mark
the top of an area and "mb" to mark the bottom.  Then you can use this range
to specify the lines between the marks (including the lines with the marks): >

	:'t,'b


VISUAL MODE AND RANGES

You can select text with Visual mode.  If you then press ":" to start a colon
command, you will see this: >

	:'<,'>

Now you can type the command and it will be applied to the range of lines that
was visually selected.

	Note:
	When using Visual mode to select part of a line, or using CTRL-V to
	select a block of text, the colon commands will still apply to whole
	lines.  This might change in a future version of Vim.

The '< and '> are actually marks, placed at the start and end of the Visual
selection.  The marks remain at their position until another Visual selection
is made.  Thus you can use the "'<" command to jump to position where the
Visual area started.  And you can mix the marks with other items: >

	:'>,$

This addresses the lines from the end of the Visual area to the end of the
file.


A NUMBER OF LINES

When you know how many lines you want to change, you can type the number and
then ":".  For example, when you type "5:", you will get: >

	:.,.+4

Now you can type the command you want to use.  It will use the range "."
(current line) until ".+4" (four lines down).  Thus it spans five lines.

==============================================================================
*10.4*	The global command

The ":global" command is one of the more powerful features of Vim.  It allows
you to find a match for a pattern and execute a command there.  The general
form is: >

	:[range]global/{pattern}/{command}

This is similar to the ":substitute" command.  But, instead of replacing the
matched text with other text, the command {command} is executed.

	Note:
	The command executed for ":global" must be one that starts with a
	colon.  Normal mode commands can not be used directly.  The |:normal|
	command can do this for you.

Suppose you want to change "foobar" to "barfoo", but only in C++ style
comments.  These comments start with "//".  Use this command: >

	:g+//+s/foobar/barfoo/g

This starts with ":g".  That is short for ":global", just like ":s" is short
for ":substitute".  Then the pattern, enclosed in plus characters.  Since the
pattern we are looking for contains a slash, this uses the plus character to
separate the pattern.  Next comes the substitute command that changes "foobar"
into "barfoo".
   The default range for the global command is the whole file.  Thus no range
was specified in this example.  This is different from ":substitute", which
works on one line without a range.
   The command isn't perfect, since it also matches lines where "//" appears
halfway a line, and the substitution will also take place before the "//".

Just like with ":substitute", any pattern can be used.  When you learn more
complicated patterns later, you can use them here.

==============================================================================
*10.5*	Visual block mode

With CTRL-V you can start selection of a rectangular area of text.  There are
a few commands that do something special with the text block.

There is something special about using the "$" command in Visual block mode.
When the last motion command used was "$", all lines in the Visual selection
will extend until the end of the line, also when the line with the cursor is
shorter.  This remains effective until you use a motion command that moves the
cursor horizontally.  Thus using "j" keeps it, "h" stops it.


INSERTING TEXT

The command  "I{string}<Esc>" inserts the text {string} in each line, just
left of the visual block.  You start by pressing CTRL-V to enter visual block
mode.  Now you move the cursor to define your block.  Next you type I to enter
Insert mode, followed by the text to insert.  As you type, the text appears on
the first line only.
   After you press <Esc> to end the insert, the text will magically be
inserted in the rest of the lines contained in the visual selection.  Example:

	include one ~
	include two ~
	include three ~
	include four ~

Move the cursor to the "o" of "one" and press CTRL-V.  Move it down with "3j"
to "four".  You now have a block selection that spans four lines.  Now type: >

	Imain.<Esc>

The result:

	include main.one ~
	include main.two ~
	include main.three ~
	include main.four ~

If the block spans short lines that do not extend into the block, the text is
not inserted in that line.  For example, make a Visual block selection that
includes the word "long" in the first and last line of this text, and thus has
no text selected in the second line:

	This is a long line ~
	short ~
	Any other long line ~

		  ^^^^ selected block

Now use the command "Ivery <Esc>".  The result is:

	This is a very long line ~
	short ~
	Any other very long line ~

In the short line no text was inserted.

If the string you insert contains a newline, the "I" acts just like a Normal
insert command and affects only the first line of the block.

The "A" command works the same way, except that it appends after the right
side of the block.  And it does insert text in a short line.  Thus you can
make a choice whether you do or don't want to append text to a short line.
   There is one special case for "A": Select a Visual block and then use "$"
to make the block extend to the end of each line.  Using "A" now will append
the text to the end of each line.
   Using the same example from above, and then typing "$A XXX<Esc>, you get
this result:

	This is a long line XXX ~
	short XXX ~
	Any other long line XXX ~

This really requires using the "$" command.  Vim remembers that it was used.
Making the same selection by moving the cursor to the end of the longest line
with other movement commands will not have the same result.


CHANGING TEXT

The Visual block "c" command deletes the block and then throws you into Insert
mode to enable you to type in a string.  The string will be inserted in each
line in the block.
   Starting with the same selection of the "long" words as above, then typing
"c_LONG_<Esc>", you get this:

	This is a _LONG_ line ~
	short ~
	Any other _LONG_ line ~

Just like with "I" the short line is not changed.  Also, you can't enter a
newline in the new text.

The "C" command deletes text from the left edge of the block to the end of
line.  It then puts you in Insert mode so that you can type in a string,
which is added to the end of each line.
   Starting with the same text again, and typing "Cnew text<Esc>" you get:

	This is a new text ~
	short ~
	Any other new text ~

Notice that, even though only the "long" word was selected, the text after it
is deleted as well.  Thus only the location of the left edge of the visual
block really matters.
   Again, short lines that do not reach into the block are excluded.

Other commands that change the characters in the block:

	~	swap case	(a -> A and A -> a)
	U	make uppercase  (a -> A and A -> A)
	u	make lowercase  (a -> a and A -> a)


FILLING WITH A CHARACTER

To fill the whole block with one character, use the "r" command.  Again,
starting with the same example text from above, and then typing "rx":

	This is a xxxx line ~
	short ~
	Any other xxxx line ~


	Note:
	If you want to include characters beyond the end of the line in the
	block, check out the 'virtualedit' feature in chapter 25.


SHIFTING

The command ">" shifts the selected text to the right one shift amount,
inserting whitespace.  The starting point for this shift is the left edge of
the visual block.
   With the same example again, ">" gives this result:

	This is a	  long line ~
	short ~
	Any other	  long line ~

The shift amount is specified with the 'shiftwidth' option.  To change it to
use 4 spaces: >

	:set shiftwidth=4

The "<" command removes one shift amount of whitespace at the left
edge of the block.  This command is limited by the amount of text that is
there; so if there is less than a shift amount of whitespace available, it
removes what it can.


JOINING LINES

The "J" command joins all selected lines together into one line.  Thus it
removes the line breaks.  Actually, the line break, leading white space and
trailing white space is replaced by one space.  Two spaces are used after a
line ending (that can be changed with the 'joinspaces' option).
   Let's use the example that we got so familiar with now.  The result of
using the "J" command:

	This is a long line short Any other long line ~

The "J" command doesn't require a blockwise selection.  It works with "v" and
"V" selection in exactly the same way.

If you don't want the white space to be changed, use the "gJ" command.

==============================================================================
*10.6*	Reading and writing part of a file

When you are writing an e-mail message, you may want to include another file.
This can be done with the ":read {filename}" command.  The text of the file is
put below the cursor line.
   Starting with this text:

	Hi John, ~
	Here is the diff that fixes the bug: ~
	Bye, Pierre. ~

Move the cursor to the second line and type: >

	:read patch

The file named "patch" will be inserted, with this result:

	Hi John, ~
	Here is the diff that fixes the bug: ~
	2c2 ~
	<	for (i = 0; i <= length; ++i) ~
	--- ~
	>	for (i = 0; i < length; ++i) ~
	Bye, Pierre. ~

The ":read" command accepts a range.  The file will be put below the last line
number of this range.  Thus ":$r patch" appends the file "patch" at the end of
the file.
   What if you want to read the file above the first line?  This can be done
with the line number zero.  This line doesn't really exist, you will get an
error message when using it with most commands.  But this command is allowed:
>
	:0read patch

The file "patch" will be put above the first line of the file.


WRITING A RANGE OF LINES

To write a range of lines to a file, the ":write" command can be used.
Without a range it writes the whole file.  With a range only the specified
lines are written: >

	:.,$write tempo

This writes the lines from the cursor until the end of the file into the file
"tempo".  If this file already exists you will get an error message.  Vim
protects you from accidentally overwriting an existing file.  If you know what
you are doing and want to overwrite the file, append !: >

	:.,$write! tempo

CAREFUL: The ! must follow the ":write" command immediately, without white
space.  Otherwise it becomes a filter command, which is explained later in
this chapter.


APPENDING TO A FILE

In the first section of this chapter was explained how to collect a number of
lines into a register.  The same can be done to collect lines in a file.
Write the first line with this command: >

	:.write collection

Now move the cursor to the second line you want to collect, and type this: >

	:.write >>collection

The ">>" tells Vim the "collection" file is not to be written as a new file,
but the line must be appended at the end.   You can repeat this as many times
as you like.

==============================================================================
*10.7*	Formatting text

When you are typing plain text, it's nice if the length of each line is
automatically trimmed to fit in the window.  To make this happen while
inserting text, set the 'textwidth' option: >

	:set textwidth=72

You might remember that in the example vimrc file this command was used for
every text file.  Thus if you are using that vimrc file, you were already
using it.  To check the current value of 'textwidth': >

	:set textwidth

Now lines will be broken to take only up to 72 characters.  But when you
insert text halfway a line, or when you delete a few words, the lines will get
too long or too short.  Vim doesn't automatically reformat the text.
   To tell Vim to format the current paragraph: >

	gqap

This starts with the "gq" command, which is an operator.  Following is "ap",
the text object that stands for "a paragraph".  A paragraph is separated from
the next paragraph by an empty line.

	Note:
	A blank line, which contains white space, does NOT separate
	paragraphs.  This is hard to notice!

Instead of "ap" you could use any motion or text object.  If your paragraphs
are properly separated, you can use this command to format the whole file: >

	gggqG

"gg" takes you to the first line, "gq" is the format operator and "G" the
motion that jumps to the last line.

In case your paragraphs aren't clearly defined, you can format just the lines
you manually select.  Move the cursor to the first line you want to format.
Start with the command "gqj".  This formats the current line and the one below
it.  If the first line was short, words from the next line will be appended.
If it was too long, words will be moved to the next line.  The cursor moves to
the second line.  Now you can use "." to repeat the command.  Keep doing this
until you are at the end of the text you want to format.

==============================================================================
*10.8*	Changing case

You have text with section headers in lowercase.  You want to make the word
"section" all uppercase.  Do this with the "gU" operator.  Start with the
cursor in the first column: >

			     gUw
<	section header	    ---->      SECTION header

The "gu" operator does exactly the opposite: >

			     guw
<	SECTION header	    ---->      section header

You can also use "g~" to swap case.  All these are operators, thus they work
with any motion command, with text objects and in Visual mode.
   To make an operator work on lines you double it.  The delete operator is
"d", thus to delete a line you use "dd".  Similarly, "gugu" makes a whole line
lowercase.  This can be shortened to "guu".  "gUgU" is shortened to "gUU" and
"g~g~" to "g~~".  Example: >

				g~~ 
<	Some GIRLS have Fun    ---->   sOME girls HAVE fUN ~

==============================================================================
*10.9*	Using an external program

Vim has a very powerful set of commands, it can do anything.  But there may
still be something that an external command can do better or faster.
   The command "!{motion}{program}" takes a block of text and filters it
through an external program.  In other words, it runs the system command
represented by {program}, giving it the block of text represented by {motion}
as input.  The output of this command then replaces the selected block.
   Because this summarizes badly if you are unfamiliar with UNIX filters, take
a look at an example.  The sort command sorts a file.  If you execute the
following command, the unsorted file input.txt will be sorted and written to
output.txt.  (This works on both UNIX and Microsoft Windows.) >

	sort <input.txt >output.txt

Now do the same thing in Vim.  You want to sort lines 1 through 5 of a file.
You start by putting the cursor on line 1.  Next you execute the following
command: >

	!5G

The "!" tells Vim that you are performing a filter operation.  The Vim editor
expects a motion command to follow, indicating which part of the file to
filter.  The "5G" command tells Vim to go to line 5, so it now knows that it
is to filter lines 1 (the current line) through 5.
   In anticipation of the filtering, the cursor drops to the bottom of the
screen and a ! prompt displays.  You can now type in the name of the filter
program, in this case "sort".  Therefore, your full command is as follows: >

	!5Gsort<Enter>

The result is that the sort program is run on the first 5 lines.  The output
of the program replaces these lines.

	line 55			      line 11
	line 33			      line 22
	line 11		-->	      line 33
	line 22			      line 44
	line 44			      line 55
	last line		      last line

The "!!" command filters the current line through a filter.  In Unix the "date"
command prints the current time and date.  "!!date<Enter>" replaces the current
line with the output of "date".  This is useful to add a timestamp to a file.


WHEN IT DOESN'T WORK

Starting a shell, sending it text and capturing the output requires that Vim
knows how the shell works exactly.  When you have problems with filtering,
check the values of these options:

	'shell'		specifies the program that Vim uses to execute
			external programs.
	'shellcmdflag'	argument to pass a command to the shell
	'shellquote'	quote to be used around the command
	'shellxquote'	quote to be used around the command and redirection
	'shelltype'	kind of shell (only for the Amiga)
	'shellslash'	use forward slashes in the command (only for
			MS-Windows and alikes)
	'shellredir'	string used to write the command output into a file

On Unix this is hardly ever a problem, because there are two kinds of shells:
"sh" like and "csh" like.  Vim checks the 'shell' option and sets related
options automatically, depending on whether it sees "csh" somewhere in
'shell'.
   On MS-Windows, however, there are many different shells and you might have
to tune the options to make filtering work.  Check the help for the options
for more information.


READING COMMAND OUTPUT

To read the contents of the current directory into the file, use this:

on Unix: >
	:read !ls
on MS-Windows: >
	:read !dir

The output of the "ls" or "dir" command is captured and inserted in the text,
below the cursor.  This is similar to reading a file, except that the "!" is
used to tell Vim that a command follows.
   The command may have arguments.  And a range can be used to tell where Vim
should put the lines: >

	:0read !date -u

This inserts the current time and date in UTC format at the top of the file.
(Well, if you have a date command that accepts the "-u" argument.)  Note the
difference with using "!!date": that replaced a line, while ":read !date" will
insert a line.


WRITING TEXT TO A COMMAND

The Unix command "wc" counts words.  To count the words in the current file: >

	:write !wc

This is the same write command as before, but instead of a file name the "!"
character is used and the name of an external command.  The written text will
be passed to the specified command as its standard input.  The output could
look like this:

       4      47     249 ~

The "wc" command isn't verbose.  This means you have 4 lines, 47 words and 249
characters.

Watch out for this mistake: >

	:write! wc

This will write the file "wc" in the current directory, with force.  White
space is important here!


REDRAWING THE SCREEN

If the external command produced an error message, the display may have been
messed up.  Vim is very efficient and only redraws those parts of the screen
that it knows need redrawing.  But it can't know about what another program
has written.  To tell Vim to redraw the screen: >

	CTRL-L

==============================================================================

1. Getting started					*vms-started*

Vim (Vi IMproved) is a Vi-compatible text editor that runs on nearly every
operating system known to humanity.  Now use Vim on OpenVMS too, in character
or X/Motif environment.  It is fully featured and absolutely compatible with
Vim on other operating systems.

==============================================================================

2. Download files					*vms-download*

You can download the Vim source code by ftp from the official Vim site:
	ftp://ftp.vim.org/pub/vim/
Or use one of the mirrors:
	ftp://ftp.vim.org/pub/vim/MIRRORS

You can download precompiled executables from:
	http://www.polarhome.com/vim/
	ftp://ftp.polarhome.com/pub/vim/

To use the precompiled binary version, you need one of these archives:

  vim-XX-exe-ia64-gui.zip       IA64 GUI/Motif executables
  vim-XX-exe-ia64-gtk.zip       IA64 GUI/GTK executables
  vim-XX-exe-ia64-term.zip      IA64 console executables
  vim-XX-exe-axp-gui.zip	Alpha GUI/Motif executables
  vim-XX-exe-axp-gtk.zip	Alpha GUI/GTK executables
  vim-XX-exe-axp-term.zip       Alpha console executables
  vim-XX-exe-vax-gui.zip	VAX GUI executables
  vim-XX-exe-vax-term.zip       VAX console executables

and of course (optional)
  vim-XX-runtime.zip		runtime files

The binary archives contain: vim.exe, ctags.exe, xxd.exe files.

For GTK executables you will need GTKLIB that is available for
Alpha and IA64 platform.

==============================================================================

3. Compiling						*vms-compiling*

See the file [.SRC]INSTALLVMS.TXT.

==============================================================================

4. Problems						*vms-problems*

The code has been tested under Open VMS 6.2 - 8.2 on Alpha, VAX and IA64
platforms with the DEC C compiler.  It should work without big problems.
If your system does not have some include libraries you can tune up in
OS_VMS_CONF.H file.

If you decided to build Vim with +perl, +python, etc. options, first you need
to download OpenVMS distributions of Perl and Python.  Build and deploy the
libraries and change adequate lines in MAKE_VMS.MMS file.  There should not be
a problem from Vim side.

Also GTK, XPM library paths should be configured in MAKE_VMS.MMS

Note: Under VAX it should work with the DEC C compiler without problems.  The
VAX C compiler is not fully ANSI C compatible in pre-processor directives
semantics, therefore you have to use a converter program that will do the lion
part of the job.  For detailed instructions read file INSTALLvms.txt

MMS_VIM.EXE is build together with VIM.EXE, but for XXD.EXE you should
change to a subdirectory and build it separately.

CTAGS is not part of the Vim source distribution anymore, however the OpenVMS
specific source might contain CTAGS source files as described above.
You can find more information about CTAGS on VMS at
http://www.polarhome.com/ctags/

Advanced users may try some acrobatics in FEATURE.H file as well.

It is possible to compile with +xfontset +xim options too, but then you have
to set up GUI fonts etc. correctly.  See :help xim from Vim command prompt.

You may want to use GUI with GTK icons, then you have to download and install
GTK for OpenVMS or at least runtime shareable images - LIBGTK from
polarhome.com

For more advanced questions, please send your problem to Vim on VMS mailing
list <vim-vms@polarhome.com>
More about the vim-vms list can be found at:
http://www.polarhome.com/mailman/listinfo/vim-vms

==============================================================================

5. Deploy						*vms-deploy*

Vim uses a special directory structure to hold the document and runtime files:

   vim (or wherever)
    |- tmp
    |- vim57
    |----- doc
    |----- syntax
    |- vim62
    |----- doc
    |----- syntax
    |- vim64
    |----- doc
    |----- syntax
    vimrc    (system rc files)
    gvimrc

Use: >

	define/nolog VIM	device:[path.vim]
	define/nolog VIMRUNTIME device:[path.vim.vim60]
	define/nolog TMP	device:[path.tmp]

To get vim.exe to find its document, filetype, and syntax files, and to
specify a directory where temporary files will be located.  Copy the "runtime"
subdirectory of the Vim distribution to vimruntime.

Logicals $VIMRUNTIME and $TMP are optional.

If $VIMRUNTIME is not set, Vim will guess and try to set up automatically.
Read more about it at :help runtime

If $TMP is not set, you will not be able to use some functions as CTAGS,
XXD, printing etc. that use temporary directory for normal operation.
The $TMP directory should be readable and writable by the user(s).
The easiest way to set up $TMP is to define a logical: >

	define/nolog TMP SYS$SCRATCH
or as: >
	define/nolog TMP SYS$LOGIN

==============================================================================

6. Practical usage					*vms-usage*

Usually, you want to run just one version of Vim on your system, therefore
it is enough to dedicate one directory for Vim.
Copy the whole Vim runtime directory structure to the deployment position.
Add the following lines to your LOGIN.COM (in SYS$LOGIN directory).
Set up the logical $VIM as: >

	$ define VIM device:<path>

Set up some symbols: >

	$ ! vi starts Vim in chr. mode.
	$ vi*m  :== mcr VIM:VIM.EXE

	$ !gvi starts Vim in GUI mode.
	$ gv*im :== spawn/nowait mcr VIM:VIM.EXE -g

Please, check the notes for customization and configuration of symbols.

You may want to create .vimrc and .gvimrc files in your home directory
(SYS$LOGIN) to overwrite default settings.

The easiest way is just rename example files.  You may leave the menu file
(MENU.VIM) and files vimrc and gvimrc in the original $VIM directory.  It will
be the default setup for all users, and for users it is enough to just have
their own additions or resetting in their home directory in files .vimrc and
.gvimrc.  It should work without problems.

Note: Remember, system rc files (default for all users) don't have a leading
".".  So, system rc files are: >

	$VIM:vimrc
	$VIM:gvimrc
	$VIM:menu.vim

and user customized rc files are: >

	sys$login:.vimrc
	sys$login:.gvimrc

You can check that everything is at the right place with the :version command.

Example LOGIN.COM: >

	$ define/nolog VIM RF10:[UTIL.VIM]
	$ vi*m :== mcr VIM:VIM.EXE
	$ gv*im:== spawn/nowait/input=NLA0 mcr VIM:VIM.EXE -g -GEOMETRY 80x40
	$ set disp/create/node=192.168.5.223/trans=tcpip

Note: This set-up should be enough, if you are working on a standalone server or
clustered environment, but if you want to use Vim as an internode editor in
DECNET environment, it will satisfy as well.
You just have to define the "whole" path: >

	$ define VIM "<server_name>[""user password""]::device:<path>"
	$ vi*m :== "mcr VIM:VIM.EXE"

For example: >

	$ define VIM "PLUTO::RF10:[UTIL.VIM]"
	$ define VIM "PLUTO""ZAY mypass""::RF10:[UTIL.VIM]" ! if passwd required

You can also use the $VIMRUNTIME logical to point to the proper version of Vim
if you have installed more versions at the same time.  If $VIMRUNTIME is not
defined Vim will borrow its value from the $VIM logical.  You can find more
information about the $VIMRUNTIME logical by typing :help runtime as a Vim
command.

System administrators might want to set up a system wide Vim installation,
then add to the SYS$STARTUP:SYLOGICALS.COM >

	$ define/nolog/sys VIM device:<path>
	$ define/nolog/sys TMP SYS$SCRATCH

And to the SYS$STARTUP:SYLOGIN.COM >

	$ vi*m :== mcr VIM:VIM.EXE
	$ gv*im:== spawn/nowait/input=NLA0 mcr VIM:VIM.EXE -g -GEOMETRY 80x40


It will set up a normal Vim work environment for every user on the system.

IMPORTANT: Vim on OpenVMS (and on other case insensitive system) command line
parameters are assumed to be lowercase. In order to indicate that a command
line parameter is uppercase "/" sign must be used.

Examples:
  >
	vim -R  filename  ! means: -r List swap files and exit
	vim -/r filename  ! means: -R Readonly mode (like "view")
	vim -u	<vimrc>   ! means: -u Use <vimrc> instead of any .vimrc
	vim -/u <gvimrc>  ! means: -U Use <gvimrc> instead of any .gvimrc

7. GUI mode questions					*vms-gui*

OpenVMS is a real mainframe OS, therefore even if it has a GUI console, most
of the users do not use a native X/Window environment during normal operation.
It is not possible to start Vim in GUI mode "just like that".  But anyhow it
is not too complicated either.

First of all: you will need an executable that is built with the GUI enabled.

Second: you need to have installed DECW/Motif on your VMS server, otherwise
you will get errors that some shareable libraries are missing.

Third: If you choose to run Vim with extra features such as GUI/GTK then you
need a GTK installation too or at least a GTK runtime environment (LIBGTK
can be downloaded from http://www.polarhome.com/vim/).

1) If you are working on the VMS X/Motif console:
   Start Vim with the command: >

	$ mc device:<path>VIM.EXE -g
<
   or type :gui as a command to the Vim command prompt.  For more info :help
   gui

2) If you are working on some other X/Window environment like Unix or a remote
   X VMS console.  Set up display to your host with: >

	$ set disp/create/node=<your IP address>/trans=<transport-name>
<
   and start Vim as in point 1.  You can find more help in VMS documentation or
   type: help set disp in VMS prompt.
   Examples: >

	$ set disp/create/node=192.168.5.159		 ! default trans is DECnet
	$ set disp/create/node=192.168.5.159/trans=tcpip ! TCP/IP network
	$ set disp/create/node=192.168.5.159/trans=local ! display on the same node

Note: you should define just one of these.
For more information type $help set disp in VMS prompt.

3) Another elegant solution is XDM if you have installed on OpenVMS box.
   It is possible to work from XDM client as from GUI console.

4) If you are working on MS-Windows or some other non X/Window environment
   you need to set up one X server and run Vim as in point 2.
   For MS-Windows there are available free X servers as MIX, Omni X etc.,
   as well as excellent commercial products as eXcursion or ReflectionX with
   built-in DEC support.

Please note, that executables without GUI are slightly faster during startup
than with enabled GUI in character mode. Therefore, if you do not use GUI
features, it is worth to choose non GUI executables.

8.1 Backspace/delete

There are backspace/delete key inconsistencies with VMS.
:fixdel doesn't do the trick, but the solution is: >

	:inoremap ^? ^H		" for terminal mode
	:inoremap <Del> ^H	" for gui mode

Read more in ch: 8.6 (Terminal problems).
(Bruce Hunsaker <BNHunsaker@chq.byu.edu> Vim 5.3)


8.2 Filters

Vim supports filters, i.e., if you have a sort program that can handle
input/output redirection like Unix (<infile >outfile), you could use >

	:map \s 0!'aqsort<CR>

(Charles E. Campbell, Jr. <cec@gryphon.gsfc.nasa.gov> Vim 5.4)


8.3 VMS file version numbers

Vim is saving files into a new file with the next higher file version
number, try these settings. >

	:set nobackup	     " does not create *.*_ backup files
	:set nowritebackup   " does not have any purpose on VMS.  It's the
			     " default.

Recovery is working perfectly as well from the default swap file.
Read more with :help swapfile

(Claude Marinier <ClaudeMarinier@xwavesolutions.com> Vim 5.5, Zoltan Arpadffy
Vim 5.6)


8.4 Directory conversion

Vim will internally convert any unix-style paths and even mixed unix/VMS
paths into VMS style paths.  Some typical conversions resemble:

	/abc/def/ghi		-> abc:[def]ghi.
	/abc/def/ghi.j		-> abc:[def]ghi.j
	/abc/def/ghi.j;2	-> abc:[def]ghi.j;2
	/abc/def/ghi/jkl/mno	-> abc:[def.ghi.jkl]mno.
	abc:[def.ghi]jkl/mno	-> abc:[def.ghi.jkl]mno.
	  ./			-> current directory
	  ../			-> relative parent directory
	  [.def.ghi]		-> relative child directory
	   ./def/ghi		-> relative child directory

Note: You may use <,> brackets as well (device:<path>file.ext;version) as
rf10:<user.zay.work>test.c;1

(David Elins <delins@foliage.com>, Jerome Lauret
<JLAURET@mail.chem.sunysb.edu> Vim 5.6)


8.5 Remote host invocation

It is possible to use Vim as an internode editor.
1. Edit some file from remote node: >

	vi "<server>""username passwd""::<device>:<path><filename>;<version>"

Example: >
	vi "pluto""zay passwd""::RF10:<USER.ZAY.WORK>TEST.C;1"

Note: syntax is very important, otherwise VMS will recognize more parameters
instead of one (resulting with: file not found)

2.  Set up Vim as your internode editor.  If Vim is not installed on your
host, just set up your IP address, the full Vim path including the server name
and run the command procedure below: >

	$ if (p1 .eqs. "") .OR. (p2 .eqs. "") then goto usage
	$ set disp/create/node=<your_IP_here>/trans=tcpip
	$ define "VIM "<vim_server>""''p1' ''p2'""::<device>:<vim_path>"
	$  vi*m :== "mcr VIM:VIM.EXE"
	$ gv*im :== "spawn/nowait mcr VIM:VIM.EXE -g"
	$ goto end
	$ usage:
	$ write sys$output " Please enter username and password as a parameter."
	$ write sys$output " Example: @SETVIM.COM username passwd"
	$ end:

Note: Never use it in a clustered environment (you do not need it), loading
could be very-very slow, but even faster than a local Emacs. :-)

(Zoltan Arpadffy, Vim 5.6)


8.6 Terminal problems

If your terminal name is not known to Vim and it is trying to find the default
one you will get the following message during start-up:
---
Terminal entry not found in termcap
'unknown-terminal' not known.  Available built-in terminals are:
    builtin_gui
    builtin_riscos
    builtin_amiga
    builtin_beos-ansi
    builtin_ansi
    builtin_vt320
    builtin_vt52
    builtin_pcansi
    builtin_win32
    builtin_xterm
    builtin_iris-ansi
    builtin_debug
    builtin_dumb
defaulting to 'vt320'
---
The solution is to define the default terminal name: >

	$ ! unknown terminal name.  Let us use vt320 or ansi instead.
	$ ! Note: it's case sensitive
	$ define term "vt320"

Terminals from VT100 to VT320 (as V300, VT220, VT200) do not need any extra
keyboard mappings.  They should work perfectly as they are, including arrows,
Ins, Del buttons etc., except Backspace in GUI mode.  To solve it, add to
.gvimrc: >

	inoremap <Del> <BS>

Vim will also recognize that they are fast terminals.

If you have some annoying line jumping on the screen between windows add to
your .vimrc file: >

	set ttyfast	" set fast terminal

Note: if you're using Vim on remote host or through a very slow connection, it's
recommended to avoid the fast terminal option with: >

	set nottyfast   " set terminal to slow mode

(Zoltan Arpadffy, Vim 5.6)


8.7 Hex-editing and other external tools

A very important difference between OpenVMS and other systems is that VMS uses
special commands to execute executables: >

	RUN <path>filename
	MCR <path>filename <parameters>

OpenVMS users always have to be aware that the Vim command :! "just" drop them
to DCL prompt.  This feature is possible to use without any problem with all
DCL commands, but if we want to execute some programs such as XXD, CTAGS, JTAGS,
etc.  we're running into trouble if we follow the Vim documentation (see: help
xxd).

Solution: Execute with the MC command and add the full path to the executable.
Example: Instead of :%!xxd command use: >

	:%!mc vim:xxd

... or in general: >
	:!mc <path>filename <parameters>

Note: You can use XXD and CTAGS from GUI menu.

To customize ctags it is possible to define the logical $CTAGS with standard
parameters as: >

	define/nolog CTAGS "--totals -o sys$login:tags"

For additional information, please read :help tagsearch and CTAGS
documentation at http://ctags.sourceforge.net/ctags.html.

(Zoltan Arpadffy, Vim 5.6-70)


8.8 Sourcing vimrc and gvimrc

If you want to use your .vimrc and .gvimrc from other platforms (e.g. Windows)
you can get in trouble if you ftp that file(s): VMS has different end-of-line
indication.
The symptom is that Vim is not sourcing your .vimrc/.gvimrc, even if you say:
>
	:so sys$login:.vimrc

One trick is to compress (e.g. zip) the files on the other platform and
uncompress it on VMS; if you have the same symptom, try to create the files
with copy-paste (for this you need both op. systems reachable from one
machine, e.g. an Xterm on Windows or telnet to Windows from VMS).

(Sandor Kopanyi, <sandor.kopanyi@mailbox.hu> Vim 6.0a)


8.9 Printing from Vim

To be able to print from Vim (running in GUI mode) under VMS you have to set
up $TMP logical which should point to some temporary directory and logical
SYS$PRINT to your default print queue.
Example: >

	$define SYS$PRINT HP5ANSI

You can print out the whole buffer or just the marked area.
More info under :help hardcopy

(Zoltan Arpadffy, Vim 6.0c)


8.10 Setting up the symbols

When I use GVIM this way and press CTRL-Y in the parent terminal, gvim exits.
I now use a different symbol that seems to work OK and fixes the problem.
I suggest this instead: >

	$ GV*IM:==SPAWN/NOWAIT/INPUT=NLA0: MCR VIM:VIM.EXE -G -GEOMETRY 80X40

The /INPUT=NLA0: separates the standard input of the gvim process from the
parent terminal, to block signals from the parent window.
Without the -GEOMETRY, the GVIM window size will be minimal and the menu
will be confused after a window-resize.

(Carlo Mekenkamp, Coen Engelbarts, Vim 6.0ac)


8.11 diff and other GNU programs

From 6.0 diff functionality has been implemented, but OpenVMS does not use
GNU/Unix like diff therefore built in diff does not work.
There is a simple solution to solve this anomaly.  Install a Unix like diff
and Vim will work perfectly in diff mode too.  You just have to redefine your
diff program as: >

	define /nolog diff <GNU_PATH>diff.exe

Another, more sophisticated solution is described below (8.12 diff-mode)
There are other programs such as patch, make etc that may cause the same
problems.  At www.polarhome.com is possible to download an GNU package for
Alpha and VAX boxes that is meant to solve GNU problems on OpenVMS.
(Zoltan Arpadffy, Vim 6.1)


8.12 diff-mode

Vim 6.0 and higher supports Vim diff-mode (See |new-diff-mode|, |diff-mode|
and |08.7|).  This uses the external program 'diff' and expects a Unix-like
output format from diff.  The standard VMS diff has a different output
format.  To use Vim on VMS in diff-mode, you need to:
    1 Install a Unix-like diff program, e.g. GNU diff
    2 Tell Vim to use the Unix-like diff for diff-mode.

You can download GNU diff from the VIM-VMS website, it is one of the GNU
tools in http://www.polarhome.com/vim/files/gnu_tools.zip.  I suggest to
unpack it in a separate directory "GNU" and create a logical GNU: that
points to that directory, e.g: >

   DEFINE GNU    <DISK>:[<DIRECTORY>.BIN.GNU]

You may also want to define a symbol GDIFF, to use the GNU diff from the DCL
prompt: >

   GDIFF :==     $GNU:DIFF.EXE

Now you need to tell Vim to use the new diff program.  Take the example
settings from |diff-diffexpr| and change the call to the external diff
program to the new diff on VMS.  Add this to your .vimrc file: >

     " Set up vimdiff options
       if v:version >= 600
	" Use GNU diff on VMS
	set diffexpr=MyDiff()
	function MyDiff()
	   let opt = ""
	   if &diffopt =~ "icase"
	     let opt = opt . "-i "
	   endif
	   if &diffopt =~ "iwhite"
	     let opt = opt . "-b "
	   endif
	   silent execute "!mc GNU:diff.exe -a " . opt . v:fname_in . " " .  v:fname_new .
		\  " > " . v:fname_out
	endfunction
      endif

You can now use Vim in diff-mode, e.g. to compare two files in read-only
mode: >

    $ VIM -D/R <FILE1> <FILE2>

You can also define new symbols for vimdiff, e.g.: >

    $ VIMDIFF     :== 'VIM' -D/R
    $ GVIMDIFF    :== 'GVIM' -D/R

You can now compare files in 4 ways: >

    1. VMS  diff:  $ DIFF     <FILE1> <FILE2>
    2. GNU  diff:  $ GDIFF    <FILE1> <FILE2>
    3. VIM  diff:  $ VIMDIFF  <FILE1> <FILE2>
    4. GVIM diff:  $ GVIMDIFF <FILE1> <FILE2>

(Coen Engelbarts, Vim 6.1)


8.13 Allow '$' in C keywords

DEC C uses many identifiers with '$' in them.  This is not allowed in ANSI C,
and Vim recognises the '$' as the end of the identifier.  You can change this
with the 'iskeyword' option.
Add this command to your .vimrc file: >

    autocmd FileType c,cpp,cs  set iskeyword+=$

You can also create the file(s) $VIM/FTPLUGIN/C.VIM (and/or CPP.VIM and
CS.VIM) and add this command: >

	set iskeyword+=$

Now word-based commands, e.g. the '*'-search-command and the CTRL-]
tag-lookup, work on the whole identifier.  (Ctags on VMS also supports '$' in
C keywords since ctags version 5.1.)

(Coen Engelbarts, Vim 6.1)

8.14 VIMTUTOR for beginners

The VIMTUTOR.COM DCL script can help Vim beginners to learn/make their first
steps with Vim on OpenVMS.  Depending of binary distribution you may start it
with: >

	@vim:vimtutor

(Thomas.R.Wyant III, Vim 6.1)

8.16 Slow start in console mode issue

As GUI/GTK Vim works equally well in console mode, many administrators
deploy those executables system wide.
Unfortunately, on a remote slow connections GUI/GTK executables behave rather
slow when user wants to run Vim just in the console mode - because of X
environment detection timeout.

Luckily, there is a simple solution for that. Administrators need to deploy
both GUI/GTK build and just console build executables, like below: >

    |- vim73
    |----- doc
    |----- syntax
       vimrc    (system rc files)
       gvimrc
       gvim.exe (the renamed GUI or GTK built vim.exe)
       vim.exe  (the console only executable)

Define system symbols like below in for ex in LOGIN.COM or SYLOGIN.COM: >

	$ define/nolog VIM RF10:[UTIL.VIM73] ! where you VIM directory is
	$ vi*m  :== mcr VIM:VIM.EXE
	$ gvi*m :== mcr VIM:GVIM.EXE
	$ ! or you can try to spawn with
	$ gv*im :== spawn/nowait/input=NLA0 mcr VIM:GVIM.EXE -g -GEOMETRY 80x40


Like this, users that do not have X environment and want to use Vim just in
console mode can avoid performance problems.

(Zoltan Arpadffy, Vim 7.2)

8.15 Common VIM directory - different architectures

In a cluster that contains nodes with different architectures like below:

$show cluster
View of Cluster from system ID 11655  node: TOR                                                                     18-AUG-2008 11:58:31
+---------------------------------+
        SYSTEMS         MEMBERS 
+-----------------------+---------
  NODE     SOFTWARE     STATUS 
+--------+--------------+---------
 TOR     VMS V7.3-2    MEMBER  
 TITAN2  VMS V8.3      MEMBER  
 ODIN    VMS V7.3-2    MEMBER  
+---------------------------------+

It is convenient to have a common VIM directory but execute different
executables.
There are several solutions for this problem:

Solution 1.  All executables in the same directory with different names
This is easily done with the following script that can be added
to the login.com or sylogin.com: >

	$ if f$getsyi("NODE_HWTYPE") .eqs. "VAX"
	$ then
	$       say "VAX platform"
	$       vi*m:== mcr vim:VIM.EXE_VAX
	$ endif
	$ if f$getsyi("NODE_HWTYPE") .eqs. "ALPH"
	$ then
	$       say "ALPHA platform"
	$       vi*m :== mcr vim:VIM.EXE_AXP
	$ endif
	$ if f$getsyi("ARCH_NAME") .eqs. "IA64"
	$ then
	$      say "IA64 platform"
	$      vi*m :== mcr vim:VIM.EXE_IA64
	$ endif

Solution 2.  Different directories: >

	$ if f$getsyi("NODE_HWTYPE") .eqs. "VAX"
	$ then
	$       say "VAX platform"
	$       define/nolog VIM RF10:[UTIL.VAX_EXE] ! VAX executables
	$ endif
	$ if f$getsyi("NODE_HWTYPE") .eqs. "ALPH"
	$ then
	$       say "ALPHA platform"
	$       define/nolog VIM RF10:[UTIL.AXP_EXE] ! AXP executables
	$ endif
	$ if f$getsyi("ARCH_NAME") .eqs. "IA64"
	$ then
	$      say "IA64 platform"
	$      define/nolog VIM RF10:[UTIL.IA64_EXE] ! IA64 executables
	$ endif
        $! VIMRUNTIME must be defined in order to find runtime files
	$ define/nolog VIMRUNTIME RF10:[UTIL.VIM73]

A good example for this approach is the [GNU]gnu_tools.com script from
GNU_TOOLS.ZIP package downloadable from http://www.polarhome.com/vim/

Visual mode				*Visual* *Visual-mode* *visual-mode*

Visual mode is a flexible and easy way to select a piece of text for an
operator.  It is the only way to select a block of text.

This is introduced in section |04.4| of the user manual.

1. Using Visual mode			|visual-use|
2. Starting and stopping Visual mode	|visual-start|
3. Changing the Visual area		|visual-change|
4. Operating on the Visual area		|visual-operators|
5. Blockwise operators			|blockwise-operators|
6. Repeating				|visual-repeat|
7. Examples				|visual-examples|
8. Select mode				|Select-mode|

{Vi has no Visual mode, the name "visual" is used for Normal mode, to
distinguish it from Ex mode}
{Since Vim 7.4.200 the |+visual| feature is always included}

==============================================================================
1. Using Visual mode					*visual-use*

Using Visual mode consists of three parts:
1. Mark the start of the text with "v", "V" or CTRL-V.
   The character under the cursor will be used as the start.
2. Move to the end of the text.
   The text from the start of the Visual mode up to and including the
   character under the cursor is highlighted.
3. Type an operator command.
   The highlighted characters will be operated upon.

The 'highlight' option can be used to set the display mode to use for
highlighting in Visual mode.
The 'virtualedit' option can be used to allow positioning the cursor to
positions where there is no actual character.

The highlighted text normally includes the character under the cursor.
However, when the 'selection' option is set to "exclusive" and the cursor is
after the Visual area, the character under the cursor is not included.

With "v" the text before the start position and after the end position will
not be highlighted.  However, all uppercase and non-alpha operators, except
"~" and "U", will work on whole lines anyway.  See the list of operators
below.

							*visual-block*
With CTRL-V (blockwise Visual mode) the highlighted text will be a rectangle
between start position and the cursor.  However, some operators work on whole
lines anyway (see the list below).  The change and substitute operators will
delete the highlighted text and then start insertion at the top left
position.

==============================================================================
2. Starting and stopping Visual mode			*visual-start*

						*v* *characterwise-visual*
[count]v		Start Visual mode per character.
			With [count] select the same number of characters or
			lines as used for the last Visual operation, but at
			the current cursor position, multiplied by [count].
			When the previous Visual operation was on a block both
			the width and height of the block are multiplied by
			[count].
			When there was no previous Visual operation [count]
			characters are selected.  This is like moving the
			cursor right N * [count] characters.  One less when
			'selection' is not "exclusive".

						*V* *linewise-visual*
[count]V		Start Visual mode linewise.
			With [count] select the same number of lines as used
			for the last Visual operation, but at the current
			cursor position, multiplied by [count].  When there
			was no previous Visual operation [count] lines are
			selected.

						*CTRL-V* *blockwise-visual*
[count]CTRL-V		Start Visual mode blockwise.  Note: Under Windows
			CTRL-V could be mapped to paste text, it doesn't work
			to start Visual mode then, see |CTRL-V-alternative|.
			[count] is used as with `v` above.

If you use <Esc>, click the left mouse button or use any command that
does a jump to another buffer while in Visual mode, the highlighting stops
and no text is affected.  Also when you hit "v" in characterwise Visual mode,
"CTRL-V" in blockwise Visual mode or "V" in linewise Visual mode.  If you hit
CTRL-Z the highlighting stops and the editor is suspended or a new shell is
started |CTRL-Z|.

	      new mode after typing:		*v_v* *v_CTRL-V* *v_V*
old mode	     "v"	      "CTRL-V"		     "V"	~

Normal		    Visual	   blockwise Visual	  linewise Visual
Visual		    Normal	   blockwise Visual	  linewise Visual
blockwise Visual    Visual	   Normal		  linewise Visual
linewise Visual     Visual	   blockwise Visual	  Normal

						*gv* *v_gv* *reselect-Visual*
gv			Start Visual mode with the same area as the previous
			area and the same mode.
			In Visual mode the current and the previous Visual
			area are exchanged.
			After using "p" or "P" in Visual mode the text that
			was put will be selected.

								*gn* *v_gn*
gn			Search forward for the last used search pattern, like
			with `n`, and start Visual mode to select the match.
			If the cursor is on the match, visually selects it.
			If an operator is pending, operates on the match.
			E.g., "dgn" deletes the text of the next match.
			If Visual mode is active, extends the selection
			until the end of the next match.

								*gN* *v_gN*
gN			Like |gn| but searches backward, like with `N`.

							*<LeftMouse>*
<LeftMouse>		Set the current cursor position.  If Visual mode is
			active it is stopped.  Only when 'mouse' option is
			contains 'n' or 'a'.  If the position is within 'so'
			lines from the last line on the screen the text is
			scrolled up.  If the position is within 'so' lines from
			the first line on the screen the text is scrolled
			down.

							*<RightMouse>*
<RightMouse>		Start Visual mode if it is not active.  The text from
			the cursor position to the position of the click is
			highlighted.  If Visual mode was already active move
			the start or end of the highlighted text, which ever
			is closest, to the position of the click.  Only when
			'mouse' option contains 'n' or 'a'.

			Note: when 'mousemodel' is set to "popup",
			<S-LeftMouse> has to be used instead of <RightMouse>.

							*<LeftRelease>*
<LeftRelease>		This works like a <LeftMouse>, if it is not at
			the same position as <LeftMouse>.  In an older version
			of xterm you won't see the selected area until the
			button is released, unless there is access to the
			display where the xterm is running (via the DISPLAY
			environment variable or the -display argument).  Only
			when 'mouse' option contains 'n' or 'a'.

If Visual mode is not active and the "v", "V" or CTRL-V is preceded with a
count, the size of the previously highlighted area is used for a start.  You
can then move the end of the highlighted area and give an operator.  The type
of the old area is used (character, line or blockwise).
- Linewise Visual mode: The number of lines is multiplied with the count.
- Blockwise Visual mode: The number of lines and columns is multiplied with
  the count.
- Normal Visual mode within one line: The number of characters is multiplied
  with the count.
- Normal Visual mode with several lines: The number of lines is multiplied
  with the count, in the last line the same number of characters is used as
  in the last line in the previously highlighted area.
The start of the text is the Cursor position.  If the "$" command was used as
one of the last commands to extend the highlighted text, the area will be
extended to the rightmost column of the longest line.

If you want to highlight exactly the same area as the last time, you can use
"gv" |gv| |v_gv|.

							*v_<Esc>*
<Esc>			In Visual mode: Stop Visual mode.

							*v_CTRL-C*
CTRL-C			In Visual mode: Stop Visual mode.  When insert mode is
			pending (the mode message shows
			"-- (insert) VISUAL --"), it is also stopped.

==============================================================================
3. Changing the Visual area				*visual-change*

							*v_o*
o			Go to Other end of highlighted text: The current
			cursor position becomes the start of the highlighted
			text and the cursor is moved to the other end of the
			highlighted text.  The highlighted area remains the
			same.

							*v_O*
O			Go to Other end of highlighted text.  This is like
			"o", but in Visual block mode the cursor moves to the
			other corner in the same line.  When the corner is at
			a character that occupies more than one position on
			the screen (e.g., a <Tab>), the highlighted text may
			change.

							*v_$*
When the "$" command is used with blockwise Visual mode, the right end of the
highlighted text will be determined by the longest highlighted line.  This
stops when a motion command is used that does not move straight up or down.

For moving the end of the block many commands can be used, but you cannot
use Ex commands, commands that make changes or abandon the file.  Commands
(starting with) ".", "&", CTRL-^, "Z", CTRL-], CTRL-T, CTRL-R, CTRL-I
and CTRL-O cause a beep and Visual mode continues.

When switching to another window on the same buffer, the cursor position in
that window is adjusted, so that the same Visual area is still selected.  This
is especially useful to view the start of the Visual area in one window, and
the end in another.  You can then use <RightMouse> (or <S-LeftMouse> when
'mousemodel' is "popup") to drag either end of the Visual area.

==============================================================================
4. Operating on the Visual area				*visual-operators*

The operators that can be used are:
	~	switch case					|v_~|
	d	delete						|v_d|
	c	change (4)					|v_c|
	y	yank						|v_y|
	>	shift right (4)					|v_>|
	<	shift left (4)					|v_<|
	!	filter through external command (1)		|v_!|
	=	filter through 'equalprg' option command (1)	|v_=|
	gq	format lines to 'textwidth' length (1)		|v_gq|

The objects that can be used are:
	aw	a word (with white space)			|v_aw|
	iw	inner word					|v_iw|
	aW	a WORD (with white space)			|v_aW|
	iW	inner WORD					|v_iW|
	as	a sentence (with white space)			|v_as|
	is	inner sentence					|v_is|
	ap	a paragraph (with white space)			|v_ap|
	ip	inner paragraph					|v_ip|
	ab	a () block (with parenthesis)			|v_ab|
	ib	inner () block					|v_ib|
	aB	a {} block (with braces)			|v_aB|
	iB	inner {} block					|v_iB|
	at	a <tag> </tag> block (with tags)		|v_at|
	it	inner <tag> </tag> block			|v_it|
	a<	a <> block (with <>)				|v_a<|
	i<	inner <> block					|v_i<|
	a[	a [] block (with [])				|v_a[|
	i[	inner [] block					|v_i[|
	a"	a double quoted string (with quotes)		|v_aquote|
	i"	inner double quoted string			|v_iquote|
	a'	a single quoted string (with quotes)		|v_a'|
	i'	inner simple quoted string			|v_i'|
	a`	a string in backticks (with backticks)		|v_a`|
	i`	inner string in backticks			|v_i`|

Additionally the following commands can be used:
	:	start Ex command for highlighted lines (1)	|v_:|
	r	change (4)					|v_r|
	s	change						|v_s|
	C	change (2)(4)					|v_C|
	S	change (2)					|v_S|
	R	change (2)					|v_R|
	x	delete						|v_x|
	D	delete (3)					|v_D|
	X	delete (2)					|v_X|
	Y	yank (2)					|v_Y|
	p	put						|v_p|
	J	join (1)					|v_J|
	U	make uppercase					|v_U|
	u	make lowercase					|v_u|
	^]	find tag					|v_CTRL-]|
	I	block insert					|v_b_I|
	A	block append					|v_b_A|

(1): Always whole lines, see |:visual_example|.
(2): Whole lines when not using CTRL-V.
(3): Whole lines when not using CTRL-V, delete until the end of the line when
     using CTRL-V.
(4): When using CTRL-V operates on the block only.

Note that the ":vmap" command can be used to specifically map keys in Visual
mode.  For example, if you would like the "/" command not to extend the Visual
area, but instead take the highlighted text and search for that: >
	:vmap / y/<C-R>"<CR>
(In the <> notation |<>|, when typing it you should type it literally; you
need to remove the 'B' and '<' flags from 'cpoptions'.)

If you want to give a register name using the """ command, do this just before
typing the operator character: "v{move-around}"xd".

If you want to give a count to the command, do this just before typing the
operator character: "v{move-around}3>" (move lines 3 indents to the right).

							*{move-around}*
The {move-around} is any sequence of movement commands.  Note the difference
with {motion}, which is only ONE movement command.

Another way to operate on the Visual area is using the |/\%V| item in a
pattern.  For example, to replace all '(' in the Visual area with '#': >

	:'<,'>s/\%V(/#/g

Note that the "'<,'>" will appear automatically when you press ":" in Visual
mode.

==============================================================================
5. Blockwise operators					*blockwise-operators*

{not available when compiled without the |+visualextra| feature}

Reminder: Use 'virtualedit' to be able to select blocks that start or end
after the end of a line or halfway a tab.

Visual-block Insert						*v_b_I*
With a blockwise selection, I{string}<ESC> will insert {string} at the start
of block on every line of the block, provided that the line extends into the
block.  Thus lines that are short will remain unmodified.  TABs are split to
retain visual columns.
See |v_b_I_example|.

Visual-block Append						*v_b_A*
With a blockwise selection, A{string}<ESC> will append {string} to the end of
block on every line of the block.  There is some differing behavior where the
block RHS is not straight, due to different line lengths:

1. Block was created with <C-v>$
    In this case the string is appended to the end of each line.
2. Block was created with <C-v>{move-around}
    In this case the string is appended to the end of the block on each line,
    and whitespace is inserted to pad to the end-of-block column.
See |v_b_A_example|.
Note: "I" and "A" behave differently for lines that don't extend into the
selected block.  This was done intentionally, so that you can do it the way
you want.

Visual-block change						*v_b_c*
All selected text in the block will be replaced by the same text string.  When
using "c" the selected text is deleted and Insert mode started.  You can then
enter text (without a line break).  When you hit <Esc>, the same string is
inserted in all previously selected lines.

Visual-block Change						*v_b_C*
Like using "c", but the selection is extended until the end of the line for
all lines.

								*v_b_<*
Visual-block Shift						*v_b_>*
The block is shifted by 'shiftwidth'.  The RHS of the block is irrelevant.  The
LHS of the block determines the point from which to apply a right shift, and
padding includes TABs optimally according to 'ts' and 'et'.  The LHS of the
block determines the point upto which to shift left.
See |v_b_>_example|.
See |v_b_<_example|.

Visual-block Replace						*v_b_r*
Every screen char in the highlighted region is replaced with the same char, ie
TABs are split and the virtual whitespace is replaced, maintaining screen
layout.
See |v_b_r_example|.


==============================================================================
6. Repeating						*visual-repeat*

When repeating a Visual mode operator, the operator will be applied to the
same amount of text as the last time:
- Linewise Visual mode: The same number of lines.
- Blockwise Visual mode: The same number of lines and columns.
- Normal Visual mode within one line: The same number of characters.
- Normal Visual mode with several lines: The same number of lines, in the
  last line the same number of characters as in the last line the last time.
The start of the text is the Cursor position.  If the "$" command was used as
one of the last commands to extend the highlighted text, the repeating will
be applied up to the rightmost column of the longest line.


==============================================================================
7. Examples						*visual-examples*

							*:visual_example*
Currently the ":" command works on whole lines only.  When you select part of
a line, doing something like ":!date" will replace the whole line.  If you
want only part of the line to be replaced you will have to make a mapping for
it.  In a future release ":" may work on partial lines.

Here is an example, to replace the selected text with the output of "date": >
	:vmap _a <Esc>`>a<CR><Esc>`<i<CR><Esc>!!date<CR>kJJ

(In the <> notation |<>|, when typing it you should type it literally; you
need to remove the 'B' and '<' flags from 'cpoptions')

What this does is:
<Esc>		stop Visual mode
`>		go to the end of the Visual area
a<CR><Esc>	break the line after the Visual area
`<		jump to the start of the Visual area
i<CR><Esc>	break the line before the Visual area
!!date<CR>	filter the Visual text through date
kJJ		Join the lines back together

							*visual-search*
Here is an idea for a mapping that makes it possible to do a search for the
selected text: >
	:vmap X y/<C-R>"<CR>

(In the <> notation |<>|, when typing it you should type it literally; you
need to remove the 'B' and '<' flags from 'cpoptions')

Note that special characters (like '.' and '*') will cause problems.

Visual-block Examples					*blockwise-examples*
With the following text, I will indicate the commands to produce the block and
the results below.  In all cases, the cursor begins on the 'a' in the first
line of the test text.
The following modeline settings are assumed ":ts=8:sw=4:".

It will be helpful to
:set hls
/<TAB>
where <TAB> is a real TAB.  This helps visualise the operations.

The test text is:

abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz
abc		defghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz
abcdef  ghi		jklmnopqrstuvwxyz
abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz

1. fo<C-v>3jISTRING<ESC>					*v_b_I_example*

abcdefghijklmnSTRINGopqrstuvwxyz
abc	      STRING  defghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz
abcdef  ghi   STRING	jklmnopqrstuvwxyz
abcdefghijklmnSTRINGopqrstuvwxyz

2. fo<C-v>3j$ASTRING<ESC>					*v_b_A_example*

abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzSTRING
abc		defghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzSTRING
abcdef  ghi		jklmnopqrstuvwxyzSTRING
abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzSTRING

3. fo<C-v>3j3l<..						*v_b_<_example*

abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz
abc	      defghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz
abcdef  ghi   jklmnopqrstuvwxyz
abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz

4. fo<C-v>3j>..							*v_b_>_example*

abcdefghijklmn		  opqrstuvwxyz
abc			    defghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz
abcdef  ghi			    jklmnopqrstuvwxyz
abcdefghijklmn		  opqrstuvwxyz

5. fo<C-v>5l3jrX						*v_b_r_example*

abcdefghijklmnXXXXXXuvwxyz
abc	      XXXXXXhijklmnopqrstuvwxyz
abcdef  ghi   XXXXXX    jklmnopqrstuvwxyz
abcdefghijklmnXXXXXXuvwxyz

==============================================================================
8. Select mode						*Select* *Select-mode*

Select mode looks like Visual mode, but the commands accepted are quite
different.  This resembles the selection mode in Microsoft Windows.
When the 'showmode' option is set, "-- SELECT --" is shown in the last line.

Entering Select mode:
- Using the mouse to select an area, and 'selectmode' contains "mouse".
  'mouse' must also contain a flag for the current mode.
- Using a non-printable movement command, with the Shift key pressed, and
  'selectmode' contains "key".  For example: <S-Left> and <S-End>.  'keymodel'
  must also contain "startsel".
- Using "v", "V" or CTRL-V command, and 'selectmode' contains "cmd".
- Using "gh", "gH" or "g_CTRL-H" command in Normal mode.
- From Visual mode, press CTRL-G.			*v_CTRL-G*

Commands in Select mode:
- Printable characters, <NL> and <CR> cause the selection to be deleted, and
  Vim enters Insert mode.  The typed character is inserted.
- Non-printable movement commands, with the Shift key pressed, extend the
  selection.  'keymodel' must include "startsel".
- Non-printable movement commands, with the Shift key NOT pressed, stop Select
  mode.  'keymodel' must include "stopsel".
- ESC stops Select mode.
- CTRL-O switches to Visual mode for the duration of one command. *v_CTRL-O*
- CTRL-G switches to Visual mode.

Otherwise, typed characters are handled as in Visual mode.

When using an operator in Select mode, and the selection is linewise, the
selected lines are operated upon, but like in characterwise selection.  For
example, when a whole line is deleted, it can later be pasted halfway a line.


Mappings and menus in Select mode.			*Select-mode-mapping*

When mappings and menus are defined with the |:vmap| or |:vmenu| command they
work both in Visual mode and in Select mode.  When these are used in Select
mode Vim automatically switches to Visual mode, so that the same behavior as
in Visual mode is effective.  If you don't want this use |:xmap| or |:smap|.

Users will expect printable characters to replace the selected area.
Therefore avoid mapping printable characters in Select mode.  Or use
|:sunmap|  after |:map| and |:vmap| to remove it for Select mode.

After the mapping or menu finishes, the selection is enabled again and Select
mode entered, unless the selected area was deleted, another buffer became
the current one or the window layout was changed.

When a character was typed that causes the selection to be deleted and Insert
mode started, Insert mode mappings are applied to this character.  This may
cause some confusion, because it means Insert mode mappings apply to a
character typed in Select mode.  Language mappings apply as well.

							*gV* *v_gV*
gV			Avoid the automatic reselection of the Visual area
			after a Select mode mapping or menu has finished.
			Put this just before the end of the mapping or menu.
			At least it should be after any operations on the
			selection.

							*gh*
gh			Start Select mode, characterwise.  This is like "v",
			but starts Select mode instead of Visual mode.
			Mnemonic: "get highlighted".

							*gH*
gH			Start Select mode, linewise.  This is like "V",
			but starts Select mode instead of Visual mode.
			Mnemonic: "get Highlighted".

							*g_CTRL-H*
g CTRL-H		Start Select mode, blockwise.  This is like CTRL-V,
			but starts Select mode instead of Visual mode.

Last change: 2012 Feb 11


		  VIM REFERENCE MANUAL    by Bram Moolenaar


Debugging Vim						*debug-vim*

This is for debugging Vim itself, when it doesn't work properly.
For debugging Vim scripts, functions, etc. see |debug-scripts|

1. Location of a crash, using gcc and gdb	|debug-gcc|
2. Locating memory leaks			|debug-leaks|
3. Windows Bug Reporting			|debug-win32|

==============================================================================

1. Location of a crash, using gcc and gdb		*debug-gcc* *gdb*

When Vim crashes in one of the test files, and you are using gcc for
compilation, here is what you can do to find out exactly where Vim crashes.
This also applies when using the MingW tools.

1. Compile Vim with the "-g" option (there is a line in the src/Makefile for
   this, which you can uncomment).  Also make sure "strip" is disabled (do not
   install it, or use the line "STRIP = /bin/true").

2. Execute these commands (replace "11" with the test that fails): >
	cd testdir
	gdb ../vim
	run -u unix.vim -U NONE -s dotest.in test11.in

3. Check where Vim crashes, gdb should give a message for this.

4. Get a stack trace from gdb with this command: >
	where
<  You can check out different places in the stack trace with: >
	frame 3
<  Replace "3" with one of the numbers in the stack trace.

==============================================================================

2. Locating memory leaks			*debug-leaks* *valgrind*

If you suspect Vim is leaking memory and you are using Linux, the valgrind
tool is very useful to pinpoint memory leaks.

First of all, build Vim with EXITFREE defined.  Search for this in MAKEFILE
and uncomment the line.

Use this command to start Vim:
>
	valgrind --log-file=valgrind.log --leak-check=full ./vim

Note: Vim will run much slower.  If your .vimrc is big or you have several
plugins you need to be patient for startup, or run with the "-u NONE"
argument.

There are often a few leaks from libraries, such as getpwuid() and
XtVaAppCreateShell().  Those are unavoidable.  The number of bytes should be
very small a Kbyte or less.

==============================================================================

3. Windows Bug Reporting				*debug-win32*

If the Windows version of Vim crashes in a reproducible manner, you can take
some steps to provide a useful bug report.


3.1 GENERIC ~

You must obtain the debugger symbols (PDB) file for your executable: gvim.pdb
for gvim.exe, or vim.pdb for vim.exe. The PDB should be available from the
same place that you obtained the executable. Be sure to use the PDB that
matches the EXE (same date).

If you built the executable yourself with the Microsoft Visual C++ compiler,
then the PDB was built with the EXE.

Alternatively, if you have the source files, you can import Make_ivc.mak into
Visual Studio as a workspace.  Then select a debug configuration, build and
you can do all kinds of debugging (set breakpoints, watch variables, etc.).

If you have Visual Studio, use that instead of the VC Toolkit and WinDbg.

For other compilers, you should always use the corresponding debugger: TD for
a Vim executable compiled with the Borland compiler; gdb (see above
|debug-gcc|) for the Cygwin and MinGW compilers.


								*debug-vs2005*
3.2 Debugging Vim crashes with Visual Studio 2005/Visual C++ 2005 Express ~

First launch vim.exe or gvim.exe and then launch Visual Studio.  (If you don't
have Visual Studio, follow the instructions at |get-ms-debuggers| to obtain a
free copy of Visual C++ 2005 Express Edition.)

On the Tools menu, click Attach to Process.  Choose the Vim process.

In Vim, reproduce the crash.  A dialog will appear in Visual Studio, telling
you about the unhandled exception in the Vim process.  Click Break to break
into the process.

Visual Studio will pop up another dialog, telling you that no symbols are
loaded and that the source code cannot be displayed.  Click OK.

Several windows will open.  Right-click in the Call Stack window.  Choose Load
Symbols.  The Find Symbols dialog will open, looking for (g)vim.pdb.  Navigate
to the directory where you have the PDB file and click Open.

At this point, you should have a full call stack with vim function names and
line numbers.  Double-click one of the lines and the Find Source dialog will
appear.  Navigate to the directory where the Vim source is (if you have it.)

If you don't know how to debug this any further, follow the instructions
at ":help bug-reports".  Paste the call stack into the bug report.

If you have a non-free version of Visual Studio, you can save a minidump via
the Debug menu and send it with the bug report.  A minidump is a small file
(<100KB), which contains information about the state of your process.
Visual C++ 2005 Express Edition cannot save minidumps and it cannot be
installed as a just-in-time debugger. Use WinDbg, |debug-windbg|, if you
need to save minidumps or you want a just-in-time (postmortem) debugger.

								*debug-windbg*
3.3 Debugging Vim crashes with WinDbg ~

See |get-ms-debuggers| to obtain a copy of WinDbg.

As with the Visual Studio IDE, you can attach WinDbg to a running Vim process.
You can also have your system automatically invoke WinDbg as a postmortem
debugger. To set WinDbg as your postmortem debugger, run "windbg -I".

To attach WinDbg to a running Vim process, launch WinDbg. On the File menu,
choose Attach to a Process. Select the Vim process and click OK.

At this point, choose Symbol File Path on the File menu, and add the folder
containing your Vim PDB to the sympath. If you have Vim source available,
use Source File Path on the File menu. You can now open source files in WinDbg
and set breakpoints, if you like. Reproduce your crash. WinDbg should open the
source file at the point of the crash. Using the View menu, you can examine
the call stack, local variables, watch windows, and so on.

If WinDbg is your postmortem debugger, you do not need to attach WinDbg to
your Vim process. Simply reproduce the crash and WinDbg will launch
automatically. As above, set the Symbol File Path and the Source File Path.

To save a minidump, type the following at the WinDbg command line: >
        .dump vim.dmp
<
							*debug-minidump*
3.4 Opening a Minidump ~

If you have a minidump file, you can open it in Visual Studio or in WinDbg.

In Visual Studio 2005: on the File menu, choose Open, then Project/Solution.
Navigate to the .dmp file and open it. Now press F5 to invoke the debugger.
Follow the instructions in |debug-vs2005| to set the Symbol File Path.

In WinDbg: choose Open Crash Dump on the File menu. Follow the instructions in
|debug-windbg| to set the Symbol File Path.

							*get-ms-debuggers*
3.5 Obtaining Microsoft Debugging Tools ~

The Debugging Tools for Windows (including WinDbg) can be downloaded from
    http://www.microsoft.com/whdc/devtools/debugging/default.mspx
This includes the WinDbg debugger.

Visual C++ 2005 Express Edition can be downloaded for free from:
    http://msdn.microsoft.com/vstudio/express/visualC/default.aspx

		     VIM USER MANUAL - by Bram Moolenaar

			     Select your language


The messages in Vim can be given in several languages.  This chapter explains
how to change which one is used.  Also, the different ways to work with files
in various languages is explained.

|45.1|	Language for Messages
|45.2|	Language for Menus
|45.3|	Using another encoding
|45.4|	Editing files with a different encoding
|45.5|	Entering language text

     Next chapter: |usr_90.txt|  Installing Vim
 Previous chapter: |usr_44.txt|  Your own syntax highlighted
Table of contents: |usr_toc.txt|

==============================================================================
*45.1*	Language for Messages

When you start Vim, it checks the environment to find out what language you
are using.  Mostly this should work fine, and you get the messages in your
language (if they are available).  To see what the current language is, use
this command: >

	:language

If it replies with "C", this means the default is being used, which is
English.

	Note:
	Using different languages only works when Vim was compiled to handle
	it.  To find out if it works, use the ":version" command and check the
	output for "+gettext" and "+multi_lang".  If they are there, you are
	OK.  If you see "-gettext" or "-multi_lang" you will have to find
	another Vim.

What if you would like your messages in a different language?  There are
several ways.  Which one you should use depends on the capabilities of your
system.
   The first way is to set the environment to the desired language before
starting Vim.  Example for Unix: >

	env LANG=de_DE.ISO_8859-1  vim

This only works if the language is available on your system.  The advantage is
that all the GUI messages and things in libraries will use the right language
as well.  A disadvantage is that you must do this before starting Vim.  If you
want to change language while Vim is running, you can use the second method: >

	:language fr_FR.ISO_8859-1

This way you can try out several names for your language.  You will get an
error message when it's not supported on your system.  You don't get an error
when translated messages are not available.  Vim will silently fall back to
using English.
   To find out which languages are supported on your system, find the
directory where they are listed.  On my system it is "/usr/share/locale".  On
some systems it's in "/usr/lib/locale".  The manual page for "setlocale"
should give you a hint where it is found on your system.
   Be careful to type the name exactly as it should be.  Upper and lowercase
matter, and the '-' and '_' characters are easily confused.

You can also set the language separately for messages, edited text and the
time format.  See |:language|.


DO-IT-YOURSELF MESSAGE TRANSLATION

If translated messages are not available for your language, you could write
them yourself.  To do this, get the source code for Vim and the GNU gettext
package.  After unpacking the sources, instructions can be found in the
directory src/po/README.txt.
   It's not too difficult to do the translation.  You don't need to be a
programmer.  You must know both English and the language you are translating
to, of course.
   When you are satisfied with the translation, consider making it available
to others.  Upload it at vim-online (http://vim.sf.net) or e-mail it to
the Vim maintainer <maintainer@vim.org>.  Or both.

==============================================================================
*45.2*	Language for Menus

The default menus are in English.  To be able to use your local language, they
must be translated.  Normally this is automatically done for you if the
environment is set for your language, just like with messages.  You don't need
to do anything extra for this.  But it only works if translations for the
language are available.
   Suppose you are in Germany, with the language set to German, but prefer to
use "File" instead of "Datei".  You can switch back to using the English menus
this way: >

	:set langmenu=none

It is also possible to specify a language: >

	:set langmenu=nl_NL.ISO_8859-1

Like above, differences between "-" and "_" matter.  However, upper/lowercase
differences are ignored here.
   The 'langmenu' option must be set before the menus are loaded.  Once the
menus have been defined changing 'langmenu' has no direct effect.  Therefore,
put the command to set 'langmenu' in your vimrc file.
   If you really want to switch menu language while running Vim, you can do it
this way: >

	:source $VIMRUNTIME/delmenu.vim
	:set langmenu=de_DE.ISO_8859-1
	:source $VIMRUNTIME/menu.vim

There is one drawback: All menus that you defined yourself will be gone.  You
will need to redefine them as well.


DO-IT-YOURSELF MENU TRANSLATION

To see which menu translations are available, look in this directory:

	$VIMRUNTIME/lang ~

The files are called menu_{language}.vim.  If you don't see the language you
want to use, you can do your own translations.  The simplest way to do this is
by copying one of the existing language files, and change it.
   First find out the name of your language with the ":language" command.  Use
this name, but with all letters made lowercase.  Then copy the file to your
own runtime directory, as found early in 'runtimepath'.  For example, for Unix
you would do: >

	:!cp $VIMRUNTIME/lang/menu_ko_kr.euckr.vim ~/.vim/lang/menu_nl_be.iso_8859-1.vim

You will find hints for the translation in "$VIMRUNTIME/lang/README.txt".

==============================================================================
*45.3*	Using another encoding

Vim guesses that the files you are going to edit are encoded for your
language.  For many European languages this is "latin1".  Then each byte is
one character.  That means there are 256 different characters possible.  For
Asian languages this is not sufficient.  These mostly use a double-byte
encoding, providing for over ten thousand possible characters.  This still
isn't enough when a text is to contain several different languages.  This is
where Unicode comes in.  It was designed to include all characters used in
commonly used languages.  This is the "Super encoding that replaces all
others".  But it isn't used that much yet.
   Fortunately, Vim supports these three kinds of encodings.  And, with some
restrictions, you can use them even when your environment uses another
language than the text.
   Nevertheless, when you only edit files that are in the encoding of your
language, the default should work fine and you don't need to do anything.  The
following is only relevant when you want to edit different languages.

	Note:
	Using different encodings only works when Vim was compiled to handle
	it.  To find out if it works, use the ":version" command and check the
	output for "+multi_byte".  If it's there, you are OK.  If you see
	"-multi_byte" you will have to find another Vim.


USING UNICODE IN THE GUI

The nice thing about Unicode is that other encodings can be converted to it
and back without losing information.  When you make Vim use Unicode
internally, you will be able to edit files in any encoding.
   Unfortunately, the number of systems supporting Unicode is still limited.
Thus it's unlikely that your language uses it.  You need to tell Vim you want
to use Unicode, and how to handle interfacing with the rest of the system.
   Let's start with the GUI version of Vim, which is able to display Unicode
characters.  This should work: >

	:set encoding=utf-8
	:set guifont=-misc-fixed-medium-r-normal--18-120-100-100-c-90-iso10646-1

The 'encoding' option tells Vim the encoding of the characters that you use.
This applies to the text in buffers (files you are editing), registers, Vim
script files, etc.  You can regard 'encoding' as the setting for the internals
of Vim.
   This example assumes you have this font on your system.  The name in the
example is for the X Window System.  This font is in a package that is used to
enhance xterm with Unicode support.  If you don't have this font, you might
find it here:

	http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~mgk25/download/ucs-fonts.tar.gz ~

For MS-Windows, some fonts have a limited number of Unicode characters.  Try
using the "Courier New" font.  You can use the Edit/Select Font... menu to
select and try out the fonts available.  Only fixed-width fonts can be used
though.  Example: >

	:set guifont=courier_new:h12

If it doesn't work well, try getting a fontpack.  If Microsoft didn't move it,
you can find it here:

	http://www.microsoft.com/typography/fonts/default.aspx ~

Now you have told Vim to use Unicode internally and display text with a
Unicode font.  Typed characters still arrive in the encoding of your original
language.  This requires converting them to Unicode.  Tell Vim the language
from which to convert with the 'termencoding' option.  You can do it like
this: >

	:let &termencoding = &encoding
	:set encoding=utf-8

This assigns the old value of 'encoding' to 'termencoding' before setting
'encoding' to utf-8.  You will have to try out if this really works for your
setup.  It should work especially well when using an input method for an Asian
language, and you want to edit Unicode text.


USING UNICODE IN A UNICODE TERMINAL

There are terminals that support Unicode directly.  The standard xterm that
comes with XFree86 is one of them.  Let's use that as an example.
   First of all, the xterm must have been compiled with Unicode support.  See
|UTF8-xterm| how to check that and how to compile it when needed.
   Start the xterm with the "-u8" argument.  You might also need so specify a
font.  Example: >

   xterm -u8 -fn -misc-fixed-medium-r-normal--18-120-100-100-c-90-iso10646-1

Now you can run Vim inside this terminal.  Set 'encoding' to "utf-8" as
before.  That's all.


USING UNICODE IN AN ORDINARY TERMINAL

Suppose you want to work with Unicode files, but don't have a terminal with
Unicode support.  You can do this with Vim, although characters that are not
supported by the terminal will not be displayed.  The layout of the text
will be preserved.  >

	:let &termencoding = &encoding
	:set encoding=utf-8

This is the same as what was used for the GUI.  But it works differently: Vim
will convert the displayed text before sending it to the terminal.  That
avoids that the display is messed up with strange characters.
   For this to work the conversion between 'termencoding' and 'encoding' must
be possible.  Vim will convert from latin1 to Unicode, thus that always works.
For other conversions the |+iconv| feature is required.
   Try editing a file with Unicode characters in it.  You will notice that Vim
will put a question mark (or underscore or some other character) in places
where a character should be that the terminal can't display.  Move the cursor
to a question mark and use this command: >

	ga

Vim will display a line with the code of the character.  This gives you a hint
about what character it is.  You can look it up in a Unicode table.  You could
actually view a file that way, if you have lots of time at hand.

	Note:
	Since 'encoding' is used for all text inside Vim, changing it makes
	all non-ASCII text invalid.  You will notice this when using registers
	and the 'viminfo' file (e.g., a remembered search pattern).  It's
	recommended to set 'encoding' in your vimrc file, and leave it alone.

==============================================================================
*45.4*	Editing files with a different encoding

Suppose you have setup Vim to use Unicode, and you want to edit a file that is
in 16-bit Unicode.  Sounds simple, right?  Well, Vim actually uses utf-8
encoding internally, thus the 16-bit encoding must be converted, since there
is a difference between the character set (Unicode) and the encoding (utf-8 or
16-bit).
   Vim will try to detect what kind of file you are editing.  It uses the
encoding names in the 'fileencodings' option.  When using Unicode, the default
value is: "ucs-bom,utf-8,latin1".  This means that Vim checks the file to see
if it's one of these encodings:

	ucs-bom		File must start with a Byte Order Mark (BOM).  This
			allows detection of 16-bit, 32-bit and utf-8 Unicode
			encodings.
	utf-8		utf-8 Unicode.  This is rejected when a sequence of
			bytes is illegal in utf-8.
	latin1		The good old 8-bit encoding.  Always works.

When you start editing that 16-bit Unicode file, and it has a BOM, Vim will
detect this and convert the file to utf-8 when reading it.  The 'fileencoding'
option (without s at the end) is set to the detected value.  In this case it
is "utf-16le".  That means it's Unicode, 16-bit and little-endian.  This
file format is common on MS-Windows (e.g., for registry files).
   When writing the file, Vim will compare 'fileencoding' with 'encoding'.  If
they are different, the text will be converted.
   An empty value for 'fileencoding' means that no conversion is to be done.
Thus the text is assumed to be encoded with 'encoding'.

If the default 'fileencodings' value is not good for you, set it to the
encodings you want Vim to try.  Only when a value is found to be invalid will
the next one be used.  Putting "latin1" first doesn't work, because it is
never illegal.  An example, to fall back to Japanese when the file doesn't
have a BOM and isn't utf-8: >

	:set fileencodings=ucs-bom,utf-8,sjis

See |encoding-values| for suggested values.  Other values may work as well.
This depends on the conversion available.


FORCING AN ENCODING

If the automatic detection doesn't work you must tell Vim what encoding the
file is.  Example: >

	:edit ++enc=koi8-r russian.txt

The "++enc" part specifies the name of the encoding to be used for this file
only.  Vim will convert the file from the specified encoding, Russian in this
example, to 'encoding'.  'fileencoding' will also be set to the specified
encoding, so that the reverse conversion can be done when writing the file.
   The same argument can be used when writing the file.  This way you can
actually use Vim to convert a file.  Example: >

	:write ++enc=utf-8 russian.txt
<
	Note:
	Conversion may result in lost characters.  Conversion from an encoding
	to Unicode and back is mostly free of this problem, unless there are
	illegal characters.  Conversion from Unicode to other encodings often
	loses information when there was more than one language in the file.

==============================================================================
*45.5*	Entering language text

Computer keyboards don't have much more than a hundred keys.  Some languages
have thousands of characters, Unicode has over hundred thousand.  So how do
you type these characters?
   First of all, when you don't use too many of the special characters, you
can use digraphs.  This was already explained in |24.9|.
   When you use a language that uses many more characters than keys on your
keyboard, you will want to use an Input Method (IM).  This requires learning
the translation from typed keys to resulting character.  When you need an IM
you probably already have one on your system.  It should work with Vim like
with other programs.  For details see |mbyte-XIM| for the X Window system and
|mbyte-IME| for MS-Windows.


KEYMAPS

For some languages the character set is different from latin, but uses a
similar number of characters.  It's possible to map keys to characters.  Vim
uses keymaps for this.
   Suppose you want to type Hebrew.  You can load the keymap like this: >

	:set keymap=hebrew

Vim will try to find a keymap file for you.  This depends on the value of
'encoding'.  If no matching file was found, you will get an error message.

Now you can type Hebrew in Insert mode.  In Normal mode, and when typing a ":"
command, Vim automatically switches to English.  You can use this command to
switch between Hebrew and English: >

	CTRL-^

This only works in Insert mode and Command-line mode.  In Normal mode it does
something completely different (jumps to alternate file).
   The usage of the keymap is indicated in the mode message, if you have the
'showmode' option set.  In the GUI Vim will indicate the usage of keymaps with
a different cursor color.
   You can also change the usage of the keymap with the 'iminsert' and
'imsearch' options.

To see the list of mappings, use this command: >

	:lmap

To find out which keymap files are available, in the GUI you can use the
Edit/Keymap menu.  Otherwise you can use this command: >

	:echo globpath(&rtp, "keymap/*.vim")


DO-IT-YOURSELF KEYMAPS

You can create your own keymap file.  It's not very difficult.  Start with
a keymap file that is similar to the language you want to use.  Copy it to the
"keymap" directory in your runtime directory.  For example, for Unix, you
would use the directory "~/.vim/keymap".
   The name of the keymap file must look like this:

	keymap/{name}.vim ~
or
	keymap/{name}_{encoding}.vim ~

{name} is the name of the keymap.  Chose a name that is obvious, but different
from existing keymaps (unless you want to replace an existing keymap file).
{name} cannot contain an underscore.  Optionally, add the encoding used after
an underscore.  Examples:

	keymap/hebrew.vim ~
	keymap/hebrew_utf-8.vim ~

The contents of the file should be self-explanatory.  Look at a few of the
keymaps that are distributed with Vim.  For the details, see |mbyte-keymap|.


LAST RESORT

If all other methods fail, you can enter any character with CTRL-V:

	encoding   type			range ~
	8-bit	   CTRL-V 123		decimal 0-255
	8-bit	   CTRL-V x a1		hexadecimal 00-ff
	16-bit     CTRL-V u 013b	hexadecimal 0000-ffff
	31-bit	   CTRL-V U 001303a4	hexadecimal 00000000-7fffffff

Don't type the spaces.  See |i_CTRL-V_digit| for the details.

			 Search commands and patterns


In chapter 3 a few simple search patterns were mentioned |03.9|.  Vim can do
much more complex searches.  This chapter explains the most often used ones.
A detailed specification can be found here: |pattern|

|27.1|	Ignoring case
|27.2|	Wrapping around the file end
|27.3|	Offsets
|27.4|	Matching multiple times
|27.5|	Alternatives
|27.6|	Character ranges
|27.7|	Character classes
|27.8|	Matching a line break
|27.9|	Examples

     Next chapter: |usr_28.txt|  Folding
 Previous chapter: |usr_26.txt|  Repeating
Table of contents: |usr_toc.txt|

==============================================================================
*27.1*	Ignoring case

By default, Vim's searches are case sensitive.  Therefore, "include",
"INCLUDE", and "Include" are three different words and a search will match
only one of them.
   Now switch on the 'ignorecase' option: >

	:set ignorecase

Search for "include" again, and now it will match "Include", "INCLUDE" and
"InClUDe".  (Set the 'hlsearch' option to quickly see where a pattern
matches.)
   You can switch this off again with: >

	:set noignorecase

But let's keep it set, and search for "INCLUDE".  It will match exactly the
same text as "include" did.  Now set the 'smartcase' option: >

	:set ignorecase smartcase

If you have a pattern with at least one uppercase character, the search
becomes case sensitive.  The idea is that you didn't have to type that
uppercase character, so you must have done it because you wanted case to
match.  That's smart!
    With these two options set you find the following matches:

	pattern			matches	~
	word			word, Word, WORD, WoRd, etc.
	Word			Word
	WORD			WORD
	WoRd			WoRd


CASE IN ONE PATTERN

If you want to ignore case for one specific pattern, you can do this by
prepending the "\c" string.  Using "\C" will make the pattern to match case.
This overrules the 'ignorecase' and 'smartcase' options, when "\c" or "\C" is
used their value doesn't matter.

	pattern			matches	~
	\Cword			word
	\CWord			Word
	\cword			word, Word, WORD, WoRd, etc.
	\cWord			word, Word, WORD, WoRd, etc.

A big advantage of using "\c" and "\C" is that it sticks with the pattern.
Thus if you repeat a pattern from the search history, the same will happen, no
matter if 'ignorecase' or 'smartcase' was changed.

	Note:
	The use of "\" items in search patterns depends on the 'magic' option.
	In this chapter we will assume 'magic' is on, because that is the
	standard and recommended setting.  If you would change 'magic', many
	search patterns would suddenly become invalid.

	Note:
	If your search takes much longer than you expected, you can interrupt
	it with CTRL-C on Unix and  CTRL-Break on MS-DOS and MS-Windows.

==============================================================================
*27.2*	Wrapping around the file end

By default, a forward search starts searching for the given string at the
current cursor location.  It then proceeds to the end of the file.  If it has
not found the string by that time, it starts from the beginning and searches
from the start of the file to the cursor location.
   Keep in mind that when repeating the "n" command to search for the next
match, you eventually get back to the first match.  If you don't notice this
you keep searching forever!  To give you a hint, Vim displays this message:

	search hit BOTTOM, continuing at TOP ~

If you use the "?" command, to search in the other direction, you get this
message:

	search hit TOP, continuing at BOTTOM ~

Still, you don't know when you are back at the first match.  One way to see
this is by switching on the 'ruler' option: >

	:set ruler

Vim will display the cursor position in the lower righthand corner of the
window (in the status line if there is one).  It looks like this:

	101,29       84% ~

The first number is the line number of the cursor.  Remember the line number
where you started, so that you can check if you passed this position again.


NOT WRAPPING

To turn off search wrapping, use the following command: >

	:set nowrapscan

Now when the search hits the end of the file, an error message displays:

	E385: search hit BOTTOM without match for: forever ~

Thus you can find all matches by going to the start of the file with "gg" and
keep searching until you see this message.
   If you search in the other direction, using "?", you get:

	E384: search hit TOP without match for: forever ~

==============================================================================
*27.3*	Offsets

By default, the search command leaves the cursor positioned on the beginning
of the pattern.  You can tell Vim to leave it some other place by specifying
an offset.  For the forward search command "/", the offset is specified by
appending a slash (/) and the offset: >

	/default/2

This command searches for the pattern "default" and then moves to the
beginning of the second line past the pattern.  Using this command on the
paragraph above, Vim finds the word "default" in the first line.  Then the
cursor is moved two lines down and lands on "an offset".

If the offset is a simple number, the cursor will be placed at the beginning
of the line that many lines from the match.  The offset number can be positive
or negative.  If it is positive, the cursor moves down that many lines; if
negative, it moves up.


CHARACTER OFFSETS

The "e" offset indicates an offset from the end of the match.  It moves the
cursor onto the last character of the match.  The command: >

	/const/e

puts the cursor on the "t" of "const".
   From that position, adding a number moves forward that many characters.
This command moves to the character just after the match: >

	/const/e+1

A positive number moves the cursor to the right, a negative number moves it to
the left.  For example: >

	/const/e-1

moves the cursor to the "s" of "const".

If the offset begins with "b", the cursor moves to the beginning of the
pattern.  That's not very useful, since leaving out the "b" does the same
thing.  It does get useful when a number is added or subtracted.  The cursor
then goes forward or backward that many characters.  For example: >

	/const/b+2

Moves the cursor to the beginning of the match and then two characters to the
right.  Thus it lands on the "n".


REPEATING

To repeat searching for the previously used search pattern, but with a
different offset, leave out the pattern: >

	/that
	//e

Is equal to: >

	/that/e

To repeat with the same offset: >

	/

"n" does the same thing.  To repeat while removing a previously used offset: >

	//


SEARCHING BACKWARDS

The "?" command uses offsets in the same way, but you must use "?" to separate
the offset from the pattern, instead of "/": >

	?const?e-2

The "b" and "e" keep their meaning, they don't change direction with the use
of "?".


START POSITION

When starting a search, it normally starts at the cursor position.  When you
specify a line offset, this can cause trouble.  For example: >

	/const/-2

This finds the next word "const" and then moves two lines up.  If you
use "n" to search again, Vim could start at the current position and find the same
"const" match.  Then using the offset again, you would be back where you started.
You would be stuck!
   It could be worse: Suppose there is another match with "const" in the next
line.  Then repeating the forward search would find this match and move two
lines up.  Thus you would actually move the cursor back!

When you specify a character offset, Vim will compensate for this.  Thus the
search starts a few characters forward or backward, so that the same match
isn't found again.

==============================================================================
*27.4*	Matching multiple times

The "*" item specifies that the item before it can match any number of times.
Thus: >

	/a*

matches "a", "aa", "aaa", etc.  But also "" (the empty string), because zero
times is included.
   The "*" only applies to the item directly before it.  Thus "ab*" matches
"a", "ab", "abb", "abbb", etc.  To match a whole string multiple times, it
must be grouped into one item.  This is done by putting "\(" before it and
"\)" after it.  Thus this command: >

	/\(ab\)*

Matches: "ab", "abab", "ababab", etc.  And also "".

To avoid matching the empty string, use "\+".  This makes the previous item
match one or more times. >

	/ab\+

Matches "ab", "abb", "abbb", etc.  It does not match "a" when no "b" follows.

To match an optional item, use "\=".  Example: >

	/folders\=

Matches "folder" and "folders".


SPECIFIC COUNTS

To match a specific number of items use the form "\{n,m}".  "n" and "m" are
numbers.  The item before it will be matched "n" to "m" times |inclusive|.
Example: >

	/ab\{3,5}

matches "abbb", "abbbb" and "abbbbb".
  When "n" is omitted, it defaults to zero.  When "m" is omitted it defaults
to infinity.  When ",m" is omitted, it matches exactly "n" times.
Examples:

	pattern		match count ~
	\{,4}		0, 1, 2, 3 or 4
	\{3,}		3, 4, 5, etc.
	\{0,1}		0 or 1, same as \=
	\{0,}		0 or more, same as *
	\{1,}		1 or more, same as \+
	\{3}		3


MATCHING AS LITTLE AS POSSIBLE

The items so far match as many characters as they can find.  To match as few
as possible, use "\{-n,m}".  It works the same as "\{n,m}", except that the
minimal amount possible is used.
   For example, use: >

	/ab\{-1,3}

Will match "ab" in "abbb".  Actually, it will never match more than one b,
because there is no reason to match more.  It requires something else to force
it to match more than the lower limit.
   The same rules apply to removing "n" and "m".  It's even possible to remove
both of the numbers, resulting in "\{-}".  This matches the item before it
zero or more times, as few as possible.  The item by itself always matches
zero times.  It is useful when combined with something else.  Example: >

	/a.\{-}b

This matches "axb" in "axbxb".  If this pattern would be used: >

	/a.*b

It would try to match as many characters as possible with ".*", thus it
matches "axbxb" as a whole.

==============================================================================
*27.5*	Alternatives

The "or" operator in a pattern is "\|".  Example: >

	/foo\|bar

This matches "foo" or "bar".  More alternatives can be concatenated: >

	/one\|two\|three

Matches "one", "two" and "three".
   To match multiple times, the whole thing must be placed in "\(" and "\)": >

	/\(foo\|bar\)\+

This matches "foo", "foobar", "foofoo", "barfoobar", etc.
   Another example: >

	/end\(if\|while\|for\)

This matches "endif", "endwhile" and "endfor".

A related item is "\&".  This requires that both alternatives match in the
same place.  The resulting match uses the last alternative.  Example: >

	/forever\&...

This matches "for" in "forever".  It will not match "fortuin", for example.

==============================================================================
*27.6*	Character ranges

To match "a", "b" or "c" you could use "/a\|b\|c".  When you want to match all
letters from "a" to "z" this gets very long.  There is a shorter method: >

	/[a-z]

The [] construct matches a single character.  Inside you specify which
characters to match.  You can include a list of characters, like this: >

	/[0123456789abcdef]

This will match any of the characters included.  For consecutive characters
you can specify the range.  "0-3" stands for "0123".  "w-z" stands for "wxyz".
Thus the same command as above can be shortened to: >

	/[0-9a-f]

To match the "-" character itself make it the first or last one in the range.
These special characters are accepted to make it easier to use them inside a
[] range (they can actually be used anywhere in the search pattern):

	\e	<Esc>
	\t	<Tab>
	\r	<CR>
	\b	<BS>

There are a few more special cases for [] ranges, see |/[]| for the whole
story.


COMPLEMENTED RANGE

To avoid matching a specific character, use "^" at the start of the range.
The [] item then matches everything but the characters included.  Example: >

	/"[^"]*"
<
	 "	  a double quote
	  [^"]	  any character that is not a double quote
	      *	  as many as possible
	       "  a double quote again

This matches "foo" and "3!x", including the double quotes.


PREDEFINED RANGES

A number of ranges are used very often.  Vim provides a shortcut for these.
For example: >

	/\a

Finds alphabetic characters.  This is equal to using "/[a-zA-Z]".  Here are a
few more of these:

	item	matches			equivalent ~
	\d	digit			[0-9]
	\D	non-digit		[^0-9]
	\x	hex digit		[0-9a-fA-F]
	\X	non-hex digit		[^0-9a-fA-F]
	\s	white space		[ 	]     (<Tab> and <Space>)
	\S	non-white characters	[^ 	]     (not <Tab> and <Space>)
	\l	lowercase alpha		[a-z]
	\L	non-lowercase alpha	[^a-z]
	\u	uppercase alpha		[A-Z]
	\U	non-uppercase alpha	[^A-Z]

	Note:
	Using these predefined ranges works a lot faster than the character
	range it stands for.
	These items can not be used inside [].  Thus "[\d\l]" does NOT work to
	match a digit or lowercase alpha.  Use "\(\d\|\l\)" instead.

See |/\s| for the whole list of these ranges.

==============================================================================
*27.7*	Character classes

The character range matches a fixed set of characters.  A character class is
similar, but with an essential difference: The set of characters can be
redefined without changing the search pattern.
   For example, search for this pattern: >

	/\f\+

The "\f" items stands for file name characters.  Thus this matches a sequence
of characters that can be a file name.
   Which characters can be part of a file name depends on the system you are
using.  On MS-Windows, the backslash is included, on Unix it is not.  This is
specified with the 'isfname' option.  The default value for Unix is: >

	:set isfname
	isfname=@,48-57,/,.,-,_,+,,,#,$,%,~,=

For other systems the default value is different.  Thus you can make a search
pattern with "\f" to match a file name, and it will automatically adjust to
the system you are using it on.

	Note:
	Actually, Unix allows using just about any character in a file name,
	including white space.  Including these characters in 'isfname' would
	be theoretically correct.  But it would make it impossible to find the
	end of a file name in text.  Thus the default value of 'isfname' is a
	compromise.

The character classes are:

	item	matches				option ~
	\i	identifier characters		'isident'
	\I	like \i, excluding digits
	\k	keyword characters		'iskeyword'
	\K	like \k, excluding digits
	\p	printable characters		'isprint'
	\P	like \p, excluding digits
	\f	file name characters		'isfname'
	\F	like \f, excluding digits

==============================================================================
*27.8*	Matching a line break

Vim can find a pattern that includes a line break.  You need to specify where
the line break happens, because all items mentioned so far don't match a line
break.
   To check for a line break in a specific place, use the "\n" item: >

	/the\nword

This will match at a line that ends in "the" and the next line starts with
"word".  To match "the word" as well, you need to match a space or a line
break.  The item to use for it is "\_s": >

	/the\_sword

To allow any amount of white space: >

	/the\_s\+word

This also matches when "the  " is at the end of a line and "   word" at the
start of the next one.

"\s" matches white space, "\_s" matches white space or a line break.
Similarly, "\a" matches an alphabetic character, and "\_a" matches an
alphabetic character or a line break.  The other character classes and ranges
can be modified in the same way by inserting a "_".

Many other items can be made to match a line break by prepending "\_".  For
example: "\_." matches any character or a line break.

	Note:
	"\_.*" matches everything until the end of the file.  Be careful with
	this, it can make a search command very slow.

Another example is "\_[]", a character range that includes a line break: >

	/"\_[^"]*"

This finds a text in double quotes that may be split up in several lines.

==============================================================================
*27.9*	Examples

Here are a few search patterns you might find useful.  This shows how the
items mentioned above can be combined.


FINDING A CALIFORNIA LICENSE PLATE

A sample license plate number is "1MGU103".  It has one digit, three uppercase
letters and three digits.  Directly putting this into a search pattern: >

	/\d\u\u\u\d\d\d

Another way is to specify that there are three digits and letters with a
count: >

	/\d\u\{3}\d\{3}

Using [] ranges instead: >

	/[0-9][A-Z]\{3}[0-9]\{3}

Which one of these you should use?  Whichever one you can remember.  The
simple way you can remember is much faster than the fancy way that you can't.
If you can remember them all, then avoid the last one, because it's both more
typing and slower to execute.


FINDING AN IDENTIFIER

In C programs (and many other computer languages) an identifier starts with a
letter and further consists of letters and digits.  Underscores can be used
too.  This can be found with: >

	/\<\h\w*\>

"\<" and "\>" are used to find only whole words.  "\h" stands for "[A-Za-z_]"
and "\w" for "[0-9A-Za-z_]".

	Note:
	"\<" and "\>" depend on the 'iskeyword' option.  If it includes "-",
	for example, then "ident-" is not matched.  In this situation use: >

		/\w\@<!\h\w*\w\@!
<
	This checks if "\w" does not match before or after the identifier.
	See |/\@<!| and |/\@!|.

		  VIM REFERENCE MANUAL    by Bram Moolenaar


This file is about indenting C programs and other files.

1. Indenting C style programs	|C-indenting|
2. Indenting by expression	|indent-expression|

==============================================================================
1. Indenting C style programs				*C-indenting*

The basics for C style indenting are explained in section |30.2| of the user
manual.

Vim has options for automatically indenting C style program files. Many
programming languages including Java and C++ follow very closely the
formatting conventions established with C.  These options affect only the
indent and do not perform other formatting.  There are additional options that
affect other kinds of formatting as well as indenting, see |format-comments|,
|fo-table|, |gq| and |formatting| for the main ones.

Note that this will not work when the |+smartindent| or |+cindent| features
have been disabled at compile time.

There are in fact four main methods available for indentation, each one
overrides the previous if it is enabled, or non-empty for 'indentexpr':
'autoindent'	uses the indent from the previous line.
'smartindent'	is like 'autoindent' but also recognizes some C syntax to
		increase/reduce the indent where appropriate.
'cindent'	Works more cleverly than the other two and is configurable to
		different indenting styles.
'indentexpr'	The most flexible of all: Evaluates an expression to compute
		the indent of a line.  When non-empty this method overrides
		the other ones.  See |indent-expression|.
The rest of this section describes the 'cindent' option.

Note that 'cindent' indenting does not work for every code scenario.  Vim
is not a C compiler: it does not recognize all syntax.  One requirement is
that toplevel functions have a '{' in the first column.  Otherwise they are
easily confused with declarations.

These four options control C program indenting:
'cindent'	Enables Vim to perform C program indenting automatically.
'cinkeys'	Specifies which keys trigger reindenting in insert mode.
'cinoptions'	Sets your preferred indent style.
'cinwords'	Defines keywords that start an extra indent in the next line.

If 'lisp' is not on and 'equalprg' is empty, the "=" operator indents using
Vim's built-in algorithm rather than calling an external program.

See |autocommand| for how to set the 'cindent' option automatically for C code
files and reset it for others.

					*cinkeys-format* *indentkeys-format*
The 'cinkeys' option is a string that controls Vim's indenting in response to
typing certain characters or commands in certain contexts.  Note that this not
only triggers C-indenting.  When 'indentexpr' is not empty 'indentkeys' is
used instead.  The format of 'cinkeys' and 'indentkeys' is equal.

The default is "0{,0},0),:,0#,!^F,o,O,e" which specifies that indenting occurs
as follows:

	"0{"	if you type '{' as the first character in a line
	"0}"	if you type '}' as the first character in a line
	"0)"	if you type ')' as the first character in a line
	":"	if you type ':' after a label or case statement
	"0#"	if you type '#' as the first character in a line
	"!^F"	if you type CTRL-F (which is not inserted)
	"o"	if you type a <CR> anywhere or use the "o" command (not in
		insert mode!)
	"O"	if you use the "O" command (not in insert mode!)
	"e"	if you type the second 'e' for an "else" at the start of a
		line

Characters that can precede each key:				*i_CTRL-F*
!	When a '!' precedes the key, Vim will not insert the key but will
	instead reindent the current line.  This allows you to define a
	command key for reindenting the current line.  CTRL-F is the default
	key for this.  Be careful if you define CTRL-I for this because CTRL-I
	is the ASCII code for <Tab>.
*	When a '*' precedes the key, Vim will reindent the line before
	inserting the key.  If 'cinkeys' contains "*<Return>", Vim reindents
	the current line before opening a new line.
0	When a zero precedes the key (but appears after '!' or '*') Vim will
	reindent the line only if the key is the first character you type in
	the line.  When used before "=" Vim will only reindent the line if
	there is only white space before the word.

When neither '!' nor '*' precedes the key, Vim reindents the line after you
type the key.  So ';' sets the indentation of a line which includes the ';'.

Special key names:
<>	Angle brackets mean spelled-out names of keys.  For example: "<Up>",
	"<Ins>" (see |key-notation|).
^	Letters preceded by a caret (^) are control characters.  For example:
	"^F" is CTRL-F.
o	Reindent a line when you use the "o" command or when Vim opens a new
	line below the current one (e.g., when you type <Enter> in insert
	mode).
O	Reindent a line when you use the "O" command.
e	Reindent a line that starts with "else" when you type the second 'e'.
:	Reindent a line when a ':' is typed which is after a label or case
	statement.  Don't reindent for a ":" in "class::method" for C++.  To
	Reindent for any ":", use "<:>".
=word	Reindent when typing the last character of "word".  "word" may
	actually be part of another word.  Thus "=end" would cause reindenting
	when typing the "d" in "endif" or "endwhile".  But not when typing
	"bend".  Also reindent when completion produces a word that starts
	with "word".  "0=word" reindents when there is only white space before
	the word.
=~word	Like =word, but ignore case.

If you really want to reindent when you type 'o', 'O', 'e', '0', '<', '>',
'*', ':' or '!', use "<o>", "<O>", "<e>", "<0>", "<<>", "<>>", "<*>", "<:>" or
"<!>", respectively, for those keys.

For an emacs-style indent mode where lines aren't indented every time you
press <Enter> but only if you press <Tab>, I suggest:
	:set cinkeys=0{,0},:,0#,!<Tab>,!^F
You might also want to switch off 'autoindent' then.

Note: If you change the current line's indentation manually, Vim ignores the
cindent settings for that line.  This prevents vim from reindenting after you
have changed the indent by typing <BS>, <Tab>, or <Space> in the indent or
used CTRL-T or CTRL-D.

						*cinoptions-values*
The 'cinoptions' option sets how Vim performs indentation.  The value after
the option character can be one of these (N is any number):
	N	indent N spaces
	-N	indent N spaces to the left
	Ns	N times 'shiftwidth' spaces
	-Ns	N times 'shiftwidth' spaces to the left

In the list below,
"N" represents a number of your choice (the number can be negative).  When
there is an 's' after the number, Vim multiplies the number by 'shiftwidth':
"1s" is 'shiftwidth', "2s" is two times 'shiftwidth', etc.  You can use a
decimal point, too: "-0.5s" is minus half a 'shiftwidth'.
The examples below assume a 'shiftwidth' of 4.
							*cino->*
	>N    Amount added for "normal" indent.  Used after a line that should
	      increase the indent (lines starting with "if", an opening brace,
	      etc.).  (default 'shiftwidth').

		cino=		    cino=>2		cino=>2s >
		  if (cond)	      if (cond)		  if (cond)
		  {		      {			  {
		      foo;		foo;			  foo;
		  }		      }			  }
<
							*cino-e*
	eN    Add N to the prevailing indent inside a set of braces if the
	      opening brace at the End of the line (more precise: is not the
	      first character in a line).  This is useful if you want a
	      different indent when the '{' is at the start of the line from
	      when '{' is at the end of the line.  (default 0).

		cino=		    cino=e2		cino=e-2 >
		  if (cond) {	      if (cond) {	  if (cond) {
		      foo;		    foo;	    foo;

			c3,C0,/0,(2s,us,U0,w0,W0,k0,m0,j0,J0,)20,*70,#0

Vim puts a line in column 1 if:
- It starts with '#' (preprocessor directives), if 'cinkeys' contains '#0'.
- It starts with a label (a keyword followed by ':', other than "case" and
  "default") and 'cinoptions' does not contain an 'L' entry with a positive
  value.
- Any combination of indentations causes the line to have less than 0
  indentation.

==============================================================================
2. Indenting by expression				*indent-expression*

The basics for using flexible indenting are explained in section |30.3| of the
user manual.

If you want to write your own indent file, it must set the 'indentexpr'
option.  Setting the 'indentkeys' option is often useful.  See the
$VIMRUNTIME/indent directory for examples.


REMARKS ABOUT SPECIFIC INDENT FILES ~


CLOJURE					*ft-clojure-indent* *clojure-indent*

Clojure indentation differs somewhat from traditional Lisps, due in part to
the use of square and curly brackets, and otherwise by community convention.
These conventions are not universally followed, so the Clojure indent script
offers a few configurable options, listed below.

If the current vim does not include searchpairpos(), the indent script falls
back to normal 'lisp' indenting, and the following options are ignored.

							*g:clojure_maxlines*

Set maximum scan distance of searchpairpos(). Larger values trade performance
for correctness when dealing with very long forms. A value of 0 will scan
without limits.
>
	" Default
	let g:clojure_maxlines = 100
<
						*g:clojure_fuzzy_indent*
					*g:clojure_fuzzy_indent_patterns*
					*g:clojure_fuzzy_indent_blacklist*

The 'lispwords' option is a list of comma-separated words that mark special
forms whose subforms must be indented with two spaces.

For example:
>
	(defn bad []
	      "Incorrect indentation")

	(defn good []
	  "Correct indentation")
<
If you would like to specify 'lispwords' with a |pattern| instead, you can use
the fuzzy indent feature:
>
	" Default
	let g:clojure_fuzzy_indent = 1
	let g:clojure_fuzzy_indent_patterns = ['^with', '^def', '^let']
	let g:clojure_fuzzy_indent_blacklist =
		\ ['-fn$', '\v^with-%(meta|out-str|loading-context)$']

	" Legacy comma-delimited string version; the list format above is
	" recommended. Note that patterns are implicitly anchored with ^ and $
	let g:clojure_fuzzy_indent_patterns = 'with.*,def.*,let.*'
<
|g:clojure_fuzzy_indent_patterns| and |g:clojure_fuzzy_indent_blacklist| are
|Lists| of patterns that will be matched against the unquoted, unqualified
symbol at the head of a list. This means that a pattern like "^foo" will match
all these candidates: "foobar", "my.ns/foobar", and "#'foobar".

Each candidate word is tested for special treatment in this order:

	1. Return true if word is literally in 'lispwords'
	2. Return false if word matches a pattern in
	   |g:clojure_fuzzy_indent_blacklist|
	3. Return true if word matches a pattern in
	   |g:clojure_fuzzy_indent_patterns|
	4. Return false and indent normally otherwise

					*g:clojure_special_indent_words*

Some forms in Clojure are indented so that every subform is indented only two
spaces, regardless of 'lispwords'. If you have a custom construct that should
be indented in this idiosyncratic fashion, you can add your symbols to the
default list below.
>
	" Default
	let g:clojure_special_indent_words =
	   \ 'deftype,defrecord,reify,proxy,extend-type,extend-protocol,letfn'
<
					*g:clojure_align_multiline_strings*

Align subsequent lines in multiline strings to the column after the opening
quote, instead of the same column.

For example:
>
	(def default
	  "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipisicing elit, sed do
	  eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua. Ut
	  enim ad minim veniam, quis nostrud exercitation ullamco laboris
	  nisi ut aliquip ex ea commodo consequat.")

	(def aligned
	  "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipisicing elit, sed do
	   eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua. Ut
	   enim ad minim veniam, quis nostrud exercitation ullamco laboris
	   nisi ut aliquip ex ea commodo consequat.")
<
This option is off by default.
>
	" Default
	let g:clojure_align_multiline_strings = 0
<
						*g:clojure_align_subforms*

By default, parenthesized compound forms that look like function calls and
whose head subform is on its own line have subsequent subforms indented by
two spaces relative to the opening paren:
>
	(foo
	  bar
	  baz)
<
Setting this option changes this behavior so that all subforms are aligned to
the same column, emulating the default behavior of clojure-mode.el:
>
	(foo
	 bar
	 baz)
<
This option is off by default.
>
	" Default
	let g:clojure_align_subforms = 0
<

FORTRAN							*ft-fortran-indent*

Block if, select case, where, and forall constructs are indented.  So are
type, interface, associate, block, and enum constructs.  The indenting of
subroutines, functions, modules, and program blocks is optional.  Comments,
labelled statements and continuation lines are indented if the Fortran is in
free source form, whereas they are not indented if the Fortran is in fixed
source form because of the left margin requirements.  Hence manual indent
corrections will be necessary for labelled statements and continuation lines
when fixed source form is being used.  For further discussion of the method
used for the detection of source format see |ft-fortran-syntax|.

Do loops ~
All do loops are left unindented by default.  Do loops can be unstructured in
Fortran with (possibly multiple) loops ending on a labelled executable
statement of almost arbitrary type.  Correct indentation requires
compiler-quality parsing.  Old code with do loops ending on labelled statements
of arbitrary type can be indented with elaborate programs such as Tidy
(http://www.unb.ca/chem/ajit/f_tidy.htm).  Structured do/continue loops are
also left unindented because continue statements are also used for purposes
other than ending a do loop.  Programs such as Tidy can convert structured
do/continue loops to the do/enddo form.  Do loops of the do/enddo variety can
be indented.  If you use only structured loops of the do/enddo form, you should
declare this by setting the fortran_do_enddo variable in your .vimrc as
follows >

   let fortran_do_enddo=1

in which case do loops will be indented.  If all your loops are of do/enddo
type only in, say, .f90 files, then you should set a buffer flag with an
autocommand such as >

  au! BufRead,BufNewFile *.f90 let b:fortran_do_enddo=1

to get do loops indented in .f90 files and left alone in Fortran files with
other extensions such as .for.

Program units ~
The indenting of program units (subroutines, functions, modules, and program
blocks) is enabled by default but can be suppressed if a lighter, screen-width
preserving indent style is desired.  To suppress the indenting of program
units for all fortran files set the global fortran_indent_less variable in
your .vimrc as follows >

  let fortran_indent_less=1

A finer level of suppression can be achieved by setting the corresponding
buffer-local variable as follows >

  let b:fortran_indent_less=1


HTML				*ft-html-indent* *html-indent* *html-indenting*

This is about variables you can set in your vimrc to customize HTML indenting.

You can set the indent for the first line after <script> and <style>
"blocktags" (default "zero"): >

      :let g:html_indent_script1 = "inc"
      :let g:html_indent_style1 = "inc"
<
      VALUE	MEANING ~
      "zero"	zero indent
      "auto"	auto indent (same indent as the blocktag)
      "inc"	auto indent + one indent step

Many tags increase the indent for what follows per default (see "Add Indent
Tags" in the script).  You can add further tags with: >

      :let g:html_indent_inctags = "html,body,head,tbody"

You can also remove such tags with: >

      :let g:html_indent_autotags = "th,td,tr,tfoot,thead"

Default value is empty for both variables.  Note: the initial "inctags" are
only defined once per Vim session.

User variables are only read when the script is sourced.  To enable your
changes during a session, without reloading the HTML file, you can manually
do: >

      :call HtmlIndent_CheckUserSettings()

Detail:
  Calculation of indent inside "blocktags" with "alien" content:
      BLOCKTAG   INDENT EXPR	    WHEN APPLICABLE ~
      <script> : {customizable}	    if first line of block
	       : cindent(v:lnum)    if attributes empty or contain "java"
	       : -1		    else (vbscript, tcl, ...)
      <style>  : {customizable}	    if first line of block
	       : GetCSSIndent()	    else
      <!-- --> : -1


PHP				*ft-php-indent* *php-indent* *php-indenting*

NOTE:	PHP files will be indented correctly only if PHP |syntax| is active.

If you are editing a file in Unix 'fileformat' and '\r' characters are present
before new lines, indentation won't proceed correctly ; you have to remove
those useless characters first with a command like: >

    :%s /\r$//g

Or, you can simply |:let| the variable PHP_removeCRwhenUnix to 1 and the
script will silently remove them when Vim loads a PHP file (at each |BufRead|).

OPTIONS: ~

PHP indenting can be altered in several ways by modifying the values of some
global variables:

					*php-comment* *PHP_autoformatcomment*
To not enable auto-formating of comments by default (if you want to use your
own 'formatoptions'): >
    :let g:PHP_autoformatcomment = 0

Else, 't' will be removed from the 'formatoptions' string and "qrowcb" will be
added, see |fo-table| for more information.
-------------

							*PHP_outdentSLComments*
To add extra indentation to single-line comments: >
    :let g:PHP_outdentSLComments = N

With N being the number of 'shiftwidth' to add.

Only single-line comments will be affected such as: >
    # Comment
    // Comment
    /* Comment */
-------------

							*PHP_default_indenting*
To add extra indentation to every PHP lines with N being the number of
'shiftwidth' to add: >
    :let g:PHP_default_indenting = N

For example, with N = 1, this will give:
>
    <?php
	if (!isset($History_lst_sel))
	    if (!isset($History_lst_sel))
		if (!isset($History_lst_sel)) {
		    $History_lst_sel=0;
		} else
		    $foo="bar";

	$command_hist = TRUE;
    ?>
(Notice the extra indentation between the PHP container markers and the code)
-------------

							*PHP_outdentphpescape*
To indent PHP escape tags as the surrounding non-PHP code (only affects the
PHP escape tags): >
:let g:PHP_outdentphpescape = 0
-------------

							*PHP_removeCRwhenUnix*
To automatically remove '\r' characters when the 'fileformat' is set to Unix: >
    :let g:PHP_removeCRwhenUnix = 1
-------------

							*PHP_BracesAtCodeLevel*
To indent braces at the same level than the code they contain: >
    :let g:PHP_BracesAtCodeLevel = 1
    
This will give the following result: >
    if ($foo)
	{
	foo();
	}
Instead of: >
    if ($foo)
    {
	foo();
    }

NOTE:	Indenting will be a bit slower if this option is used because some
	optimizations won't be available.
-------------

							*PHP_vintage_case_default_indent*
To indent 'case:' and 'default:' statements in switch() blocks: >
    :let g:PHP_vintage_case_default_indent = 1

In PHP braces are not required inside 'case/default' blocks therefore 'case:'
and 'default:' are indented at the same level than the 'switch()' to avoid
meaningless indentation. You can use the above option to return to the
traditional way.


PYTHON							*ft-python-indent*

The amount of indent can be set for the following situations.  The examples
given are the defaults.  Note that the variables are set to an expression, so
that you can change the value of 'shiftwidth' later.

Indent after an open paren: >
	let g:pyindent_open_paren = '&sw * 2'
Indent after a nested paren: >
	let g:pyindent_nested_paren = '&sw'
Indent for a continuation line: >
	let g:pyindent_continue = '&sw * 2'


R								*ft-r-indent*

Function arguments are aligned if they span for multiple lines. If you prefer
do not have the arguments of functions aligned, put in your |vimrc|:
>
   let r_indent_align_args = 0
<
All lines beginning with a comment character, #, get the same indentation
level of the normal R code. Users of Emacs/ESS may be used to have lines
beginning with a single # indented in the 40th column, ## indented as R code,
and ### not indented. If you prefer that lines beginning with comment
characters are aligned as they are by Emacs/ESS, put in your |vimrc|:
>
   let r_indent_ess_comments = 1
<
If you prefer that lines beginning with a single # are aligned at a column
different from the 40th one, you should set a new value to the variable
r_indent_comment_column, as in the example below:
>
   let r_indent_comment_column = 30
<
Any code after a line that ends with "<-" is indented. Emacs/ESS does not
indent the code if it is a top level function. If you prefer that the
Vim-R-plugin behaves like Emacs/ESS in this regard, put in your |vimrc|:
>
   let r_indent_ess_compatible = 1
<
Below is an example of indentation with and without this option enabled:
>
   ### r_indent_ess_compatible = 1           ### r_indent_ess_compatible = 0
   foo <-                                    foo <-
       function(x)                               function(x)
   {                                             {
       paste(x)                                      paste(x)
   }                                             }
<

SHELL							*ft-sh-indent*

The amount of indent applied under various circumstances in a shell file can
be configured by setting the following keys in the |Dictionary|
b:sh_indent_defaults to a specific amount or to a |Funcref| that references a
function that will return the amount desired:

b:sh_indent_options['default']	Default amount of indent.

b:sh_indent_options['continuation-line']
				Amount of indent to add to a continued line.

b:sh_indent_options['case-labels']
				Amount of indent to add for case labels.
				(not actually implemented)

b:sh_indent_options['case-statements']
				Amount of indent to add for case statements.

b:sh_indent_options['case-breaks']
				Amount of indent to add (or more likely
				remove) for case breaks.

VERILOG							*ft-verilog-indent*

General block statements such as if, for, case, always, initial, function,
specify and begin, etc., are indented.  The module block statements (first
level blocks) are not indented by default.  you can turn on the indent with
setting a variable in the .vimrc as follows: >

  let b:verilog_indent_modules = 1

then the module blocks will be indented.  To stop this, remove the variable: >

  :unlet b:verilog_indent_modules

To set the variable only for Verilog file.  The following statements can be
used: >

  au BufReadPost * if exists("b:current_syntax")
  au BufReadPost *   if b:current_syntax == "verilog"
  au BufReadPost *     let b:verilog_indent_modules = 1
  au BufReadPost *   endif
  au BufReadPost * endif

Furthermore, setting the variable b:verilog_indent_width to change the
indenting width (default is 'shiftwidth'): >

  let b:verilog_indent_width = 4
  let b:verilog_indent_width = &sw * 2

In addition, you can turn the verbose mode for debug issue: >

  let b:verilog_indent_verbose = 1

Make sure to do ":set cmdheight=2" first to allow the display of the message.


VHDL							*ft-vhdl-indent*

Alignment of generic/port mapping statements are performed by default. This
causes the following alignment example: >

  ENTITY sync IS
  PORT (
         clk        : IN  STD_LOGIC;
         reset_n    : IN  STD_LOGIC;
         data_input : IN  STD_LOGIC;
         data_out   : OUT STD_LOGIC
       );
  END ENTITY sync;

To turn this off, add >

  let g:vhdl_indent_genportmap = 0

to the .vimrc file, which causes the previous alignment example to change: >

  ENTITY sync IS
  PORT (
    clk        : IN  STD_LOGIC;
    reset_n    : IN  STD_LOGIC;
    data_input : IN  STD_LOGIC;
    data_out   : OUT STD_LOGIC
  );
  END ENTITY sync;

----------------------------------------

Alignment of right-hand side assignment "<=" statements are performed by
default. This causes the following alignment example: >

  sig_out <= (bus_a(1) AND
             (sig_b OR sig_c)) OR
             (bus_a(0) AND sig_d);

To turn this off, add >

  let g:vhdl_indent_rhsassign = 0

to the .vimrc file, which causes the previous alignment example to change: >

  sig_out <= (bus_a(1) AND
    (sig_b OR sig_c)) OR
    (bus_a(0) AND sig_d);

----------------------------------------

Full-line comments (lines that begin with "--") are indented to be aligned with
the very previous line's comment, PROVIDED that a whitespace follows after
"--".

For example: >

  sig_a <= sig_b; -- start of a comment
                  -- continuation of the comment
                  -- more of the same comment

While in Insert mode, after typing "-- " (note the space " "), hitting CTRL-F
will align the current "-- " with the previous line's "--".

If the very previous line does not contain "--", THEN the full-line comment
will be aligned with the start of the next non-blank line that is NOT a
full-line comment.

Indenting the following code: >

  sig_c <= sig_d; -- comment 0
         -- comment 1
               -- comment 2
    --debug_code:
    --PROCESS(debug_in)
         --BEGIN
            --  FOR i IN 15 DOWNTO 0 LOOP
             --    debug_out(8*i+7 DOWNTO 8*i) <= debug_in(15-i);
            --  END LOOP;
     --END PROCESS debug_code;

      -- comment 3
  sig_e <= sig_f; -- comment 4
           -- comment 5

results in: >

  sig_c <= sig_d; -- comment 0
                  -- comment 1
                  -- comment 2
  --debug_code:
  --PROCESS(debug_in)
  --BEGIN
  --  FOR i IN 15 DOWNTO 0 LOOP
  --    debug_out(8*i+7 DOWNTO 8*i) <= debug_in(15-i);
  --  END LOOP;
  --END PROCESS debug_code;

  -- comment 3
  sig_e <= sig_f; -- comment 4
                  -- comment 5

Notice that "--debug_code:" does not align with "-- comment 2"
because there is no whitespace that follows after "--" in "--debug_code:".

Given the dynamic nature of indenting comments, indenting should be done TWICE.
On the first pass, code will be indented. On the second pass, full-line
comments will be indented according to the correctly indented code.


VIM							*ft-vim-indent*

For indenting Vim scripts there is one variable that specifies the amount of
indent for a continuation line, a line that starts with a backslash: >

	:let g:vim_indent_cont = &sw * 3

Three times shiftwidth is the default value.

			     Moving around


Before you can insert or delete text the cursor has to be moved to the right
place.  Vim has a large number of commands to position the cursor.  This
chapter shows you how to use the most important ones.  You can find a list of
these commands below |Q_lr|.

|03.1|	Word movement
|03.2|	Moving to the start or end of a line
|03.3|	Moving to a character
|03.4|	Matching a parenthesis
|03.5|	Moving to a specific line
|03.6|	Telling where you are
|03.7|	Scrolling around
|03.8|	Simple searches
|03.9|	Simple search patterns
|03.10|	Using marks

==============================================================================
*03.1*	Word movement

To move the cursor forward one word, use the "w" command.  Like most Vim
commands, you can use a numeric prefix to move past multiple words.  For
example, "3w" moves three words.  This figure shows how it works:

	This is a line with example text ~
	  --->-->->----------------->
	   w  w  w    3w

Notice that "w" moves to the start of the next word if it already is at the
start of a word.
   The "b" command moves backward to the start of the previous word:

	This is a line with example text ~
	<----<--<-<---------<---
	   b   b b    2b      b

There is also the "e" command that moves to the next end of a word and "ge",
which moves to the previous end of a word:

	This is a line with example text ~
	   <-   <--- ----->   ---->
	   ge    ge     e       e

If you are at the last word of a line, the "w" command will take you to the
first word in the next line.  Thus you can use this to move through a
paragraph, much faster than using "l".  "b" does the same in the other
direction.

A word ends at a non-word character, such as a ".", "-" or ")".  To change
what Vim considers to be a word, see the 'iskeyword' option.
   It is also possible to move by white-space separated WORDs.  This is not a
word in the normal sense, that's why the uppercase is used.  The commands for
moving by WORDs are also uppercase, as this figure shows:

	       ge      b	  w				e
	       <-     <-	 --->			       --->
	This is-a line, with special/separated/words (and some more). ~
	   <----- <-----	 -------------------->	       ----->
	     gE      B			 W			 E

With this mix of lowercase and uppercase commands, you can quickly move
forward and backward through a paragraph.

==============================================================================
*03.2*	Moving to the start or end of a line

The "$" command moves the cursor to the end of a line.  If your keyboard has
an <End> key it will do the same thing.

The "^" command moves to the first non-blank character of the line.  The "0"
command (zero) moves to the very first character of the line.  The <Home> key
does the same thing.  In a picture:

		  ^
	     <------------
	.....This is a line with example text ~
	<-----------------   --------------->
		0		   $

(the "....." indicates blanks here)

   The "$" command takes a count, like most movement commands.  But moving to
the end of the line several times doesn't make sense.  Therefore it causes the
editor to move to the end of another line.  For example, "1$" moves you to
the end of the first line (the one you're on), "2$" to the end of the next
line, and so on.
   The "0" command doesn't take a count argument, because the "0" would be
part of the count.  Unexpectedly, using a count with "^" doesn't have any
effect.

==============================================================================
*03.3*	Moving to a character

One of the most useful movement commands is the single-character search
command.  The command "fx" searches forward in the line for the single
character x.  Hint: "f" stands for "Find".
   For example, you are at the beginning of the following line.  Suppose you
want to go to the h of human.  Just execute the command "fh" and the cursor
will be positioned over the h:

	To err is human.  To really foul up you need a computer. ~
	---------->--------------->
	    fh		 fy

This also shows that the command "fy" moves to the end of the word really.
   You can specify a count; therefore, you can go to the "l" of "foul" with
"3fl":

	To err is human.  To really foul up you need a computer. ~
		  --------------------->
			   3fl

The "F" command searches to the left:

	To err is human.  To really foul up you need a computer. ~
		  <---------------------
			    Fh

The "tx" command works like the "fx" command, except it stops one character
before the searched character.  Hint: "t" stands for "To".  The backward
version of this command is "Tx".

	To err is human.  To really foul up you need a computer. ~
		   <------------  ------------->
			Th		tn

These four commands can be repeated with ";".  "," repeats in the other
direction.  The cursor is never moved to another line.  Not even when the
sentence continues.

Sometimes you will start a search, only to realize that you have typed the
wrong command.  You type "f" to search backward, for example, only to realize
that you really meant "F".  To abort a search, press <Esc>.  So "f<Esc>" is an
aborted forward search and doesn't do anything.  Note: <Esc> cancels most
operations, not just searches.

==============================================================================
*03.4*	Matching a parenthesis

When writing a program you often end up with nested () constructs.  Then the
"%" command is very handy: It moves to the matching paren.  If the cursor is
on a "(" it will move to the matching ")".  If it's on a ")" it will move to
the matching "(".

			    %
			 <----->
		if (a == (b * c) / d) ~
		   <---------------->
			    %

This also works for [] and {} pairs.  (This can be defined with the
'matchpairs' option.)

When the cursor is not on a useful character, "%" will search forward to find
one.  Thus if the cursor is at the start of the line of the previous example,
"%" will search forward and find the first "(".  Then it moves to its match:

		if (a == (b * c) / d) ~
		---+---------------->
			   %

==============================================================================
*03.5*	Moving to a specific line

If you are a C or C++ programmer, you are familiar with error messages such as
the following:

	prog.c:33: j   undeclared (first use in this function) ~

This tells you that you might want to fix something on line 33.  So how do you
find line 33?  One way is to do "9999k" to go to the top of the file and "32j"
to go down thirty two lines.  It is not a good way, but it works.  A much
better way of doing things is to use the "G" command.  With a count, this
command positions you at the given line number.  For example, "33G" puts you
on line 33.  (For a better way of going through a compiler's error list, see
|usr_30.txt|, for information on the :make command.)
   With no argument, "G" positions you at the end of the file.  A quick way to
go to the start of a file use "gg".  "1G" will do the same, but is a tiny bit
more typing.

	    |	first line of a file   ^
	    |	text text text text    |
	    |	text text text text    |  gg
	7G  |	text text text text    |
	    |	text text text text
	    |	text text text text
	    V	text text text text    |
		text text text text    |  G
		text text text text    |
		last line of a file    V

Another way to move to a line is using the "%" command with a count.  For
example "50%" moves you to halfway the file.  "90%" goes to near the end.

The previous assumes that you want to move to a line in the file, no matter if
it's currently visible or not.  What if you want to move to one of the lines
you can see?  This figure shows the three commands you can use:

			+---------------------------+
		H -->	| text sample text	    |
			| sample text		    |
			| text sample text	    |
			| sample text		    |
		M -->	| text sample text	    |
			| sample text		    |
			| text sample text	    |
			| sample text		    |
		L -->	| text sample text	    |
			+---------------------------+

Hints: "H" stands for Home, "M" for Middle and "L" for Last.

==============================================================================
*03.6*	Telling where you are

To see where you are in a file, there are three ways:

1.  Use the CTRL-G command.  You get a message like this (assuming the 'ruler'
    option is off):

	"usr_03.txt" line 233 of 650 --35%-- col 45-52 ~

    This shows the name of the file you are editing, the line number where the
    cursor is, the total number of lines, the percentage of the way through
    the file and the column of the cursor.
       Sometimes you will see a split column number.  For example, "col 2-9".
    This indicates that the cursor is positioned on the second character, but
    because character one is a tab, occupying eight spaces worth of columns,
    the screen column is 9.

2.  Set the 'number' option.  This will display a line number in front of
    every line: >

	:set number
<
    To switch this off again: >

	:set nonumber
<
    Since 'number' is a boolean option, prepending "no" to its name has the
    effect of switching it off.  A boolean option has only these two values,
    it is either on or off.
       Vim has many options.  Besides the boolean ones there are options with
    a numerical value and string options.  You will see examples of this where
    they are used.

3.  Set the 'ruler' option.  This will display the cursor position in the
    lower right corner of the Vim window: >

	:set ruler

Using the 'ruler' option has the advantage that it doesn't take much room,
thus there is more space for your text.

==============================================================================
*03.7*	Scrolling around

The CTRL-U command scrolls down half a screen of text.  Think of looking
through a viewing window at the text and moving this window up by half the
height of the window.  Thus the window moves up over the text, which is
backward in the file.  Don't worry if you have a little trouble remembering
which end is up.  Most users have the same problem.
   The CTRL-D command moves the viewing window down half a screen in the file,
thus scrolls the text up half a screen.

				       +----------------+
				       | some text	|
				       | some text	|
				       | some text	|
	+---------------+	       | some text	|
	| some text	|  CTRL-U  --> |		|
	|		|	       | 123456		|
	| 123456	|	       +----------------+
	| 7890		|
	|		|	       +----------------+
	| example	|  CTRL-D -->  | 7890		|
	+---------------+	       |		|
				       | example	|
				       | example	|
				       | example	|
				       | example	|
				       +----------------+

To scroll one line at a time use CTRL-E (scroll up) and CTRL-Y (scroll down).
Think of CTRL-E to give you one line Extra.  (If you use MS-Windows compatible
key mappings CTRL-Y will redo a change instead of scroll.)

To scroll forward by a whole screen (except for two lines) use CTRL-F.  The
other way is backward, CTRL-B is the command to use.  Fortunately CTRL-F is
Forward and CTRL-B is Backward, that's easy to remember.

A common issue is that after moving down many lines with "j" your cursor is at
the bottom of the screen.  You would like to see the context of the line with
the cursor.  That's done with the "zz" command.

	+------------------+		 +------------------+
	| some text	   |		 | some text	    |
	| some text	   |		 | some text	    |
	| some text	   |		 | some text	    |
	| some text	   |   zz  -->	 | line with cursor |
	| some text	   |		 | some text	    |
	| some text	   |		 | some text	    |
	| line with cursor |		 | some text	    |
	+------------------+		 +------------------+

The "zt" command puts the cursor line at the top, "zb" at the bottom.  There
are a few more scrolling commands, see |Q_sc|.  To always keep a few lines of
context around the cursor, use the 'scrolloff' option.

==============================================================================
*03.8*	Simple searches

To search for a string, use the "/string" command.  To find the word include,
for example, use the command: >

	/include

You will notice that when you type the "/" the cursor jumps to the last line
of the Vim window, like with colon commands.  That is where you type the word.
You can press the backspace key (backarrow or <BS>) to make corrections.  Use
the <Left> and <Right> cursor keys when necessary.
   Pressing <Enter> executes the command.

	Note:
	The characters .*[]^%/\?~$ have special meanings.  If you want to use
	them in a search you must put a \ in front of them.  See below.

To find the next occurrence of the same string use the "n" command.  Use this
to find the first #include after the cursor: >

	/#include

And then type "n" several times.  You will move to each #include in the text.
You can also use a count if you know which match you want.  Thus "3n" finds
the third match.  Using a count with "/" doesn't work.

The "?" command works like "/" but searches backwards: >

	?word

The "N" command repeats the last search the opposite direction.  Thus using
"N" after a "/" command search backwards, using "N" after "?" searches
forward.


IGNORING CASE

Normally you have to type exactly what you want to find.  If you don't care
about upper or lowercase in a word, set the 'ignorecase' option: >

	:set ignorecase

If you now search for "word", it will also match "Word" and "WORD".  To match
case again: >

	:set noignorecase


HISTORY

Suppose you do three searches: >

	/one
	/two
	/three

Now let's start searching by typing a simple "/" without pressing <Enter>.  If
you press <Up> (the cursor key), Vim puts "/three" on the command line.
Pressing <Enter> at this point searches for three.  If you do not press
<Enter>, but press <Up> instead, Vim changes the prompt to "/two".  Another
press of <Up> moves you to "/one".
   You can also use the <Down> cursor key to move through the history of
search commands in the other direction.

If you know what a previously used pattern starts with, and you want to use it
again, type that character before pressing <Up>.  With the previous example,
you can type "/o<Up>" and Vim will put "/one" on the command line.

The commands starting with ":" also have a history.  That allows you to recall
a previous command and execute it again.  These two histories are separate.


SEARCHING FOR A WORD IN THE TEXT

Suppose you see the word "TheLongFunctionName" in the text and you want to
find the next occurrence of it.  You could type "/TheLongFunctionName", but
that's a lot of typing.  And when you make a mistake Vim won't find it.
   There is an easier way: Position the cursor on the word and use the "*"
command.  Vim will grab the word under the cursor and use it as the search
string.
   The "#" command does the same in the other direction.  You can prepend a
count: "3*" searches for the third occurrence of the word under the cursor.


SEARCHING FOR WHOLE WORDS

If you type "/the" it will also match "there".  To only find words that end
in "the" use: >

	/the\>

The "\>" item is a special marker that only matches at the end of a word.
Similarly "\<" only matches at the begin of a word.  Thus to search for the
word "the" only: >

	/\<the\>

This does not match "there" or "soothe".  Notice that the "*" and "#" commands
use these start-of-word and end-of-word markers to only find whole words (you
can use "g*" and "g#" to match partial words).


HIGHLIGHTING MATCHES

While editing a program you see a variable called "nr".  You want to check
where it's used.  You could move the cursor to "nr" and use the "*" command
and press "n" to go along all the matches.
   There is another way.  Type this command: >

	:set hlsearch

If you now search for "nr", Vim will highlight all matches.  That is a very
good way to see where the variable is used, without the need to type commands.
   To switch this off: >

	:set nohlsearch

Then you need to switch it on again if you want to use it for the next search
command.  If you only want to remove the highlighting, use this command: >

	:nohlsearch

This doesn't reset the option.  Instead, it disables the highlighting.  As
soon as you execute a search command, the highlighting will be used again.
Also for the "n" and "N" commands.


TUNING SEARCHES

There are a few options that change how searching works.  These are the
essential ones:
>
	:set incsearch

This makes Vim display the match for the string while you are still typing it.
Use this to check if the right match will be found.  Then press <Enter> to
really jump to that location.  Or type more to change the search string.
>
	:set nowrapscan

This stops the search at the end of the file.  Or, when you are searching
backwards, at the start of the file.  The 'wrapscan' option is on by default,
thus searching wraps around the end of the file.


INTERMEZZO

If you like one of the options mentioned before, and set it each time you use
Vim, you can put the command in your Vim startup file.
   Edit the file, as mentioned at |not-compatible|.  Or use this command to
find out where it is: >

	:scriptnames

Edit the file, for example with: >

	:edit ~/.vimrc

Then add a line with the command to set the option, just like you typed it in
Vim.  Example: >

	Go:set hlsearch<Esc>

"G" moves to the end of the file.  "o" starts a new line, where you type the
":set" command.  You end insert mode with <Esc>.  Then write the file: >

	ZZ

If you now start Vim again, the 'hlsearch' option will already be set.

==============================================================================
*03.9*	Simple search patterns

The Vim editor uses regular expressions to specify what to search for.
Regular expressions are an extremely powerful and compact way to specify a
search pattern.  Unfortunately, this power comes at a price, because regular
expressions are a bit tricky to specify.
   In this section we mention only a few essential ones.  More about search
patterns and commands in chapter 27 |usr_27.txt|.  You can find the full
explanation here: |pattern|.


BEGINNING AND END OF A LINE

The ^ character matches the beginning of a line.  On an English-US keyboard
you find it above the 6.  The pattern "include" matches the word include
anywhere on the line.  But the pattern "^include" matches the word include
only if it is at the beginning of a line.
   The $ character matches the end of a line.  Therefore, "was$" matches the
word was only if it is at the end of a line.

Let's mark the places where "the" matches in this example line with "x"s:

	the solder holding one of the chips melted and the ~
	xxx			  xxx		       xxx

Using "/the$" we find this match:

	the solder holding one of the chips melted and the ~
						       xxx

And with "/^the" we find this one:
	the solder holding one of the chips melted and the ~
	xxx

You can try searching with "/^the$", it will only match a single line
consisting of "the".  White space does matter here, thus if a line contains a
space after the word, like "the ", the pattern will not match.


MATCHING ANY SINGLE CHARACTER

The . (dot) character matches any existing character.  For example, the
pattern "c.m" matches a string whose first character is a c, whose second
character is anything, and whose the third character is m.  Example:

	We use a computer that became the cummin winter. ~
		 xxx		 xxx	  xxx


MATCHING SPECIAL CHARACTERS

If you really want to match a dot, you must avoid its special meaning by
putting a backslash before it.
   If you search for "ter.", you will find these matches:

	We use a computer that became the cummin winter. ~
		      xxxx			    xxxx

Searching for "ter\." only finds the second match.

==============================================================================
*03.10*	Using marks

When you make a jump to a position with the "G" command, Vim remembers the
position from before this jump.  This position is called a mark.  To go back
where you came from, use this command: >

	``

This ` is a backtick or open single-quote character.
   If you use the same command a second time you will jump back again.  That's
because the ` command is a jump itself, and the position from before this jump
is remembered.

Generally, every time you do a command that can move the cursor further than
within the same line, this is called a jump.  This includes the search
commands "/" and "n" (it doesn't matter how far away the match is).  But not
the character searches with "fx" and "tx" or the word movements "w" and "e".
   Also, "j" and "k" are not considered to be a jump.  Even when you use a
count to make them move the cursor quite a long way away.

The `` command jumps back and forth, between two points.  The CTRL-O command
jumps to older positions (Hint: O for older).  CTRL-I then jumps back to newer
positions (Hint: I is just next to O on the keyboard).  Consider this sequence
of commands: >

	33G
	/^The
	CTRL-O

You first jump to line 33, then search for a line that starts with "The".
Then with CTRL-O you jump back to line 33.  Another CTRL-O takes you back to
where you started.  If you now use CTRL-I you jump to line 33 again.  And
to the match for "The" with another CTRL-I.


	     |	example text   ^	     |
	33G  |	example text   |  CTRL-O     | CTRL-I
	     |	example text   |	     |
	     V	line 33 text   ^	     V
	     |	example text   |	     |
       /^The |	example text   |  CTRL-O     | CTRL-I
	     V	There you are  |	     V
		example text

	Note:
	CTRL-I is the same as <Tab>.

The ":jumps" command gives a list of positions you jumped to.  The entry which
you used last is marked with a ">".


NAMED MARKS							*bookmark*

Vim enables you to place your own marks in the text.  The command "ma" marks
the place under the cursor as mark a.  You can place 26 marks (a through z) in
your text.  You can't see them, it's just a position that Vim remembers.
   To go to a mark, use the command `{mark}, where {mark} is the mark letter.
Thus to move to the a mark:
>
	`a

The command 'mark (single quotation mark, or apostrophe) moves you to the
beginning of the line containing the mark.  This differs from the `mark
command, which moves you to marked column.

The marks can be very useful when working on two related parts in a file.
Suppose you have some text near the start of the file you need to look at,
while working on some text near the end of the file.
   Move to the text at the start and place the s (start) mark there: >

	ms

Then move to the text you want to work on and put the e (end) mark there: >

	me

Now you can move around, and when you want to look at the start of the file,
you use this to jump there: >

	's

Then you can use '' to jump back to where you were, or 'e to jump to the text
you were working on at the end.
   There is nothing special about using s for start and e for end, they are
just easy to remember.

You can use this command to get a list of marks: >

	:marks

You will notice a few special marks.  These include:

	'	The cursor position before doing a jump
	"	The cursor position when last editing the file
	[	Start of the last change
	]	End of the last change

2. Usage						*zip-usage* *zip-manual*

   When one edits a *.zip file, this plugin will handle displaying a
   contents page.  Select a file to edit by moving the cursor atop
   the desired file, then hit the <return> key.  After editing, one may
   also write to the file.  Currently, one may not make a new file in
   zip archives via the plugin.

   OPTIONS

   							*g:zip_nomax*

   If this variable exists and is true, the file window will not be
   automatically maximized when opened.

							*g:zip_shq*
   Different operating systems may use one or more shells to execute
   commands.  Zip will try to guess the correct quoting mechanism to
   allow spaces and whatnot in filenames; however, if it is incorrectly
   guessing the quote to use for your setup, you may use >
	g:zip_shq
<  which by default is a single quote under Unix (') and a double quote
   under Windows (").  If you'd rather have no quotes, simply set
   g:zip_shq to the empty string (let g:zip_shq= "") in your <.vimrc>.

   							*g:zip_unzipcmd*
   Use this option to specify the program which does the duty of "unzip".
   It's used during browsing. By default: >
   	let g:zip_unzipcmd= "unzip"
<
							*g:zip_zipcmd*
   Use this option to specify the program which does the duty of "zip".
   It's used during the writing (updating) of a file already in a zip
   file; by default: >
   	let g:zip_zipcmd= "zip"
<
   PREVENTING LOADING~

   If for some reason you do not wish to use vim to examine zipped files,
   you may put the following two variables into your <.vimrc> to prevent
   the zip plugin from loading: >

	let g:loaded_zipPlugin= 1
	let g:loaded_zip      = 1
<

==============================================================================
3. Additional Extensions					*zip-extension*

   Apparently there are a number of archivers which generate zip files that
   don't use the .zip extension (.jar, .xpi, etc).  To handle such files,
   place a line in your <.vimrc> file: >

	au BufReadCmd *.jar,*.xpi call zip#Browse(expand("<amatch>"))
<
   One can simply extend this line to accommodate additional extensions that
   should be treated as zip files.

4. History							*zip-history* {{{1
   v26 Nov 15, 2012 * (Jason Spiro) provided a lot of new extensions that
		      are synonyms for .zip
   v25 Jun 27, 2011 * using keepj with unzip -Z
		      (consistent with the -p variant)
		    * (Ben Staniford) now uses
			has("win32unix") && executable("cygpath")
		      before converting to cygwin-style paths
   v24 Jun 21, 2010 * (Cédric Bosdonnat) unzip seems to need its filenames
		      fnameescape'd as well as shellquote'd
		    * (Motoya Kurotsu) inserted keepj before 0d to protect
		      jump list
   v17 May 09, 2008 * arno caught a security bug
   v15 Sep 07, 2007 * &shq now used if not the empty string for g:zip_shq
   v14 May 07, 2007 * using b:zipfile instead of w:zipfile to avoid problem
                      when editing alternate file to bring up a zipfile
   v10 May 02, 2006 * now using "redraw then echo" to show messages, instead
                      of "echo and prompt user"
		    * g:zip_shq provided to allow for quoting control for the
		      command being passed via :r! ... commands.
   v8 Apr 10, 2006 * Bram Moolenaar reported that he received an error message
                     due to "Pattern not found: ^.*\%0c"; this was caused by
		     stridx finding a Name... at the beginning of the line;
		     zip.vim tried 4,$s/^.*\%0c//, but that doesn't work.
		     Fixed.
   v7 Mar 22, 2006 * escaped some characters that can cause filename handling
                     problems.
   v6 Dec 21, 2005 * writing to files not in directories caused problems -
                     fixed (pointed out by Christian Robinson)
   v5 Nov 22, 2005 * report option workaround installed
   v3 Oct 18, 2005 * <amatch> used instead of <afile> in autocmds
   v2 Sep 16, 2005 * silenced some commands (avoiding hit-enter prompt)
                   * began testing under Windows; works thus far
		   * filetype detection fixed
      Nov 03, 2005 * handles writing zipfiles across a network using
                     netrw#NetWrite()
   v1 Sep 15, 2005 * Initial release, had browsing, reading, and writing

Help on help files					*helphelp*

1. Help commands		|online-help|
2. Translated help files	|help-translated|
3. Writing help files		|help-writing|

==============================================================================
1. Help commands					*online-help*

			*help* *<Help>* *:h* *:help* *<F1>* *i_<F1>* *i_<Help>*
<Help>		or
:h[elp]			Open a window and display the help file in read-only
			mode.  If there is a help window open already, use
			that one.  Otherwise, if the current window uses the
			full width of the screen or is at least 80 characters
			wide, the help window will appear just above the
			current window.  Otherwise the new window is put at
			the very top.
			The 'helplang' option is used to select a language, if
			the main help file is available in several languages.
			{not in Vi}

						*{subject}* *E149* *E661*
:h[elp] {subject}	Like ":help", additionally jump to the tag {subject}.
			{subject} can include wildcards like "*", "?" and
			"[a-z]":
			   :help z?	jump to help for any "z" command
			   :help z.	jump to the help for "z."
			If there is no full match for the pattern, or there
			are several matches, the "best" match will be used.
			A sophisticated algorithm is used to decide which
			match is better than another one.  These items are
			considered in the computation:
			- A match with same case is much better than a match
			  with different case.
			- A match that starts after a non-alphanumeric
			  character is better than a match in the middle of a
			  word.
			- A match at or near the beginning of the tag is
			  better than a match further on.
			- The more alphanumeric characters match, the better.
			- The shorter the length of the match, the better.

			The 'helplang' option is used to select a language, if
			the {subject} is available in several languages.
			To find a tag in a specific language, append "@ab",
			where "ab" is the two-letter language code.  See
			|help-translated|.

			Note that the longer the {subject} you give, the less
			matches will be found.  You can get an idea how this
			all works by using commandline completion (type CTRL-D
			after ":help subject" |c_CTRL-D|).
			If there are several matches, you can have them listed
			by hitting CTRL-D.  Example: >
				:help cont<Ctrl-D>

<			Instead of typing ":help CTRL-V" to search for help
			for CTRL-V you can type: >
				:help ^V
<			This also works together with other characters, for
			example to find help for CTRL-V in Insert mode: >
				:help i^V
<
			To use a regexp |pattern|, first do ":help" and then
			use ":tag {pattern}" in the help window.  The
			":tnext" command can then be used to jump to other
			matches, "tselect" to list matches and choose one. >
				:help index| :tse z.

<			When there is no argument you will see matches for
			"help", to avoid listing all possible matches (that
			would be very slow).
			The number of matches displayed is limited to 300.

			This command can be followed by '|' and another
			command, but you don't need to escape the '|' inside a
			help command.  So these both work: >
				:help |
				:help k| only
<			Note that a space before the '|' is seen as part of
			the ":help" argument.
			You can also use <LF> or <CR> to separate the help
			command from a following command.  You need to type
			CTRL-V first to insert the <LF> or <CR>.  Example: >
				:help so<C-V><CR>only
<			{not in Vi}

:h[elp]! [subject]	Like ":help", but in non-English help files prefer to
			find a tag in a file with the same language as the
			current file.  See |help-translated|.

						 	*:helpc* *:helpclose*
:helpc[lose]            Close one help window, if there is one.

							*:helpg* *:helpgrep*
:helpg[rep] {pattern}[@xx]
			Search all help text files and make a list of lines
			in which {pattern} matches.  Jumps to the first match.
			The optional [@xx] specifies that only matches in the
			"xx" language are to be found.
			You can navigate through the matches with the
			|quickfix| commands, e.g., |:cnext| to jump to the
			next one.  Or use |:cwindow| to get the list of
			matches in the quickfix window.
			{pattern} is used as a Vim regexp |pattern|.
			'ignorecase' is not used, add "\c" to ignore case.
			Example for case sensitive search: >
				:helpgrep Uganda
<			Example for case ignoring search: >
				:helpgrep uganda\c
<			Example for searching in French help: >
				:helpgrep backspace@fr
<			The pattern does not support line breaks, it must
			match within one line.  You can use |:grep| instead,
			but then you need to get the list of help files in a
			complicated way.
			Cannot be followed by another command, everything is
			used as part of the pattern.  But you can use
			|:execute| when needed.
			Compressed help files will not be searched (Fedora
			compresses the help files).
			{not in Vi}

							*:lh* *:lhelpgrep*
:lh[elpgrep] {pattern}[@xx]
			Same as ":helpgrep", except the location list is used
			instead of the quickfix list.  If the help window is
			already opened, then the location list for that window
			is used.  Otherwise, a new help window is opened and
			the location list for that window is set.  The
			location list for the current window is not changed.

							*:exu* *:exusage*
:exu[sage]		Show help on Ex commands.  Added to simulate the Nvi
			command. {not in Vi}

							*:viu* *:viusage*
:viu[sage]		Show help on Normal mode commands.  Added to simulate
			the Nvi command. {not in Vi}

When no argument is given to |:help| the file given with the 'helpfile' option
will be opened.  Otherwise the specified tag is searched for in all "doc/tags"
files in the directories specified in the 'runtimepath' option.

The initial height of the help window can be set with the 'helpheight' option
(default 20).

Jump to specific subjects by using tags.  This can be done in two ways:
- Use the "CTRL-]" command while standing on the name of a command or option.
  This only works when the tag is a keyword.  "<C-Leftmouse>" and
  "g<LeftMouse>" work just like "CTRL-]".
- use the ":ta {subject}" command.  This also works with non-keyword
  characters.

Use CTRL-T or CTRL-O to jump back.
Use ":q" to close the help window.

If there are several matches for an item you are looking for, this is how you
can jump to each one of them:
1. Open a help window
2. Use the ":tag" command with a slash prepended to the tag.  E.g.: >
	:tag /min
3. Use ":tnext" to jump to the next matching tag.

It is possible to add help files for plugins and other items.  You don't need
to change the distributed help files for that.  See |add-local-help|.

To write a local help file, see |write-local-help|.

Note that the title lines from the local help files are automagically added to
the "LOCAL ADDITIONS" section in the "help.txt" help file |local-additions|.
This is done when viewing the file in Vim, the file itself is not changed.  It
is done by going through all help files and obtaining the first line of each
file.  The files in $VIMRUNTIME/doc are skipped.

							*help-xterm-window*
If you want to have the help in another xterm window, you could use this
command: >
	:!xterm -e vim +help &
<

			*:helpfind* *:helpf*
:helpf[ind]		Like |:help|, but use a dialog to enter the argument.
			Only for backwards compatibility.  It now executes the
			ToolBar.FindHelp menu entry instead of using a builtin
			dialog.  {only when compiled with |+GUI_GTK|}
			{not in Vi}

					*:helpt* *:helptags*
				*E154* *E150* *E151* *E152* *E153* *E670*
:helpt[ags] [++t] {dir}
			Generate the help tags file(s) for directory {dir}.
			All "*.txt" and "*.??x" files in the directory and
			sub-directories are scanned for a help tag definition
			in between stars.  The "*.??x" files are for
			translated docs, they generate the "tags-??" file, see
			|help-translated|.  The generated tags files are
			sorted.
			When there are duplicates an error message is given.
			An existing tags file is silently overwritten.
			The optional "++t" argument forces adding the
			"help-tags" tag.  This is also done when the {dir} is
			equal to $VIMRUNTIME/doc.
			To rebuild the help tags in the runtime directory
			(requires write permission there): >
				:helptags $VIMRUNTIME/doc
<			{not in Vi}


==============================================================================
2. Translated help files				*help-translated*

It is possible to add translated help files, next to the original English help
files.  Vim will search for all help in "doc" directories in 'runtimepath'.
This is only available when compiled with the |+multi_lang| feature.

At this moment translations are available for:
	Chinese  - multiple authors
	French   - translated by David Blanchet
	Italian  - translated by Antonio Colombo
	Japanese - multiple authors
	Polish   - translated by Mikolaj Machowski
	Russian  - translated by Vassily Ragosin
See the Vim website to find them: http://www.vim.org/translations.php

A set of translated help files consists of these files:

	help.abx
	howto.abx
	...
	tags-ab

"ab" is the two-letter language code.  Thus for Italian the names are:

	help.itx
	howto.itx
	...
	tags-it

The 'helplang' option can be set to the preferred language(s).  The default is
set according to the environment.  Vim will first try to find a matching tag
in the preferred language(s).  English is used when it cannot be found.

To find a tag in a specific language, append "@ab" to a tag, where "ab" is the
two-letter language code.  Example: >
	:he user-manual@it
	:he user-manual@en
The first one finds the Italian user manual, even when 'helplang' is empty.
The second one finds the English user manual, even when 'helplang' is set to
"it".

When using command-line completion for the ":help" command, the "@en"
extension is only shown when a tag exists for multiple languages.  When the
tag only exists for English "@en" is omitted.

When using |CTRL-]| or ":help!" in a non-English help file Vim will try to
find the tag in the same language.  If not found then 'helplang' will be used
to select a language.

Help files must use latin1 or utf-8 encoding.  Vim assumes the encoding is
utf-8 when finding non-ASCII characters in the first line.  Thus you must
translate the header with "For Vim version".

The same encoding must be used for the help files of one language in one
directory.  You can use a different encoding for different languages and use
a different encoding for help files of the same language but in a different
directory.

Hints for translators:
- Do not translate the tags.  This makes it possible to use 'helplang' to
  specify the preferred language.  You may add new tags in your language.
- When you do not translate a part of a file, add tags to the English version,
  using the "tag@en" notation.
- Make a package with all the files and the tags file available for download.
  Users can drop it in one of the "doc" directories and start use it.
  Report this to Bram, so that he can add a link on www.vim.org.
- Use the |:helptags| command to generate the tags files.  It will find all
  languages in the specified directory.

==============================================================================
3. Writing help files					*help-writing*

For ease of use, a Vim help file for a plugin should follow the format of the
standard Vim help files.  If you are writing a new help file it's best to copy
one of the existing files and use it as a template.

The first line in a help file should have the following format:

*helpfile_name.txt*	For Vim version 7.3	Last change: 2010 June 4

The first field is a link to the help file name.  The second field describes
the applicable Vim version.  The last field specifies the last modification
date of the file.  Each field is separated by a tab.

At the bottom of the help file, place a Vim modeline to set the 'textwidth'
and 'tabstop' options and the 'filetype' to 'help'.  Never set a global option
in such a modeline, that can have consequences undesired by whoever reads that
help.


TAGS

To define a help tag, place the name between asterisks (*tag-name*).  The
tag-name should be different from all the Vim help tag names and ideally
should begin with the name of the Vim plugin.  The tag name is usually right
aligned on a line.

When referring to an existing help tag and to create a hot-link, place the
name between two bars (|) eg. |help-writing|.

When referring to a Vim option in the help file, place the option name between
two single quotes, eg. 'statusline'


HIGHLIGHTING

To define a column heading, use a tilde character at the end of the line.
This will highlight the column heading in a different color.  E.g.

Column heading~

To separate sections in a help file, place a series of '=' characters in a
line starting from the first column.  The section separator line is highlighted
differently.

To quote a block of ex-commands verbatim, place a greater than (>) character
at the end of the line before the block and a less than (<) character as the
first non-blank on a line following the block.  Any line starting in column 1
also implicitly stops the block of ex-commands before it.  E.g. >
    function Example_Func()
	echo "Example"
    endfunction
<

The following are highlighted differently in a Vim help file:
  - a special key name expressed either in <> notation as in <PageDown>, or
    as a Ctrl character as in CTRL-X
  - anything between {braces}, e.g. {lhs} and {rhs}

The word "Note", "Notes" and similar automagically receive distinctive
highlighting.  So do these:
	*Todo	something to do
	*Error	something wrong

   The various forms of classef (inherits nothing, inherits once, inherints
   many) don't parse the same in the CST so we look at ALL classes for
   a __metaclass__ and if we find one normalize the inherits to all be
   an arglist.

   For one-liner classes ('class X: pass') there is no indent/dedent so
   we normalize those into having a suite.

   Moving the __metaclass__ into the classdef can also cause the class
   body to be empty so there is some special casing for that as well.

   This fixer also tries very hard to keep original indenting and spacing
   in all those corner cases.

These are a bit arcane because they are derived from the data
structures used by Python's 'pgen' parser generator.

There's also a table here mapping operators to their names in the
token module; the Python tokenize module reports all operators as the
fallback token code OP, but the parser needs the actual token code.

    Once initialized, this class supplies the grammar tables for the
    parsing engine implemented by parse.py.  The parsing engine
    accesses the instance variables directly.  The class here does not
    provide initialization of the tables; several subclasses exist to
    do this (see the conv and pgen modules).

    The load() method reads the tables from a pickle file, which is
    much faster than the other ways offered by subclasses.  The pickle
    file is written by calling dump() (after loading the grammar
    tables using a subclass).  The report() method prints a readable
    representation of the tables to stdout, for debugging.

    The instance variables are as follows:

    symbol2number -- a dict mapping symbol names to numbers.  Symbol
                     numbers are always 256 or higher, to distinguish
                     them from token numbers, which are between 0 and
                     255 (inclusive).

    number2symbol -- a dict mapping numbers to symbol names;
                     these two are each other's inverse.

    states        -- a list of DFAs, where each DFA is a list of
                     states, each state is a list of arcs, and each
                     arc is a (i, j) pair where i is a label and j is
                     a state number.  The DFA number is the index into
                     this list.  (This name is slightly confusing.)
                     Final states are represented by a special arc of
                     the form (0, j) where j is its own state number.

    dfas          -- a dict mapping symbol numbers to (DFA, first)
                     pairs, where DFA is an item from the states list
                     above, and first is a set of tokens that can
                     begin this grammar rule (represented by a dict
                     whose values are always 1).

    labels        -- a list of (x, y) pairs where x is either a token
                     number or a symbol number, and y is either None
                     or a string; the strings are keywords.  The label
                     number is the index in this list; label numbers
                     are used to mark state transitions (arcs) in the
                     DFAs.

    start         -- the number of the grammar's start symbol.

    keywords      -- a dict mapping keyword strings to arc labels.

    tokens        -- a dict mapping token numbers to arc labels.

    The proper usage sequence is:

    p = Parser(grammar, [converter])  # create instance
    p.setup([start])                  # prepare for parsing
    <for each input token>:
        if p.addtoken(...):           # parse a token; may raise ParseError
            break
    root = p.rootnode                 # root of abstract syntax tree

    A Parser instance may be reused by calling setup() repeatedly.

    A Parser instance contains state pertaining to the current token
    sequence, and should not be used concurrently by different threads
    to parse separate token sequences.

    See driver.py for how to get input tokens by tokenizing a file or
    string.

    Parsing is complete when addtoken() returns True; the root of the
    abstract syntax tree can then be retrieved from the rootnode
    instance variable.  When a syntax error occurs, addtoken() raises
    the ParseError exception.  There is no error recovery; the parser
    cannot be used after a syntax error was reported (but it can be
    reinitialized by calling setup()).

        The grammar argument is a grammar.Grammar instance; see the
        grammar module for more information.

        The parser is not ready yet for parsing; you must call the
        setup() method to get it started.

        The optional convert argument is a function mapping concrete
        syntax tree nodes to abstract syntax tree nodes.  If not
        given, no conversion is done and the syntax tree produced is
        the concrete syntax tree.  If given, it must be a function of
        two arguments, the first being the grammar (a grammar.Grammar
        instance), and the second being the concrete syntax tree node
        to be converted.  The syntax tree is converted from the bottom
        up.

        A concrete syntax tree node is a (type, value, context, nodes)
        tuple, where type is the node type (a token or symbol number),
        value is None for symbols and a string for tokens, context is
        None or an opaque value used for error reporting (typically a
        (lineno, offset) pair), and nodes is a list of children for
        symbols, and None for tokens.

        An abstract syntax tree node may be anything; this is entirely
        up to the converter function.

        This *must* be called before starting to parse.

        The optional argument is an alternative start symbol; it
        defaults to the grammar's start symbol.

        You can use a Parser instance to parse any number of programs;
        each time you call setup() the parser is reset to an initial
        state determined by the (implicit or explicit) start symbol.

  Usage: %s [OPTION]... [FILE]...
  or:  %s [OPTION]... --files0-from=F
  Print newline, word, and byte counts for each FILE, and a total line if
more than one FILE is specified.  With no FILE, or when FILE is -,
read standard input.  A word is a non-zero-length sequence of characters
delimited by white space.
The options below may be used to select which counts are printed, always in
the following order: newline, word, character, byte, maximum line length.
  -c, --bytes            print the byte counts
  -m, --chars            print the character counts
  -l, --lines            print the newline counts
         --files0-from=F    read input from the files specified by
                           NUL-terminated names in file F;
                           If F is - then read names from standard input
  -L, --max-line-length  print the length of the longest line
  -w, --words            print the word counts
