ure. 
The variable C<$DeflateError> will contain an error message on failure.

If you are running Perl 5.005 or better the object, C<$z>, returned from 
IO::Compress::Deflate can be used exactly like an L<IO::File|IO::File> filehandle. 
This means that all normal output file operations can be carried out 
with C<$z>. 
For example, to write to a compressed file/buffer you can use either of 
these forms

    $z->print("hello world\n");
    print $z "hello world\n";

The mandatory parameter C<$output> is used to control the destination
of the compressed data. This parameter can take one of these forms.

=over 5

=item A filename

If the C<$output> parameter is a simple scalar, it is assumed to be a
filename. This file will be opened for writing and the compressed data
will be written to it.

=item A filehandle

If the C<$output> parameter is a filehandle, the compressed data will be
written to it.
The string '-' can be used as an alias for standard output.

=item A scalar reference 

If C<$output> is a scalar reference, the compressed data will be stored
in C<$$output>.

=back

If the C<$output> parameter is any other type, C<IO::Compress::Deflate>::new will
return undef.

=head2 Constructor Options

C<OPTS> is any combination of the following options:

=over 5

=item C<< AutoClose => 0|1 >>

This option is only valid when the C<$output> parameter is a filehandle. If
specified, and the value is true, it will result in the C<$output> being
closed once either the C<close> method is called or the C<IO::Compress::Deflate>
object is destroyed.

This parameter defaults to 0.

=item C<< Append => 0|1 >>

Opens C<$output> in append mode. 

The behaviour of this option is dependent on the type of C<$output>.

=over 5

=item * A Buffer

If C<$output> is a buffer and C<Append> is enabled, all compressed data
will be append to the end of C<$output>. Otherwise C<$output> will be
cleared before any data is written to it.

=item * A Filename

If C<$output> is a filename and C<Append> is enabled, the file will be
opened in append mode. Otherwise the contents of the file, if any, will be
truncated before any compressed data is written to it.

=item * A Filehandle

If C<$output> is a filehandle, the file pointer will be positioned to the
end of the file via a call to C<seek> before any compressed data is written
to it.  Otherwise the file pointer will not be moved.

=back

This parameter defaults to 0.

=item C<< Merge => 0|1 >>

This option is used to compress input data and append it to an existing
compressed data stream in C<$output>. The end result is a single compressed
data stream stored in C<$output>. 

It is a fatal error to attempt to use this option when C<$output> is not an
RFC 1950 data stream.

There are a number of other limitations with the C<Merge> option:

=over 5 

=item 1

This module needs to have been built with zlib 1.2.1 or better to work. A
fatal error will be thrown if C<Merge> is used with an older version of
zlib.  

=item 2

If C<$output> is a file or a filehandle, it must be seekable.

=back

This parameter defaults to 0.

=item -Level 

Defines the compression level used by zlib. The value should either be
a number between 0 and 9 (0 means no compression and 9 is maximum
compression), or one of the symbolic constants defined below.

   Z_NO_COMPRESSION
   Z_BEST_SPEED
   Z_BEST_COMPRESSION
   Z_DEFAULT_COMPRESSION

The default is Z_DEFAULT_COMPRESSION.

Note, these constants are not imported by C<IO::Compress::Deflate> by default.

    use IO::Compress::Deflate qw(:strategy);
    use IO::Compress::Deflate qw(:constants);
    use IO::Compress::Deflate qw(:all);

=item -Strategy 

Defines the strategy used to tune the compression. Use one of the symbolic
constants defined below.

   Z_FILTERED
   Z_HUFFMAN_ONLY
   Z_RLE
   Z_FIXED
   Z_DEFAULT_STRATEGY

The default is Z_DEFAULT_STRATEGY.

=item C<< Strict => 0|1 >>

This is a placeholder option.

=back

=head2 Examples

TODO

=head1 Methods 

=head2 print

Usage is

    $z->print($data)
    print $z $data

Compresses and outputs the contents of the C<$data> parameter. This
has the same behaviour as the C<print> built-in.

Returns true if successful.

=head2 printf

Usage is

    $z->printf($format, $data)
    printf $z $format, $data

Compresses and outputs the contents of the C<$data> parameter.

Returns true if successful.

=head2 syswrite

Usage is

    $z->syswrite $data
    $z->syswrite $data, $length
    $z->syswrite $data, $length, $offset

Compresses and outputs the contents of the C<$data> parameter.

Returns the number of uncompressed bytes written, or C<undef> if
unsuccessful.

=head2 write

Usage is

    $z->write $data
    $z->write $data, $length
    $z->write $data, $length, $offset

Compresses and outputs the contents of the C<$data> parameter.

Returns the number of uncompressed bytes written, or C<undef> if
unsuccessful.

=head2 flush

Usage is

    $z->flush;
    $z->flush($flush_type);

Flushes any pending compressed data to the output file/buffer.

This method takes an optional parameter, C<$flush_type>, that controls
how the flushing will be carried out. By default the C<$flush_type>
used is C<Z_FINISH>. Other valid values for C<$flush_type> are
C<Z_NO_FLUSH>, C<Z_SYNC_FLUSH>, C<Z_FULL_FLUSH> and C<Z_BLOCK>. It is
strongly recommended that you only set the C<flush_type> parameter if
you fully understand the implications of what it does - overuse of C<flush>
can seriously degrade the level of compression achieved. See the C<zlib>
documentation for details.

Returns true on success.

=head2 tell

Usage is

    $z->tell()
    tell $z

Returns the uncompressed file offset.

=head2 eof

Usage is

    $z->eof();
    eof($z);

Returns true if the C<close> method has been called.

=head2 seek

    $z->seek($position, $whence);
    seek($z, $position, $whence);

Provides a sub-set of the C<seek> functionality, with the restriction
that it is only legal to seek forward in the output file/buffer.
It is a fatal error to attempt to seek backward.

Empty parts of the file/buffer will have NULL (0x00) bytes written to them.

The C<$whence> parameter takes one the usual values, namely SEEK_SET,
SEEK_CUR or SEEK_END.

Returns 1 on success, 0 on failure.

=head2 binmode

Usage is

    $z->binmode
    binmode $z ;

This is a noop provided for completeness.

=head2 opened

    $z->opened()

Returns true if the object currently refers to a opened file/buffer. 

=head2 autoflush

    my $prev = $z->autoflush()
    my $prev = $z->autoflush(EXPR)

If the C<$z> object is associated with a file or a filehandle, this method
returns the current autoflush setting for the underlying filehandle. If
C<EXPR> is present, and is non-zero, it will enable flushing after every
write/print operation.

If C<$z> is associated with a buffer, this method has no effect and always
returns C<undef>.

B<Note> that the special variable C<$|> B<cannot> be used to set or
retrieve the autoflush setting.

=head2 input_line_number

    $z->input_line_number()
    $z->input_line_number(EXPR)

This method always returns C<undef> when compressing. 

=head2 fileno

    $z->fileno()
    fileno($z)

If the C<$z> object is associated with a file or a filehandle, C<fileno>
will return the underlying file descriptor. Once the C<close> method is
called C<fileno> will return C<undef>.

If the C<$z> object is associated with a buffer, this method will return
C<undef>.

=head2 close

    $z->close() ;
    close $z ;

Flushes any pending compressed data and then closes the output file/buffer. 

For most versions of Perl this method will be automatically invoked if
the IO::Compress::Deflate object is destroyed (either explicitly or by the
variable with the reference to the object going out of scope). The
exceptions are Perl versions 5.005 through 5.00504 and 5.8.0. In
these cases, the C<close> method will be called automatically, but
not until global destruction of all live objects when the program is
terminating.

Therefore, if you want your scripts to be able to run on all versions
of Perl, you should call C<close> explicitly and not rely on automatic
closing.

Returns true on success, otherwise 0.

If the C<AutoClose> option has been enabled when the IO::Compress::Deflate
object was created, and the object is associated with a file, the
underlying file will also be closed.

=head2 newStream([OPTS])

Usage is

    $z->newStream( [OPTS] )

Closes the current compressed data stream and starts a new one.

OPTS consists of any of the options that are available when creating
the C<$z> object.

See the L</"Constructor Options"> section for more details.

=head2 deflateParams

Usage is

    $z->deflateParams

TODO

=head1 Importing 

A number of symbolic constants are required by some methods in 
C<IO::Compress::Deflate>. None are imported by default.

=over 5

=item :all

Imports C<deflate>, C<$DeflateError> and all symbolic
constants that can be used by C<IO::Compress::Deflate>. Same as doing this

    use IO::Compress::Deflate qw(deflate $DeflateError :constants) ;

=item :constants

Import all symbolic constants. Same as doing this

    use IO::Compress::Deflate qw(:flush :level :strategy) ;

=item :flush

These symbolic constants are used by the C<flush> method.

    Z_NO_FLUSH
    Z_PARTIAL_FLUSH
    Z_SYNC_FLUSH
    Z_FULL_FLUSH
    Z_FINISH
    Z_BLOCK

=item :level

These symbolic constants are used by the C<Level> option in the constructor.

    Z_NO_COMPRESSION
    Z_BEST_SPEED
    Z_BEST_COMPRESSION
    Z_DEFAULT_COMPRESSION

=item :strategy

These symbolic constants are used by the C<Strategy> option in the constructor.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module provides a Perl interface that allows writing bzip2 
compressed data to files or buffer.

For reading bzip2 files/buffers, see the companion module 
L<IO::Uncompress::Bunzip2|IO::Uncompress::Bunzip2>.

=head1 Functional Interface

A top-level function, C<bzip2>, is provided to carry out
"one-shot" compression between buffers and/or files. For finer
control over the compression process, see the L</"OO Interface">
section.

    use IO::Compress::Bzip2 qw(bzip2 $Bzip2Error) ;

    bzip2 $input_filename_or_reference => $output_filename_or_reference [,OPTS] 
        or die "bzip2 failed: $Bzip2Error\n";

The functional interface needs Perl5.005 or better.

=head2 bzip2 $input_filename_or_reference => $output_filename_or_reference [, OPTS]

C<bzip2> expects at least two parameters,
C<$input_filename_or_reference> and C<$output_filename_or_reference>.

=head3 The C<$input_filename_or_reference> parameter

The parameter, C<$input_filename_or_reference>, is used to define the
source of the uncompressed data. 

It can take one of the following forms:

=over 5

=item A filename

If the <$input_filename_or_reference> parameter is a simple scalar, it is
assumed to be a filename. This file will be opened for reading and the
input data will be read from it.

=item A filehandle

If the C<$input_filename_or_reference> parameter is a filehandle, the input
data will be read from it.  The string '-' can be used as an alias for
standard input.

=item A scalar reference 

If C<$input_filename_or_reference> is a scalar reference, the input data
will be read from C<$$input_filename_or_reference>.

=item An array reference 

If C<$input_filename_or_reference> is an array reference, each element in
the array must be a filename.

The input data will be read from each file in turn. 

The complete array will be walked to ensure that it only
contains valid filenames before any data is compressed.

=item An Input FileGlob string

If C<$input_filename_or_reference> is a string that is delimited by the
characters "<" and ">" C<bzip2> will assume that it is an 
I<input fileglob string>. The input is the list of files that match the 
fileglob.

See L<File::GlobMapper|File::GlobMapper> for more details.

=back

If the C<$input_filename_or_reference> parameter is any other type,
C<undef> will be returned.

=head3 The C<$output_filename_or_reference> parameter

The parameter C<$output_filename_or_reference> is used to control the
destination of the compressed data. This parameter can take one of
these forms.

=over 5

=item A filename

If the C<$output_filename_or_reference> parameter is a simple scalar, it is
assumed to be a filename.  This file will be opened for writing and the 
compressed data will be written to it.

=item A filehandle

If the C<$output_filename_or_reference> parameter is a filehandle, the
compressed data will be written to it.  The string '-' can be used as
an alias for standard output.

=item A scalar reference 

If C<$output_filename_or_reference> is a scalar reference, the
compressed data will be stored in C<$$output_filename_or_reference>.

=item An Array Reference

If C<$output_filename_or_reference> is an array reference, 
the compressed data will be pushed onto the array.

=item An Output FileGlob

If C<$output_filename_or_reference> is a string that is delimited by the
characters "<" and ">" C<bzip2> will assume that it is an
I<output fileglob string>. The output is the list of files that match the
fileglob.

When C<$output_filename_or_reference> is an fileglob string,
C<$input_filename_or_reference> must also be a fileglob string. Anything
else is an error.

See L<File::GlobMapper|File::GlobMapper> for more details.

=back

If the C<$output_filename_or_reference> parameter is any other type,
C<undef> will be returned.

=head2 Notes

When C<$input_filename_or_reference> maps to multiple files/buffers and
C<$output_filename_or_reference> is a single
file/buffer the input files/buffers will be stored
in C<$output_filename_or_reference> as a concatenated series of compressed data streams.

=head2 Optional Parameters

Unless specified below, the optional parameters for C<bzip2>,
C<OPTS>, are the same as those used with the OO interface defined in the
L</"Constructor Options"> section below.

=over 5

=item C<< AutoClose => 0|1 >>

This option applies to any input or output data streams to 
C<bzip2> that are filehandles.

If C<AutoClose> is specified, and the value is true, it will result in all
input and/or output filehandles being closed once C<bzip2> has
completed.

This parameter defaults to 0.

=item C<< BinModeIn => 0|1 >>

When reading from a file or filehandle, set C<binmode> before reading.

Defaults to 0.

=item C<< Append => 0|1 >>

The behaviour of this option is dependent on the type of output data
stream.

=over 5

=item * A Buffer

If C<Append> is enabled, all compressed data will be append to the end of
the output buffer. Otherwise the output buffer will be cleared before any
compressed data is written to it.

=item * A Filename

If C<Append> is enabled, the file will be opened in append mode. Otherwise
the contents of the file, if any, will be truncated before any compressed
data is written to it.

=item * A Filehandle

If C<Append> is enabled, the filehandle will be positioned to the end of
the file via a call to C<seek> before any compressed data is
written to it.  Otherwise the file pointer will not be moved.

=back

When C<Append> is specified, and set to true, it will I<append> all compressed 
data to the output data stream.

So when the output is a filehandle it will carry out a seek to the eof
before writing any compressed data. If the output is a filename, it will be opened for
appending. If the output is a buffer, all compressed data will be
appended to the existing buffer.

Conversely when C<Append> is not specified, or it is present and is set to
false, it will operate as follows.

When the output is a filename, it will truncate the contents of the file
before writing any compressed data. If the output is a filehandle
its position will not be changed. If the output is a buffer, it will be
wiped before any compressed data is output.

Defaults to 0.

=back

=head2 Examples

To read the contents of the file C<file1.txt> and write the compressed
data to the file C<file1.txt.bz2>.

    use strict ;
    use warnings ;
    use IO::Compress::Bzip2 qw(bzip2 $Bzip2Error) ;

    my $input = "file1.txt";
    bzip2 $input => "$input.bz2"
        or die "bzip2 failed: $Bzip2Error\n";

To read from an existing Perl filehandle, C<$input>, and write the
compressed data to a buffer, C<$buffer>.

    use strict ;
    use warnings ;
    use IO::Compress::Bzip2 qw(bzip2 $Bzip2Error) ;
    use IO::File ;

    my $input = new IO::File "<file1.txt"
        or die "Cannot open 'file1.txt': $!\n" ;
    my $buffer ;
    bzip2 $input => \$buffer 
        or die "bzip2 failed: $Bzip2Error\n";

To compress all files in the directory "/my/home" that match "*.txt"
and store the compressed data in the same directory

    use strict ;
    use warnings ;
    use IO::Compress::Bzip2 qw(bzip2 $Bzip2Error) ;

    bzip2 '</my/home/*.txt>' => '<*.bz2>'
        or die "bzip2 failed: $Bzip2Error\n";

and if you want to compress each file one at a time, this will do the trick

    use strict ;
    use warnings ;
    use IO::Compress::Bzip2 qw(bzip2 $Bzip2Error) ;

    for my $input ( glob "/my/home/*.txt" )
    {
        my $output = "$input.bz2" ;
        bzip2 $input => $output 
            or die "Error compressing '$input': $Bzip2Error\n";
    }

=head1 OO Interface

=head2 Constructor

The format of the constructor for C<IO::Compress::Bzip2> is shown below

    my $z = new IO::Compress::Bzip2 $output [,OPTS]
        or die "IO::Compress::Bzip2 failed: $Bzip2Error\n";

It returns an C<IO::Compress::Bzip2> object on success and undef on failure. 
The variable C<$Bzip2Error> will contain an error message on failure.

If you are running Perl 5.005 or better the object, C<$z>, returned from 
IO::Compress::Bzip2 can be used exactly like an L<IO::File|IO::File> filehandle. 
This means that all normal output file operations can be carried out 
with C<$z>. 
For example, to write to a compressed file/buffer you can use either of 
these forms

    $z->print("hello world\n");
    print $z "hello world\n";

The mandatory parameter C<$output> is used to control the destination
of the compressed data. This parameter can take one of these forms.

=over 5

=item A filename

If the C<$output> parameter is a simple scalar, it is assumed to be a
filename. This file will be opened for writing and the compressed data
will be written to it.

=item A filehandle

If the C<$output> parameter is a filehandle, the compressed data will be
written to it.
The string '-' can be used as an alias for standard output.

=item A scalar reference 

If C<$output> is a scalar reference, the compressed data will be stored
in C<$$output>.

=back

If the C<$output> parameter is any other type, C<IO::Compress::Bzip2>::new will
return undef.

=head2 Constructor Options

C<OPTS> is any combination of the following options:

=over 5

=item C<< AutoClose => 0|1 >>

This option is only valid when the C<$output> parameter is a filehandle. If
specified, and the value is true, it will result in the C<$output> being
closed once either the C<close> method is called or the C<IO::Compress::Bzip2>
object is destroyed.

This parameter defaults to 0.

=item C<< Append => 0|1 >>

Opens C<$output> in append mode. 

The behaviour of this option is dependent on the type of C<$output>.

=over 5

=item * A Buffer

If C<$output> is a buffer and C<Append> is enabled, all compressed data
will be append to the end of C<$output>. Otherwise C<$output> will be
cleared before any data is written to it.

=item * A Filename

If C<$output> is a filename and C<Append> is enabled, the file will be
opened in append mode. Otherwise the contents of the file, if any, will be
truncated before any compressed data is written to it.

=item * A Filehandle

If C<$output> is a filehandle, the file pointer will be positioned to the
end of the file via a call to C<seek> before any compressed data is written
to it.  Otherwise the file pointer will not be moved.

=back

This parameter defaults to 0.

=item C<< BlockSize100K => number >>

Specify the number of 100K blocks bzip2 uses during compression. 

Valid values are from 1 to 9, where 9 is best compression.

The default is 1.

=item C<< WorkFactor => number >>

Specifies how much effort bzip2 should take before resorting to a slower
fallback compression algorithm.

Valid values range from 0 to 250, where 0 means use the default value 30.

The default is 0.

=item C<< Strict => 0|1 >>

This is a placeholder option.

=back

=head2 Examples

TODO

=head1 Methods 

=head2 print

Usage is

    $z->print($data)
    print $z $data

Compresses and outputs the contents of the C<$data> parameter. This
has the same behaviour as the C<print> built-in.

Returns true if successful.

=head2 printf

Usage is

    $z->printf($format, $data)
    printf $z $format, $data

Compresses and outputs the contents of the C<$data> parameter.

Returns true if successful.

=head2 syswrite

Usage is

    $z->syswrite $data
    $z->syswrite $data, $length
    $z->syswrite $data, $length, $offset

Compresses and outputs the contents of the C<$data> parameter.

Returns the number of uncompressed bytes written, or C<undef> if
unsuccessful.

=head2 write

Usage is

    $z->write $data
    $z->write $data, $length
    $z->write $data, $length, $offset

Compresses and outputs the contents of the C<$data> parameter.

Returns the number of uncompressed bytes written, or C<undef> if
unsuccessful.

=head2 flush

Usage is

    $z->flush;

Flushes any pending compressed data to the output file/buffer.

TODO

Returns true on success.

=head2 tell

Usage is

    $z->tell()
    tell $z

Returns the uncompressed file offset.

=head2 eof

Usage is

    $z->eof();
    eof($z);

Returns true if the C<close> method has been called.

=head2 seek

    $z->seek($position, $whence);
    seek($z, $position, $whence);

Provides a sub-set of the C<seek> functionality, with the restriction
that it is only legal to seek forward in the output file/buffer.
It is a fatal error to attempt to seek backward.

Empty parts of the file/buffer will have NULL (0x00) bytes written to them.

The C<$whence> parameter takes one the usual values, namely SEEK_SET,
SEEK_CUR or SEEK_END.

Returns 1 on success, 0 on failure.

=head2 binmode

Usage is

    $z->binmode
    binmode $z ;

This is a noop provided for completeness.

=head2 opened

    $z->opened()

Returns true if the object currently refers to a opened file/buffer. 

=head2 autoflush

    my $prev = $z->autoflush()
    my $prev = $z->autoflush(EXPR)

If the C<$z> object is associated with a file or a filehandle, this method
returns the current autoflush setting for the underlying filehandle. If
C<EXPR> is present, and is non-zero, it will enable flushing after every
write/print operation.

If C<$z> is associated with a buffer, this method has no effect and always
returns C<undef>.

B<Note> that the special variable C<$|> B<cannot> be used to set or
retrieve the autoflush setting.

=head2 input_line_number

    $z->input_line_number()
    $z->input_line_number(EXPR)

This method always returns C<undef> when compressing. 

=head2 fileno

    $z->fileno()
    fileno($z)

If the C<$z> object is associated with a file or a filehandle, C<fileno>
will return the underlying file descriptor. Once the C<close> method is
called C<fileno> will return C<undef>.

If the C<$z> object is associated with a buffer, this method will return
C<undef>.

=head2 close

    $z->close() ;
    close $z ;

Flushes any pending compressed data and then closes the output file/buffer. 

For most versions of Perl this method will be automatically invoked if
the IO::Compress::Bzip2 object is destroyed (either explicitly or by the
variable with the reference to the object going out of scope). The
exceptions are Perl versions 5.005 through 5.00504 and 5.8.0. In
these cases, the C<close> method will be called automatically, but
not until global destruction of all live objects when the program is
terminating.

Therefore, if you want your scripts to be able to run on all versions
of Perl, you should call C<close> explicitly and not rely on automatic
closing.

Returns true on success, otherwise 0.

If the C<AutoClose> option has been enabled when the IO::Compress::Bzip2
object was created, and the object is associated with a file, the
underlying file will also be closed.

=head2 newStream([OPTS])

Usage is

    $z->newStream( [OPTS] )

Closes the current compressed data stream and starts a new one.

OPTS consists of any of the options that are available when creating
the C<$z> object.

See the L</"Constructor Options"> section for more details.

=head1 Importing 

No symbolic constants are required by this IO::Compress::Bzip2 at present. 

=over 5

=item :all

Imports C<bzip2> and C<$Bzip2Error>.
Same as doing this

    use IO::Compress::Bzip2 qw(bzip2 $Bzip2Error) ;

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module provides a Perl interface that allows writing compressed
data to files or buffer as defined in RFC 1951.

Note that RFC 1951 data is not a good choice of compression format
to use in isolation, especially if you want to auto-detect it.

For reading RFC 1951 files/buffers, see the companion module 
L<IO::Uncompress::RawInflate|IO::Uncompress::RawInflate>.

=head1 Functional Interface

A top-level function, C<rawdeflate>, is provided to carry out
"one-shot" compression between buffers and/or files. For finer
control over the compression process, see the L</"OO Interface">
section.

    use IO::Compress::RawDeflate qw(rawdeflate $RawDeflateError) ;

    rawdeflate $input_filename_or_reference => $output_filename_or_reference [,OPTS] 
        or die "rawdeflate failed: $RawDeflateError\n";

The functional interface needs Perl5.005 or better.

=head2 rawdeflate $input_filename_or_reference => $output_filename_or_reference [, OPTS]

C<rawdeflate> expects at least two parameters,
C<$input_filename_or_reference> and C<$output_filename_or_reference>.

=head3 The C<$input_filename_or_reference> parameter

The parameter, C<$input_filename_or_reference>, is used to define the
source of the uncompressed data. 

It can take one of the following forms:

=over 5

=item A filename

If the <$input_filename_or_reference> parameter is a simple scalar, it is
assumed to be a filename. This file will be opened for reading and the
input data will be read from it.

=item A filehandle

If the C<$input_filename_or_reference> parameter is a filehandle, the input
data will be read from it.  The string '-' can be used as an alias for
standard input.

=item A scalar reference 

If C<$input_filename_or_reference> is a scalar reference, the input data
will be read from C<$$input_filename_or_reference>.

=item An array reference 

If C<$input_filename_or_reference> is an array reference, each element in
the array must be a filename.

The input data will be read from each file in turn. 

The complete array will be walked to ensure that it only
contains valid filenames before any data is compressed.

=item An Input FileGlob string

If C<$input_filename_or_reference> is a string that is delimited by the
characters "<" and ">" C<rawdeflate> will assume that it is an 
I<input fileglob string>. The input is the list of files that match the 
fileglob.

See L<File::GlobMapper|File::GlobMapper> for more details.

=back

If the C<$input_filename_or_reference> parameter is any other type,
C<undef> will be returned.

=head3 The C<$output_filename_or_reference> parameter

The parameter C<$output_filename_or_reference> is used to control the
destination of the compressed data. This parameter can take one of
these forms.

=over 5

=item A filename

If the C<$output_filename_or_reference> parameter is a simple scalar, it is
assumed to be a filename.  This file will be opened for writing and the 
compressed data will be written to it.

=item A filehandle

If the C<$output_filename_or_reference> parameter is a filehandle, the
compressed data will be written to it.  The string '-' can be used as
an alias for standard output.

=item A scalar reference 

If C<$output_filename_or_reference> is a scalar reference, the
compressed data will be stored in C<$$output_filename_or_reference>.

=item An Array Reference

If C<$output_filename_or_reference> is an array reference, 
the compressed data will be pushed onto the array.

=item An Output FileGlob

If C<$output_filename_or_reference> is a string that is delimited by the
characters "<" and ">" C<rawdeflate> will assume that it is an
I<output fileglob string>. The output is the list of files that match the
fileglob.

When C<$output_filename_or_reference> is an fileglob string,
C<$input_filename_or_reference> must also be a fileglob string. Anything
else is an error.

See L<File::GlobMapper|File::GlobMapper> for more details.

=back

If the C<$output_filename_or_reference> parameter is any other type,
C<undef> will be returned.

=head2 Notes

When C<$input_filename_or_reference> maps to multiple files/buffers and
C<$output_filename_or_reference> is a single
file/buffer the input files/buffers will be stored
in C<$output_filename_or_reference> as a concatenated series of compressed data streams.

=head2 Optional Parameters

Unless specified below, the optional parameters for C<rawdeflate>,
C<OPTS>, are the same as those used with the OO interface defined in the
L</"Constructor Options"> section below.

=over 5

=item C<< AutoClose => 0|1 >>

This option applies to any input or output data streams to 
C<rawdeflate> that are filehandles.

If C<AutoClose> is specified, and the value is true, it will result in all
input and/or output filehandles being closed once C<rawdeflate> has
completed.

This parameter defaults to 0.

=item C<< BinModeIn => 0|1 >>

When reading from a file or filehandle, set C<binmode> before reading.

Defaults to 0.

=item C<< Append => 0|1 >>

The behaviour of this option is dependent on the type of output data
stream.

=over 5

=item * A Buffer

If C<Append> is enabled, all compressed data will be append to the end of
the output buffer. Otherwise the output buffer will be cleared before any
compressed data is written to it.

=item * A Filename

If C<Append> is enabled, the file will be opened in append mode. Otherwise
the contents of the file, if any, will be truncated before any compressed
data is written to it.

=item * A Filehandle

If C<Append> is enabled, the filehandle will be positioned to the end of
the file via a call to C<seek> before any compressed data is
written to it.  Otherwise the file pointer will not be moved.

=back

When C<Append> is specified, and set to true, it will I<append> all compressed 
data to the output data stream.

So when the output is a filehandle it will carry out a seek to the eof
before writing any compressed data. If the output is a filename, it will be opened for
appending. If the output is a buffer, all compressed data will be
appended to the existing buffer.

Conversely when C<Append> is not specified, or it is present and is set to
false, it will operate as follows.

When the output is a filename, it will truncate the contents of the file
before writing any compressed data. If the output is a filehandle
its position will not be changed. If the output is a buffer, it will be
wiped before any compressed data is output.

Defaults to 0.

=back

=head2 Examples

To read the contents of the file C<file1.txt> and write the compressed
data to the file C<file1.txt.1951>.

    use strict ;
    use warnings ;
    use IO::Compress::RawDeflate qw(rawdeflate $RawDeflateError) ;

    my $input = "file1.txt";
    rawdeflate $input => "$input.1951"
        or die "rawdeflate failed: $RawDeflateError\n";

To read from an existing Perl filehandle, C<$input>, and write the
compressed data to a buffer, C<$buffer>.

    use strict ;
    use warnings ;
    use IO::Compress::RawDeflate qw(rawdeflate $RawDeflateError) ;
    use IO::File ;

    my $input = new IO::File "<file1.txt"
        or die "Cannot open 'file1.txt': $!\n" ;
    my $buffer ;
    rawdeflate $input => \$buffer 
        or die "rawdeflate failed: $RawDeflateError\n";

To compress all files in the directory "/my/home" that match "*.txt"
and store the compressed data in the same directory

    use strict ;
    use warnings ;
    use IO::Compress::RawDeflate qw(rawdeflate $RawDeflateError) ;

    rawdeflate '</my/home/*.txt>' => '<*.1951>'
        or die "rawdeflate failed: $RawDeflateError\n";

and if you want to compress each file one at a time, this will do the trick

    use strict ;
    use warnings ;
    use IO::Compress::RawDeflate qw(rawdeflate $RawDeflateError) ;

    for my $input ( glob "/my/home/*.txt" )
    {
        my $output = "$input.1951" ;
        rawdeflate $input => $output 
            or die "Error compressing '$input': $RawDeflateError\n";
    }

=head1 OO Interface

=head2 Constructor

The format of the constructor for C<IO::Compress::RawDeflate> is shown below

    my $z = new IO::Compress::RawDeflate $output [,OPTS]
        or die "IO::Compress::RawDeflate failed: $RawDeflateError\n";

It returns an C<IO::Compress::RawDeflate> object on success and undef on failure. 
The variable C<$RawDeflateError> will contain an error message on failure.

If you are running Perl 5.005 or better the object, C<$z>, returned from 
IO::Compress::RawDeflate can be used exactly like an L<IO::File|IO::File> filehandle. 
This means that all normal output file operations can be carried out 
with C<$z>. 
For example, to write to a compressed file/buffer you can use either of 
these forms

    $z->print("hello world\n");
    print $z "hello world\n";

The mandatory parameter C<$output> is used to control the destination
of the compressed data. This parameter can take one of these forms.

=over 5

=item A filename

If the C<$output> parameter is a simple scalar, it is assumed to be a
filename. This file will be opened for writing and the compressed data
will be written to it.

=item A filehandle

If the C<$output> parameter is a filehandle, the compressed data will be
written to it.
The string '-' can be used as an alias for standard output.

=item A scalar reference 

If C<$output> is a scalar reference, the compressed data will be stored
in C<$$output>.

=back

If the C<$output> parameter is any other type, C<IO::Compress::RawDeflate>::new will
return undef.

=head2 Constructor Options

C<OPTS> is any combination of the following options:

=over 5

=item C<< AutoClose => 0|1 >>

This option is only valid when the C<$output> parameter is a filehandle. If
specified, and the value is true, it will result in the C<$output> being
closed once either the C<close> method is called or the C<IO::Compress::RawDeflate>
object is destroyed.

This parameter defaults to 0.

=item C<< Append => 0|1 >>

Opens C<$output> in append mode. 

The behaviour of this option is dependent on the type of C<$output>.

=over 5

=item * A Buffer

If C<$output> is a buffer and C<Append> is enabled, all compressed data
will be append to the end of C<$output>. Otherwise C<$output> will be
cleared before any data is written to it.

=item * A Filename

If C<$output> is a filename and C<Append> is enabled, the file will be
opened in append mode. Otherwise the contents of the file, if any, will be
truncated before any compressed data is written to it.

=item * A Filehandle

If C<$output> is a filehandle, the file pointer will be positioned to the
end of the file via a call to C<seek> before any compressed data is written
to it.  Otherwise the file pointer will not be moved.

=back

This parameter defaults to 0.

=item C<< Merge => 0|1 >>

This option is used to compress input data and append it to an existing
compressed data stream in C<$output>. The end result is a single compressed
data stream stored in C<$output>. 

It is a fatal error to attempt to use this option when C<$output> is not an
RFC 1951 data stream.

There are a number of other limitations with the C<Merge> option:

=over 5 

=item 1

This module needs to have been built with zlib 1.2.1 or better to work. A
fatal error will be thrown if C<Merge> is used with an older version of
zlib.  

=item 2

If C<$output> is a file or a filehandle, it must be seekable.

=back

This parameter defaults to 0.

=item -Level 

Defines the compression level used by zlib. The value should either be
a number between 0 and 9 (0 means no compression and 9 is maximum
compression), or one of the symbolic constants defined below.

   Z_NO_COMPRESSION
   Z_BEST_SPEED
   Z_BEST_COMPRESSION
   Z_DEFAULT_COMPRESSION

The default is Z_DEFAULT_COMPRESSION.

Note, these constants are not imported by C<IO::Compress::RawDeflate> by default.

    use IO::Compress::RawDeflate qw(:strategy);
    use IO::Compress::RawDeflate qw(:constants);
    use IO::Compress::RawDeflate qw(:all);

=item -Strategy 

Defines the strategy used to tune the compression. Use one of the symbolic
constants defined below.

   Z_FILTERED
   Z_HUFFMAN_ONLY
   Z_RLE
   Z_FIXED
   Z_DEFAULT_STRATEGY

The default is Z_DEFAULT_STRATEGY.

=item C<< Strict => 0|1 >>

This is a placeholder option.

=back

=head2 Examples

TODO

=head1 Methods 

=head2 print

Usage is

    $z->print($data)
    print $z $data

Compresses and outputs the contents of the C<$data> parameter. This
has the same behaviour as the C<print> built-in.

Returns true if successful.

=head2 printf

Usage is

    $z->printf($format, $data)
    printf $z $format, $data

Compresses and outputs the contents of the C<$data> parameter.

Returns true if successful.

=head2 syswrite

Usage is

    $z->syswrite $data
    $z->syswrite $data, $length
    $z->syswrite $data, $length, $offset

Compresses and outputs the contents of the C<$data> parameter.

Returns the number of uncompressed bytes written, or C<undef> if
unsuccessful.

=head2 write

Usage is

    $z->write $data
    $z->write $data, $length
    $z->write $data, $length, $offset

Compresses and outputs the contents of the C<$data> parameter.

Returns the number of uncompressed bytes written, or C<undef> if
unsuccessful.

=head2 flush

Usage is

    $z->flush;
    $z->flush($flush_type);

Flushes any pending compressed data to the output file/buffer.

This method takes an optional parameter, C<$flush_type>, that controls
how the flushing will be carried out. By default the C<$flush_type>
used is C<Z_FINISH>. Other valid values for C<$flush_type> are
C<Z_NO_FLUSH>, C<Z_SYNC_FLUSH>, C<Z_FULL_FLUSH> and C<Z_BLOCK>. It is
strongly recommended that you only set the C<flush_type> parameter if
you fully understand the implications of what it does - overuse of C<flush>
can seriously degrade the level of compression achieved. See the C<zlib>
documentation for details.

Returns true on success.

=head2 tell

Usage is

    $z->tell()
    tell $z

Returns the uncompressed file offset.

=head2 eof

Usage is

    $z->eof();
    eof($z);

Returns true if the C<close> method has been called.

=head2 seek

    $z->seek($position, $whence);
    seek($z, $position, $whence);

Provides a sub-set of the C<seek> functionality, with the restriction
that it is only legal to seek forward in the output file/buffer.
It is a fatal error to attempt to seek backward.

Empty parts of the file/buffer will have NULL (0x00) bytes written to them.

The C<$whence> parameter takes one the usual values, namely SEEK_SET,
SEEK_CUR or SEEK_END.

Returns 1 on success, 0 on failure.

=head2 binmode

Usage is

    $z->binmode
    binmode $z ;

This is a noop provided for completeness.

=head2 opened

    $z->opened()

Returns true if the object currently refers to a opened file/buffer. 

=head2 autoflush

    my $prev = $z->autoflush()
    my $prev = $z->autoflush(EXPR)

If the C<$z> object is associated with a file or a filehandle, this method
returns the current autoflush setting for the underlying filehandle. If
C<EXPR> is present, and is non-zero, it will enable flushing after every
write/print operation.

If C<$z> is associated with a buffer, this method has no effect and always
returns C<undef>.

B<Note> that the special variable C<$|> B<cannot> be used to set or
retrieve the autoflush setting.

=head2 input_line_number

    $z->input_line_number()
    $z->input_line_number(EXPR)

This method always returns C<undef> when compressing. 

=head2 fileno

    $z->fileno()
    fileno($z)

If the C<$z> object is associated with a file or a filehandle, C<fileno>
will return the underlying file descriptor. Once the C<close> method is
called C<fileno> will return C<undef>.

If the C<$z> object is associated with a buffer, this method will return
C<undef>.

=head2 close

    $z->close() ;
    close $z ;

Flushes any pending compressed data and then closes the output file/buffer. 

For most versions of Perl this method will be automatically invoked if
the IO::Compress::RawDeflate object is destroyed (either explicitly or by the
variable with the reference to the object going out of scope). The
exceptions are Perl versions 5.005 through 5.00504 and 5.8.0. In
these cases, the C<close> method will be called automatically, but
not until global destruction of all live objects when the program is
terminating.

Therefore, if you want your scripts to be able to run on all versions
of Perl, you should call C<close> explicitly and not rely on automatic
closing.

Returns true on success, otherwise 0.

If the C<AutoClose> option has been enabled when the IO::Compress::RawDeflate
object was created, and the object is associated with a file, the
underlying file will also be closed.

=head2 newStream([OPTS])

Usage is

    $z->newStream( [OPTS] )

Closes the current compressed data stream and starts a new one.

OPTS consists of any of the options that are available when creating
the C<$z> object.

See the L</"Constructor Options"> section for more details.

=head2 deflateParams

Usage is

    $z->deflateParams

TODO

=head1 Importing 

A number of symbolic constants are required by some methods in 
C<IO::Compress::RawDeflate>. None are imported by default.

=over 5

=item :all

Imports C<rawdeflate>, C<$RawDeflateError> and all symbolic
constants that can be used by C<IO::Compress::RawDeflate>. Same as doing this

    use IO::Compress::RawDeflate qw(rawdeflate $RawDeflateError :constants) ;

=item :constants

Import all symbolic constants. Same as doing this

    use IO::Compress::RawDeflate qw(:flush :level :strategy) ;

=item :flush

These symbolic constants are used by the C<flush> method.

    Z_NO_FLUSH
    Z_PARTIAL_FLUSH
    Z_SYNC_FLUSH
    Z_FULL_FLUSH
    Z_FINISH
    Z_BLOCK

=item :level

These symbolic constants are used by the C<Level> option in the constructor.

    Z_NO_COMPRESSION
    Z_BEST_SPEED
    Z_BEST_COMPRESSION
    Z_DEFAULT_COMPRESSION

=item :strategy

These symbolic constants are used by the C<Strategy> option in the constructor.

    Z_FILTERED
    Z_HUFFMAN_ONLY
    Z_RLE
    Z_FIXED
    Z_DEFAULT_STRATEGY

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module provides a Perl interface that allows the reading of
files/buffers that conform to RFC 1951.

For writing RFC 1951 files/buffers, see the companion module IO::Compress::RawDeflate.

=head1 Functional Interface

A top-level function, C<rawinflate>, is provided to carry out
"one-shot" uncompression between buffers and/or files. For finer
control over the uncompression process, see the L</"OO Interface">
section.

    use IO::Uncompress::RawInflate qw(rawinflate $RawInflateError) ;

    rawinflate $input_filename_or_reference => $output_filename_or_reference [,OPTS] 
        or die "rawinflate failed: $RawInflateError\n";

The functional interface needs Perl5.005 or better.

=head2 rawinflate $input_filename_or_reference => $output_filename_or_reference [, OPTS]

C<rawinflate> expects at least two parameters,
C<$input_filename_or_reference> and C<$output_filename_or_reference>.

=head3 The C<$input_filename_or_reference> parameter

The parameter, C<$input_filename_or_reference>, is used to define the
source of the compressed data. 

It can take one of the following forms:

=over 5

=item A filename

If the <$input_filename_or_reference> parameter is a simple scalar, it is
assumed to be a filename. This file will be opened for reading and the
input data will be read from it.

=item A filehandle

If the C<$input_filename_or_reference> parameter is a filehandle, the input
data will be read from it.  The string '-' can be used as an alias for
standard input.

=item A scalar reference 

If C<$input_filename_or_reference> is a scalar reference, the input data
will be read from C<$$input_filename_or_reference>.

=item An array reference 

If C<$input_filename_or_reference> is an array reference, each element in
the array must be a filename.

The input data will be read from each file in turn. 

The complete array will be walked to ensure that it only
contains valid filenames before any data is uncompressed.

=item An Input FileGlob string

If C<$input_filename_or_reference> is a string that is delimited by the
characters "<" and ">" C<rawinflate> will assume that it is an 
I<input fileglob string>. The input is the list of files that match the 
fileglob.

See L<File::GlobMapper|File::GlobMapper> for more details.

=back

If the C<$input_filename_or_reference> parameter is any other type,
C<undef> will be returned.

=head3 The C<$output_filename_or_reference> parameter

The parameter C<$output_filename_or_reference> is used to control the
destination of the uncompressed data. This parameter can take one of
these forms.

=over 5

=item A filename

If the C<$output_filename_or_reference> parameter is a simple scalar, it is
assumed to be a filename.  This file will be opened for writing and the 
uncompressed data will be written to it.

=item A filehandle

If the C<$output_filename_or_reference> parameter is a filehandle, the
uncompressed data will be written to it.  The string '-' can be used as
an alias for standard output.

=item A scalar reference 

If C<$output_filename_or_reference> is a scalar reference, the
uncompressed data will be stored in C<$$output_filename_or_reference>.

=item An Array Reference

If C<$output_filename_or_reference> is an array reference, 
the uncompressed data will be pushed onto the array.

=item An Output FileGlob

If C<$output_filename_or_reference> is a string that is delimited by the
characters "<" and ">" C<rawinflate> will assume that it is an
I<output fileglob string>. The output is the list of files that match the
fileglob.

When C<$output_filename_or_reference> is an fileglob string,
C<$input_filename_or_reference> must also be a fileglob string. Anything
else is an error.

See L<File::GlobMapper|File::GlobMapper> for more details.

=back

If the C<$output_filename_or_reference> parameter is any other type,
C<undef> will be returned.

=head2 Notes

When C<$input_filename_or_reference> maps to multiple compressed
files/buffers and C<$output_filename_or_reference> is
a single file/buffer, after uncompression C<$output_filename_or_reference> will contain a
concatenation of all the uncompressed data from each of the input
files/buffers.

=head2 Optional Parameters

Unless specified below, the optional parameters for C<rawinflate>,
C<OPTS>, are the same as those used with the OO interface defined in the
L</"Constructor Options"> section below.

=over 5

=item C<< AutoClose => 0|1 >>

This option applies to any input or output data streams to 
C<rawinflate> that are filehandles.

If C<AutoClose> is specified, and the value is true, it will result in all
input and/or output filehandles being closed once C<rawinflate> has
completed.

This parameter defaults to 0.

=item C<< BinModeOut => 0|1 >>

When writing to a file or filehandle, set C<binmode> before writing to the
file.

Defaults to 0.

=item C<< Append => 0|1 >>

The behaviour of this option is dependent on the type of output data
stream.

=over 5

=item * A Buffer

If C<Append> is enabled, all uncompressed data will be append to the end of
the output buffer. Otherwise the output buffer will be cleared before any
uncompressed data is written to it.

=item * A Filename

If C<Append> is enabled, the file will be opened in append mode. Otherwise
the contents of the file, if any, will be truncated before any uncompressed
data is written to it.

=item * A Filehandle

If C<Append> is enabled, the filehandle will be positioned to the end of
the file via a call to C<seek> before any uncompressed data is
written to it.  Otherwise the file pointer will not be moved.

=back

When C<Append> is specified, and set to true, it will I<append> all uncompressed 
data to the output data stream.

So when the output is a filehandle it will carry out a seek to the eof
before writing any uncompressed data. If the output is a filename, it will be opened for
appending. If the output is a buffer, all uncompressed data will be
appended to the existing buffer.

Conversely when C<Append> is not specified, or it is present and is set to
false, it will operate as follows.

When the output is a filename, it will truncate the contents of the file
before writing any uncompressed data. If the output is a filehandle
its position will not be changed. If the output is a buffer, it will be
wiped before any uncompressed data is output.

Defaults to 0.

=item C<< MultiStream => 0|1 >>

This option is a no-op.

=item C<< TrailingData => $scalar >>

Returns the data, if any, that is present immediately after the compressed
data stream once uncompression is complete. 

This option can be used when there is useful information immediately
following the compressed data stream, and you don't know the length of the
compressed data stream.

If the input is a buffer, C<trailingData> will return everything from the
end of the compressed data stream to the end of the buffer.

If the input is a filehandle, C<trailingData> will return the data that is
left in the filehandle input buffer once the end of the compressed data
stream has been reached. You can then use the filehandle to read the rest
of the input file. 

Don't bother using C<trailingData> if the input is a filename.

If you know the length of the compressed data stream before you start
uncompressing, you can avoid having to use C<trailingData> by setting the
C<InputLength> option.

=back

=head2 Examples

To read the contents of the file C<file1.txt.1951> and write the
uncompressed data to the file C<file1.txt>.

    use strict ;
    use warnings ;
    use IO::Uncompress::RawInflate qw(rawinflate $RawInflateError) ;

    my $input = "file1.txt.1951";
    my $output = "file1.txt";
    rawinflate $input => $output
        or die "rawinflate failed: $RawInflateError\n";

To read from an existing Perl filehandle, C<$input>, and write the
uncompressed data to a buffer, C<$buffer>.

    use strict ;
    use warnings ;
    use IO::Uncompress::RawInflate qw(rawinflate $RawInflateError) ;
    use IO::File ;

    my $input = new IO::File "<file1.txt.1951"
        or die "Cannot open 'file1.txt.1951': $!\n" ;
    my $buffer ;
    rawinflate $input => \$buffer 
        or die "rawinflate failed: $RawInflateError\n";

To uncompress all files in the directory "/my/home" that match "*.txt.1951" and store the compressed data in the same directory

    use strict ;
    use warnings ;
    use IO::Uncompress::RawInflate qw(rawinflate $RawInflateError) ;

    rawinflate '</my/home/*.txt.1951>' => '</my/home/#1.txt>'
        or die "rawinflate failed: $RawInflateError\n";

and if you want to compress each file one at a time, this will do the trick

    use strict ;
    use warnings ;
    use IO::Uncompress::RawInflate qw(rawinflate $RawInflateError) ;

    for my $input ( glob "/my/home/*.txt.1951" )
    {
        my $output = $input;
        $output =~ s/.1951// ;
        rawinflate $input => $output 
            or die "Error compressing '$input': $RawInflateError\n";
    }

=head1 OO Interface

=head2 Constructor

The format of the constructor for IO::Uncompress::RawInflate is shown below

    my $z = new IO::Uncompress::RawInflate $input [OPTS]
        or die "IO::Uncompress::RawInflate failed: $RawInflateError\n";

Returns an C<IO::Uncompress::RawInflate> object on success and undef on failure.
The variable C<$RawInflateError> will contain an error message on failure.

If you are running Perl 5.005 or better the object, C<$z>, returned from
IO::Uncompress::RawInflate can be used exactly like an L<IO::File|IO::File> filehandle.
This means that all normal input file operations can be carried out with
C<$z>.  For example, to read a line from a compressed file/buffer you can
use either of these forms

    $line = $z->getline();
    $line = <$z>;

The mandatory parameter C<$input> is used to determine the source of the
compressed data. This parameter can take one of three forms.

=over 5

=item A filename

If the C<$input> parameter is a scalar, it is assumed to be a filename. This
file will be opened for reading and the compressed data will be read from it.

=item A filehandle

If the C<$input> parameter is a filehandle, the compressed data will be
read from it.
The string '-' can be used as an alias for standard input.

=item A scalar reference 

If C<$input> is a scalar reference, the compressed data will be read from
C<$$input>.

=back

=head2 Constructor Options

The option names defined below are case insensitive and can be optionally
prefixed by a '-'.  So all of the following are valid

    -AutoClose
    -autoclose
    AUTOCLOSE
    autoclose

OPTS is a combination of the following options:

=over 5

=item C<< AutoClose => 0|1 >>

This option is only valid when the C<$input> parameter is a filehandle. If
specified, and the value is true, it will result in the file being closed once
either the C<close> method is called or the IO::Uncompress::RawInflate object is
destroyed.

This parameter defaults to 0.

=item C<< MultiStream => 0|1 >>

Allows multiple concatenated compressed streams to be treated as a single
compressed stream. Decompression will stop once either the end of the
file/buffer is reached, an error is encountered (premature eof, corrupt
compressed data) or the end of a stream is not immediately followed by the
start of another stream.

This parameter defaults to 0.

=item C<< Prime => $string >>

This option will uncompress the contents of C<$string> before processing the
input file/buffer.

This option can be useful when the compressed data is embedded in another
file/data structure and it is not possible to work out where the compressed
data begins without having to read the first few bytes. If this is the
case, the uncompression can be I<primed> with these bytes using this
option.

=item C<< Transparent => 0|1 >>

If this option is set and the input file/buffer is not compressed data,
the module will allow reading of it anyway.

In addition, if the input file/buffer does contain compressed data and
there is non-compressed data immediately following it, setting this option
will make this module treat the whole file/buffer as a single data stream.

This option defaults to 1.

=item C<< BlockSize => $num >>

When reading the compressed input data, IO::Uncompress::RawInflate will read it in
blocks of C<$num> bytes.

This option defaults to 4096.

=item C<< InputLength => $size >>

When present this option will limit the number of compressed bytes read
from the input file/buffer to C<$size>. This option can be used in the
situation where there is useful data directly after the compressed data
stream and you know beforehand the exact length of the compressed data
stream. 

This option is mostly used when reading from a filehandle, in which case
the file pointer will be left pointing to the first byte directly after the
compressed data stream.

This option defaults to off.

=item C<< Append => 0|1 >>

This option controls what the C<read> method does with uncompressed data.

If set to 1, all uncompressed data will be appended to the output parameter
of the C<read> method.

If set to 0, the contents of the output parameter of the C<read> method
will be overwritten by the uncompressed data.

Defaults to 0.

=item C<< Strict => 0|1 >>

This option is a no-op.

=head1 Methods 

=head2 read

Usage is

    $status = $z->read($buffer)

Reads a block of compressed data (the size of the compressed block is
determined by the C<Buffer> option in the constructor), uncompresses it and
writes any uncompressed data into C<$buffer>. If the C<Append> parameter is
set in the constructor, the uncompressed data will be appended to the
C<$buffer> parameter. Otherwise C<$buffer> will be overwritten.

Returns the number of uncompressed bytes written to C<$buffer>, zero if eof
or a negative number on error.

=head2 read

Usage is

    $status = $z->read($buffer, $length)
    $status = $z->read($buffer, $length, $offset)

    $status = read($z, $buffer, $length)
    $status = read($z, $buffer, $length, $offset)

Attempt to read C<$length> bytes of uncompressed data into C<$buffer>.

The main difference between this form of the C<read> method and the
previous one, is that this one will attempt to return I<exactly> C<$length>
bytes. The only circumstances that this function will not is if end-of-file
or an IO error is encountered.

Returns the number of uncompressed bytes written to C<$buffer>, zero if eof
or a negative number on error.

=head2 getline

Usage is

    $line = $z->getline()
    $line = <$z>

Reads a single line. 

This method fully supports the use of the variable C<$/> (or
C<$INPUT_RECORD_SEPARATOR> or C<$RS> when C<English> is in use) to
determine what constitutes an end of line. Paragraph mode, record mode and
file slurp mode are all supported. 

=head2 getc

Usage is 

    $char = $z->getc()

Read a single character.

=head2 ungetc

Usage is

    $char = $z->ungetc($string)

=head2 inflateSync

Usage is

    $status = $z->inflateSync()

TODO

=head2 getHeaderInfo

Usage is

    $hdr  = $z->getHeaderInfo();
    @hdrs = $z->getHeaderInfo();

This method returns either a hash reference (in scalar context) or a list
or hash references (in array context) that contains information about each
of the header fields in the compressed data stream(s).

=head2 tell

Usage is

    $z->tell()
    tell $z

Returns the uncompressed file offset.

=head2 eof

Usage is

    $z->eof();
    eof($z);

Returns true if the end of the compressed input stream has been reached.

=head2 seek

    $z->seek($position, $whence);
    seek($z, $position, $whence);

Provides a sub-set of the C<seek> functionality, with the restriction
that it is only legal to seek forward in the input file/buffer.
It is a fatal error to attempt to seek backward.

Note that the implementation of C<seek> in this module does not provide
true random access to a compressed file/buffer. It  works by uncompressing
data from the current offset in the file/buffer until it reaches the
uncompressed offset specified in the parameters to C<seek>. For very small
files this may be acceptable behaviour. For large files it may cause an
unacceptable delay.

The C<$whence> parameter takes one the usual values, namely SEEK_SET,
SEEK_CUR or SEEK_END.

Returns 1 on success, 0 on failure.

=head2 binmode

Usage is

    $z->binmode
    binmode $z ;

This is a noop provided for completeness.

=head2 opened

    $z->opened()

Returns true if the object currently refers to a opened file/buffer. 

=head2 autoflush

    my $prev = $z->autoflush()
    my $prev = $z->autoflush(EXPR)

If the C<$z> object is associated with a file or a filehandle, this method
returns the current autoflush setting for the underlying filehandle. If
C<EXPR> is present, and is non-zero, it will enable flushing after every
write/print operation.

If C<$z> is associated with a buffer, this method has no effect and always
returns C<undef>.

B<Note> that the special variable C<$|> B<cannot> be used to set or
retrieve the autoflush setting.

=head2 input_line_number

    $z->input_line_number()
    $z->input_line_number(EXPR)

Returns the current uncompressed line number. If C<EXPR> is present it has
the effect of setting the line number. Note that setting the line number
does not change the current position within the file/buffer being read.

The contents of C<$/> are used to determine what constitutes a line
terminator.

=head2 fileno

    $z->fileno()
    fileno($z)

If the C<$z> object is associated with a file or a filehandle, C<fileno>
will return the underlying file descriptor. Once the C<close> method is
called C<fileno> will return C<undef>.

If the C<$z> object is associated with a buffer, this method will return
C<undef>.

=head2 close

    $z->close() ;
    close $z ;

Closes the output file/buffer. 

For most versions of Perl this method will be automatically invoked if
the IO::Uncompress::RawInflate object is destroyed (either explicitly or by the
variable with the reference to the object going out of scope). The
exceptions are Perl versions 5.005 through 5.00504 and 5.8.0. In
these cases, the C<close> method will be called automatically, but
not until global destruction of all live objects when the program is
terminating.

Therefore, if you want your scripts to be able to run on all versions
of Perl, you should call C<close> explicitly and not rely on automatic
closing.

Returns true on success, otherwise 0.

If the C<AutoClose> option has been enabled when the IO::Uncompress::RawInflate
object was created, and the object is associated with a file, the
underlying file will also be closed.

=head2 nextStream

Usage is

    my $status = $z->nextStream();

Skips to the next compressed data stream in the input file/buffer. If a new
compressed data stream is found, the eof marker will be cleared and C<$.>
will be reset to 0.

Returns 1 if a new stream was found, 0 if none was found, and -1 if an
error was encountered.

=head2 trailingData

Usage is

    my $data = $z->trailingData();

Returns the data, if any, that is present immediately after the compressed
data stream once uncompression is complete. It only makes sense to call
this method once the end of the compressed data stream has been
encountered.

This option can be used when there is useful information immediately
following the compressed data stream, and you don't know the length of the
compressed data stream.

If the input is a buffer, C<trailingData> will return everything from the
end of the compressed data stream to the end of the buffer.

If the input is a filehandle, C<trailingData> will return the data that is
left in the filehandle input buffer once the end of the compressed data
stream has been reached. You can then use the filehandle to read the rest
of the input file. 

Don't bother using C<trailingData> if the input is a filename.

If you know the length of the compressed data stream before you start
uncompressing, you can avoid having to use C<trailingData> by setting the
C<InputLength> option in the constructor.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module provides a Perl interface that allows the reading of
files/buffers that conform to RFC 1952.

For writing RFC 1952 files/buffers, see the companion module IO::Compress::Gzip.

=head1 Functional Interface

A top-level function, C<gunzip>, is provided to carry out
"one-shot" uncompression between buffers and/or files. For finer
control over the uncompression process, see the L</"OO Interface">
section.

    use IO::Uncompress::Gunzip qw(gunzip $GunzipError) ;

    gunzip $input_filename_or_reference => $output_filename_or_reference [,OPTS] 
        or die "gunzip failed: $GunzipError\n";

The functional interface needs Perl5.005 or better.

=head2 gunzip $input_filename_or_reference => $output_filename_or_reference [, OPTS]

C<gunzip> expects at least two parameters,
C<$input_filename_or_reference> and C<$output_filename_or_reference>.

=head3 The C<$input_filename_or_reference> parameter

The parameter, C<$input_filename_or_reference>, is used to define the
source of the compressed data. 

It can take one of the following forms:

=over 5

=item A filename

If the <$input_filename_or_reference> parameter is a simple scalar, it is
assumed to be a filename. This file will be opened for reading and the
input data will be read from it.

=item A filehandle

If the C<$input_filename_or_reference> parameter is a filehandle, the input
data will be read from it.  The string '-' can be used as an alias for
standard input.

=item A scalar reference 

If C<$input_filename_or_reference> is a scalar reference, the input data
will be read from C<$$input_filename_or_reference>.

=item An array reference 

If C<$input_filename_or_reference> is an array reference, each element in
the array must be a filename.

The input data will be read from each file in turn. 

The complete array will be walked to ensure that it only
contains valid filenames before any data is uncompressed.

=item An Input FileGlob string

If C<$input_filename_or_reference> is a string that is delimited by the
characters "<" and ">" C<gunzip> will assume that it is an 
I<input fileglob string>. The input is the list of files that match the 
fileglob.

See L<File::GlobMapper|File::GlobMapper> for more details.

=back

If the C<$input_filename_or_reference> parameter is any other type,
C<undef> will be returned.

=head3 The C<$output_filename_or_reference> parameter

The parameter C<$output_filename_or_reference> is used to control the
destination of the uncompressed data. This parameter can take one of
these forms.

=over 5

=item A filename

If the C<$output_filename_or_reference> parameter is a simple scalar, it is
assumed to be a filename.  This file will be opened for writing and the 
uncompressed data will be written to it.

=item A filehandle

If the C<$output_filename_or_reference> parameter is a filehandle, the
uncompressed data will be written to it.  The string '-' can be used as
an alias for standard output.

=item A scalar reference 

If C<$output_filename_or_reference> is a scalar reference, the
uncompressed data will be stored in C<$$output_filename_or_reference>.

=item An Array Reference

If C<$output_filename_or_reference> is an array reference, 
the uncompressed data will be pushed onto the array.

=item An Output FileGlob

If C<$output_filename_or_reference> is a string that is delimited by the
characters "<" and ">" C<gunzip> will assume that it is an
I<output fileglob string>. The output is the list of files that match the
fileglob.

When C<$output_filename_or_reference> is an fileglob string,
C<$input_filename_or_reference> must also be a fileglob string. Anything
else is an error.

See L<File::GlobMapper|File::GlobMapper> for more details.

=back

If the C<$output_filename_or_reference> parameter is any other type,
C<undef> will be returned.

=head2 Notes

When C<$input_filename_or_reference> maps to multiple compressed
files/buffers and C<$output_filename_or_reference> is
a single file/buffer, after uncompression C<$output_filename_or_reference> will contain a
concatenation of all the uncompressed data from each of the input
files/buffers.

=head2 Optional Parameters

Unless specified below, the optional parameters for C<gunzip>,
C<OPTS>, are the same as those used with the OO interface defined in the
L</"Constructor Options"> section below.

=over 5

=item C<< AutoClose => 0|1 >>

This option applies to any input or output data streams to 
C<gunzip> that are filehandles.

If C<AutoClose> is specified, and the value is true, it will result in all
input and/or output filehandles being closed once C<gunzip> has
completed.

This parameter defaults to 0.

=item C<< BinModeOut => 0|1 >>

When writing to a file or filehandle, set C<binmode> before writing to the
file.

Defaults to 0.

=item C<< Append => 0|1 >>

The behaviour of this option is dependent on the type of output data
stream.

=over 5

=item * A Buffer

If C<Append> is enabled, all uncompressed data will be append to the end of
the output buffer. Otherwise the output buffer will be cleared before any
uncompressed data is written to it.

=item * A Filename

If C<Append> is enabled, the file will be opened in append mode. Otherwise
the contents of the file, if any, will be truncated before any uncompressed
data is written to it.

=item * A Filehandle

If C<Append> is enabled, the filehandle will be positioned to the end of
the file via a call to C<seek> before any uncompressed data is
written to it.  Otherwise the file pointer will not be moved.

=back

When C<Append> is specified, and set to true, it will I<append> all uncompressed 
data to the output data stream.

So when the output is a filehandle it will carry out a seek to the eof
before writing any uncompressed data. If the output is a filename, it will be opened for
appending. If the output is a buffer, all uncompressed data will be
appended to the existing buffer.

Conversely when C<Append> is not specified, or it is present and is set to
false, it will operate as follows.

When the output is a filename, it will truncate the contents of the file
before writing any uncompressed data. If the output is a filehandle
its position will not be changed. If the output is a buffer, it will be
wiped before any uncompressed data is output.

Defaults to 0.

=item C<< MultiStream => 0|1 >>

If the input file/buffer contains multiple compressed data streams, this
option will uncompress the whole lot as a single data stream.

Defaults to 0.

=item C<< TrailingData => $scalar >>

Returns the data, if any, that is present immediately after the compressed
data stream once uncompression is complete. 

This option can be used when there is useful information immediately
following the compressed data stream, and you don't know the length of the
compressed data stream.

If the input is a buffer, C<trailingData> will return everything from the
end of the compressed data stream to the end of the buffer.

If the input is a filehandle, C<trailingData> will return the data that is
left in the filehandle input buffer once the end of the compressed data
stream has been reached. You can then use the filehandle to read the rest
of the input file. 

Don't bother using C<trailingData> if the input is a filename.

If you know the length of the compressed data stream before you start
uncompressing, you can avoid having to use C<trailingData> by setting the
C<InputLength> option.

=back

=head2 Examples

To read the contents of the file C<file1.txt.gz> and write the
uncompressed data to the file C<file1.txt>.

    use strict ;
    use warnings ;
    use IO::Uncompress::Gunzip qw(gunzip $GunzipError) ;

    my $input = "file1.txt.gz";
    my $output = "file1.txt";
    gunzip $input => $output
        or die "gunzip failed: $GunzipError\n";

To read from an existing Perl filehandle, C<$input>, and write the
uncompressed data to a buffer, C<$buffer>.

    use strict ;
    use warnings ;
    use IO::Uncompress::Gunzip qw(gunzip $GunzipError) ;
    use IO::File ;

    my $input = new IO::File "<file1.txt.gz"
        or die "Cannot open 'file1.txt.gz': $!\n" ;
    my $buffer ;
    gunzip $input => \$buffer 
        or die "gunzip failed: $GunzipError\n";

To uncompress all files in the directory "/my/home" that match "*.txt.gz" and store the compressed data in the same directory

    use strict ;
    use warnings ;
    use IO::Uncompress::Gunzip qw(gunzip $GunzipError) ;

    gunzip '</my/home/*.txt.gz>' => '</my/home/#1.txt>'
        or die "gunzip failed: $GunzipError\n";

and if you want to compress each file one at a time, this will do the trick

    use strict ;
    use warnings ;
    use IO::Uncompress::Gunzip qw(gunzip $GunzipError) ;

    for my $input ( glob "/my/home/*.txt.gz" )
    {
        my $output = $input;
        $output =~ s/.gz// ;
        gunzip $input => $output 
            or die "Error compressing '$input': $GunzipError\n";
    }

=head1 OO Interface

=head2 Constructor

The format of the constructor for IO::Uncompress::Gunzip is shown below

    my $z = new IO::Uncompress::Gunzip $input [OPTS]
        or die "IO::Uncompress::Gunzip failed: $GunzipError\n";

Returns an C<IO::Uncompress::Gunzip> object on success and undef on failure.
The variable C<$GunzipError> will contain an error message on failure.

If you are running Perl 5.005 or better the object, C<$z>, returned from
IO::Uncompress::Gunzip can be used exactly like an L<IO::File|IO::File> filehandle.
This means that all normal input file operations can be carried out with
C<$z>.  For example, to read a line from a compressed file/buffer you can
use either of these forms

    $line = $z->getline();
    $line = <$z>;

The mandatory parameter C<$input> is used to determine the source of the
compressed data. This parameter can take one of three forms.

=over 5

=item A filename

If the C<$input> parameter is a scalar, it is assumed to be a filename. This
file will be opened for reading and the compressed data will be read from it.

=item A filehandle

If the C<$input> parameter is a filehandle, the compressed data will be
read from it.
The string '-' can be used as an alias for standard input.

=item A scalar reference 

If C<$input> is a scalar reference, the compressed data will be read from
C<$$input>.

=back

=head2 Constructor Options

The option names defined below are case insensitive and can be optionally
prefixed by a '-'.  So all of the following are valid

    -AutoClose
    -autoclose
    AUTOCLOSE
    autoclose

OPTS is a combination of the following options:

=over 5

=item C<< AutoClose => 0|1 >>

This option is only valid when the C<$input> parameter is a filehandle. If
specified, and the value is true, it will result in the file being closed once
either the C<close> method is called or the IO::Uncompress::Gunzip object is
destroyed.

This parameter defaults to 0.

=item C<< MultiStream => 0|1 >>

Allows multiple concatenated compressed streams to be treated as a single
compressed stream. Decompression will stop once either the end of the
file/buffer is reached, an error is encountered (premature eof, corrupt
compressed data) or the end of a stream is not immediately followed by the
start of another stream.

This parameter defaults to 0.

=item C<< Prime => $string >>

This option will uncompress the contents of C<$string> before processing the
input file/buffer.

This option can be useful when the compressed data is embedded in another
file/data structure and it is not possible to work out where the compressed
data begins without having to read the first few bytes. If this is the
case, the uncompression can be I<primed> with these bytes using this
option.

=item C<< Transparent => 0|1 >>

If this option is set and the input file/buffer is not compressed data,
the module will allow reading of it anyway.

In addition, if the input file/buffer does contain compressed data and
there is non-compressed data immediately following it, setting this option
will make this module treat the whole file/buffer as a single data stream.

This option defaults to 1.

=item C<< BlockSize => $num >>

When reading the compressed input data, IO::Uncompress::Gunzip will read it in
blocks of C<$num> bytes.

This option defaults to 4096.

=item C<< InputLength => $size >>

When present this option will limit the number of compressed bytes read
from the input file/buffer to C<$size>. This option can be used in the
situation where there is useful data directly after the compressed data
stream and you know beforehand the exact length of the compressed data
stream. 

This option is mostly used when reading from a filehandle, in which case
the file pointer will be left pointing to the first byte directly after the
compressed data stream.

This option defaults to off.

=item C<< Append => 0|1 >>

This option controls what the C<read> method does with uncompressed data.

If set to 1, all uncompressed data will be appended to the output parameter
of the C<read> method.

If set to 0, the contents of the output parameter of the C<read> method
will be overwritten by the uncompressed data.

Defaults to 0.

=item C<< Strict => 0|1 >>

This option controls whether the extra checks defined below are used when
carrying out the decompression. When Strict is on, the extra tests are
carried out, when Strict is off they are not.

The default for this option is off.

=over 5

=item 1 

If the FHCRC bit is set in the gzip FLG header byte, the CRC16 bytes in the
header must match the crc16 value of the gzip header actually read.

=item 2

If the gzip header contains a name field (FNAME) it consists solely of ISO
8859-1 characters.

=item 3

If the gzip header contains a comment field (FCOMMENT) it consists solely
of ISO 8859-1 characters plus line-feed.

=item 4

If the gzip FEXTRA header field is present it must conform to the sub-field
structure as defined in RFC 1952.

=item 5

The CRC32 and ISIZE trailer fields must be present.

=item 6

The value of the CRC32 field read must match the crc32 value of the
uncompressed data actually contained in the gzip file.

=item 7

The value of the ISIZE fields read must match the length of the
uncompressed data actually read from the file.

=back

=item C<< ParseExtra => 0|1 >>
If the gzip FEXTRA header field is present and this option is set, it will
force the module to check that it conforms to the sub-field structure as
defined in RFC 1952.

If the C<Strict> is on it will automatically enable this option.

Defaults to 0.

=back

=head2 Examples

TODO

=head1 Methods 

=head2 read

Usage is

    $status = $z->read($buffer)

Reads a block of compressed data (the size of the compressed block is
determined by the C<Buffer> option in the constructor), uncompresses it and
writes any uncompressed data into C<$buffer>. If the C<Append> parameter is
set in the constructor, the uncompressed data will be appended to the
C<$buffer> parameter. Otherwise C<$buffer> will be overwritten.

Returns the number of uncompressed bytes written to C<$buffer>, zero if eof
or a negative number on error.

=head2 read

Usage is

    $status = $z->read($buffer, $length)
    $status = $z->read($buffer, $length, $offset)

    $status = read($z, $buffer, $length)
    $status = read($z, $buffer, $length, $offset)

Attempt to read C<$length> bytes of uncompressed data into C<$buffer>.

The main difference between this form of the C<read> method and the
previous one, is that this one will attempt to return I<exactly> C<$length>
bytes. The only circumstances that this function will not is if end-of-file
or an IO error is encountered.

Returns the number of uncompressed bytes written to C<$buffer>, zero if eof
or a negative number on error.

=head2 getline

Usage is

    $line = $z->getline()
    $line = <$z>

Reads a single line. 

This method fully supports the use of the variable C<$/> (or
C<$INPUT_RECORD_SEPARATOR> or C<$RS> when C<English> is in use) to
determine what constitutes an end of line. Paragraph mode, record mode and
file slurp mode are all supported. 

=head2 getc

Usage is 

    $char = $z->getc()

Read a single character.

=head2 ungetc

Usage is

    $char = $z->ungetc($string)

=head2 inflateSync

Usage is

    $status = $z->inflateSync()

TODO

=head2 getHeaderInfo

Usage is

    $hdr  = $z->getHeaderInfo();
    @hdrs = $z->getHeaderInfo();

This method returns either a hash reference (in scalar context) or a list
or hash references (in array context) that contains information about each
of the header fields in the compressed data stream(s).

=over 5

=item Name

The contents of the Name header field, if present. If no name is
present, the value will be undef. Note this is different from a zero length
name, which will return an empty string.

=item Comment

The contents of the Comment header field, if present. If no comment is
present, the value will be undef. Note this is different from a zero length
comment, which will return an empty string.

=back

=head2 tell

Usage is

    $z->tell()
    tell $z

Returns the uncompressed file offset.

=head2 eof

Usage is

    $z->eof();
    eof($z);

Returns true if the end of the compressed input stream has been reached.

=head2 seek

    $z->seek($position, $whence);
    seek($z, $position, $whence);

Provides a sub-set of the C<seek> functionality, with the restriction
that it is only legal to seek forward in the input file/buffer.
It is a fatal error to attempt to seek backward.

Note that the implementation of C<seek> in this module does not provide
true random access to a compressed file/buffer. It  works by uncompressing
data from the current offset in the file/buffer until it reaches the
uncompressed offset specified in the parameters to C<seek>. For very small
files this may be acceptable behaviour. For large files it may cause an
unacceptable delay.

The C<$whence> parameter takes one the usual values, namely SEEK_SET,
SEEK_CUR or SEEK_END.

Returns 1 on success, 0 on failure.

=head2 binmode

Usage is

    $z->binmode
    binmode $z ;

This is a noop provided for completeness.

=head2 opened

    $z->opened()

Returns true if the object currently refers to a opened file/buffer. 

=head2 autoflush

    my $prev = $z->autoflush()
    my $prev = $z->autoflush(EXPR)

If the C<$z> object is associated with a file or a filehandle, this method
returns the current autoflush setting for the underlying filehandle. If
C<EXPR> is present, and is non-zero, it will enable flushing after every
write/print operation.

If C<$z> is associated with a buffer, this method has no effect and always
returns C<undef>.

B<Note> that the special variable C<$|> B<cannot> be used to set or
retrieve the autoflush setting.

=head2 input_line_number

    $z->input_line_number()
    $z->input_line_number(EXPR)

Returns the current uncompressed line number. If C<EXPR> is present it has
the effect of setting the line number. Note that setting the line number
does not change the current position within the file/buffer being read.

The contents of C<$/> are used to determine what constitutes a line
terminator.

=head2 fileno

    $z->fileno()
    fileno($z)

If the C<$z> object is associated with a file or a filehandle, C<fileno>
will return the underlying file descriptor. Once the C<close> method is
called C<fileno> will return C<undef>.

If the C<$z> object is associated with a buffer, this method will return
C<undef>.

=head2 close

    $z->close() ;
    close $z ;

Closes the output file/buffer. 

For most versions of Perl this method will be automatically invoked if
the IO::Uncompress::Gunzip object is destroyed (either explicitly or by the
variable with the reference to the object going out of scope). The
exceptions are Perl versions 5.005 through 5.00504 and 5.8.0. In
these cases, the C<close> method will be called automatically, but
not until global destruction of all live objects when the program is
terminating.

Therefore, if you want your scripts to be able to run on all versions
of Perl, you should call C<close> explicitly and not rely on automatic
closing.

Returns true on success, otherwise 0.

If the C<AutoClose> option has been enabled when the IO::Uncompress::Gunzip
object was created, and the object is associated with a file, the
underlying file will also be closed.

=head2 nextStream

Usage is

    my $status = $z->nextStream();

Skips to the next compressed data stream in the input file/buffer. If a new
compressed data stream is found, the eof marker will be cleared and C<$.>
will be reset to 0.

Returns 1 if a new stream was found, 0 if none was found, and -1 if an
error was encountered.

=head2 trailingData

Usage is

    my $data = $z->trailingData();

Returns the data, if any, that is present immediately after the compressed
data stream once uncompression is complete. It only makes sense to call
this method once the end of the compressed data stream has been
encountered.

This option can be used when there is useful information immediately
following the compressed data stream, and you don't know the length of the
compressed data stream.

If the input is a buffer, C<trailingData> will return everything from the
end of the compressed data stream to the end of the buffer.

If the input is a filehandle, C<trailingData> will return the data that is
left in the filehandle input buffer once the end of the compressed data
stream has been reached. You can then use the filehandle to read the rest
of the input file. 

Don't bother using C<trailingData> if the input is a filename.

If you know the length of the compressed data stream before you start
uncompressing, you can avoid having to use C<trailingData> by setting the
C<InputLength> option in the constructor.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module provides a Perl interface that allows the reading of
files/buffers that conform to RFC 1950.

For writing RFC 1950 files/buffers, see the companion module IO::Compress::Deflate.

=head1 Functional Interface

A top-level function, C<inflate>, is provided to carry out
"one-shot" uncompression between buffers and/or files. For finer
control over the uncompression process, see the L</"OO Interface">
section.

    use IO::Uncompress::Inflate qw(inflate $InflateError) ;

    inflate $input_filename_or_reference => $output_filename_or_reference [,OPTS] 
        or die "inflate failed: $InflateError\n";

The functional interface needs Perl5.005 or better.

=head2 inflate $input_filename_or_reference => $output_filename_or_reference [, OPTS]

C<inflate> expects at least two parameters,
C<$input_filename_or_reference> and C<$output_filename_or_reference>.

=head3 The C<$input_filename_or_reference> parameter

The parameter, C<$input_filename_or_reference>, is used to define the
source of the compressed data. 

It can take one of the following forms:

=over 5

=item A filename

If the <$input_filename_or_reference> parameter is a simple scalar, it is
assumed to be a filename. This file will be opened for reading and the
input data will be read from it.

=item A filehandle

If the C<$input_filename_or_reference> parameter is a filehandle, the input
data will be read from it.  The string '-' can be used as an alias for
standard input.

=item A scalar reference 

If C<$input_filename_or_reference> is a scalar reference, the input data
will be read from C<$$input_filename_or_reference>.

=item An array reference 

If C<$input_filename_or_reference> is an array reference, each element in
the array must be a filename.

The input data will be read from each file in turn. 

The complete array will be walked to ensure that it only
contains valid filenames before any data is uncompressed.

=item An Input FileGlob string

If C<$input_filename_or_reference> is a string that is delimited by the
characters "<" and ">" C<inflate> will assume that it is an 
I<input fileglob string>. The input is the list of files that match the 
fileglob.

See L<File::GlobMapper|File::GlobMapper> for more details.

=back

If the C<$input_filename_or_reference> parameter is any other type,
C<undef> will be returned.

=head3 The C<$output_filename_or_reference> parameter

The parameter C<$output_filename_or_reference> is used to control the
destination of the uncompressed data. This parameter can take one of
these forms.

=over 5

=item A filename

If the C<$output_filename_or_reference> parameter is a simple scalar, it is
assumed to be a filename.  This file will be opened for writing and the 
uncompressed data will be written to it.

=item A filehandle

If the C<$output_filename_or_reference> parameter is a filehandle, the
uncompressed data will be written to it.  The string '-' can be used as
an alias for standard output.

=item A scalar reference 

If C<$output_filename_or_reference> is a scalar reference, the
uncompressed data will be stored in C<$$output_filename_or_reference>.

=item An Array Reference

If C<$output_filename_or_reference> is an array reference, 
the uncompressed data will be pushed onto the array.

=item An Output FileGlob

If C<$output_filename_or_reference> is a string that is delimited by the
characters "<" and ">" C<inflate> will assume that it is an
I<output fileglob string>. The output is the list of files that match the
fileglob.

When C<$output_filename_or_reference> is an fileglob string,
C<$input_filename_or_reference> must also be a fileglob string. Anything
else is an error.

See L<File::GlobMapper|File::GlobMapper> for more details.

=back

If the C<$output_filename_or_reference> parameter is any other type,
C<undef> will be returned.

=head2 Notes

When C<$input_filename_or_reference> maps to multiple compressed
files/buffers and C<$output_filename_or_reference> is
a single file/buffer, after uncompression C<$output_filename_or_reference> will contain a
concatenation of all the uncompressed data from each of the input
files/buffers.

=head2 Optional Parameters

Unless specified below, the optional parameters for C<inflate>,
C<OPTS>, are the same as those used with the OO interface defined in the
L</"Constructor Options"> section below.

=over 5

=item C<< AutoClose => 0|1 >>

This option applies to any input or output data streams to 
C<inflate> that are filehandles.

If C<AutoClose> is specified, and the value is true, it will result in all
input and/or output filehandles being closed once C<inflate> has
completed.

This parameter defaults to 0.

=item C<< BinModeOut => 0|1 >>

When writing to a file or filehandle, set C<binmode> before writing to the
file.

Defaults to 0.

=item C<< Append => 0|1 >>

The behaviour of this option is dependent on the type of output data
stream.

=over 5

=item * A Buffer

If C<Append> is enabled, all uncompressed data will be append to the end of
the output buffer. Otherwise the output buffer will be cleared before any
uncompressed data is written to it.

=item * A Filename

If C<Append> is enabled, the file will be opened in append mode. Otherwise
the contents of the file, if any, will be truncated before any uncompressed
data is written to it.

=item * A Filehandle

If C<Append> is enabled, the filehandle will be positioned to the end of
the file via a call to C<seek> before any uncompressed data is
written to it.  Otherwise the file pointer will not be moved.

=back

When C<Append> is specified, and set to true, it will I<append> all uncompressed 
data to the output data stream.

So when the output is a filehandle it will carry out a seek to the eof
before writing any uncompressed data. If the output is a filename, it will be opened for
appending. If the output is a buffer, all uncompressed data will be
appended to the existing buffer.

Conversely when C<Append> is not specified, or it is present and is set to
false, it will operate as follows.

When the output is a filename, it will truncate the contents of the file
before writing any uncompressed data. If the output is a filehandle
its position will not be changed. If the output is a buffer, it will be
wiped before any uncompressed data is output.

Defaults to 0.

=item C<< MultiStream => 0|1 >>

If the input file/buffer contains multiple compressed data streams, this
option will uncompress the whole lot as a single data stream.

Defaults to 0.

=item C<< TrailingData => $scalar >>

Returns the data, if any, that is present immediately after the compressed
data stream once uncompression is complete. 

This option can be used when there is useful information immediately
following the compressed data stream, and you don't know the length of the
compressed data stream.

If the input is a buffer, C<trailingData> will return everything from the
end of the compressed data stream to the end of the buffer.

If the input is a filehandle, C<trailingData> will return the data that is
left in the filehandle input buffer once the end of the compressed data
stream has been reached. You can then use the filehandle to read the rest
of the input file. 

Don't bother using C<trailingData> if the input is a filename.

If you know the length of the compressed data stream before you start
uncompressing, you can avoid having to use C<trailingData> by setting the
C<InputLength> option.

=back

=head2 Examples

To read the contents of the file C<file1.txt.1950> and write the
uncompressed data to the file C<file1.txt>.

    use strict ;
    use warnings ;
    use IO::Uncompress::Inflate qw(inflate $InflateError) ;

    my $input = "file1.txt.1950";
    my $output = "file1.txt";
    inflate $input => $output
        or die "inflate failed: $InflateError\n";

To read from an existing Perl filehandle, C<$input>, and write the
uncompressed data to a buffer, C<$buffer>.

    use strict ;
    use warnings ;
    use IO::Uncompress::Inflate qw(inflate $InflateError) ;
    use IO::File ;

    my $input = new IO::File "<file1.txt.1950"
        or die "Cannot open 'file1.txt.1950': $!\n" ;
    my $buffer ;
    inflate $input => \$buffer 
        or die "inflate failed: $InflateError\n";

To uncompress all files in the directory "/my/home" that match "*.txt.1950" and store the compressed data in the same directory

    use strict ;
    use warnings ;
    use IO::Uncompress::Inflate qw(inflate $InflateError) ;

    inflate '</my/home/*.txt.1950>' => '</my/home/#1.txt>'
        or die "inflate failed: $InflateError\n";

and if you want to compress each file one at a time, this will do the trick

    use strict ;
    use warnings ;
    use IO::Uncompress::Inflate qw(inflate $InflateError) ;

    for my $input ( glob "/my/home/*.txt.1950" )
    {
        my $output = $input;
        $output =~ s/.1950// ;
        inflate $input => $output 
            or die "Error compressing '$input': $InflateError\n";
    }

=head1 OO Interface

=head2 Constructor

The format of the constructor for IO::Uncompress::Inflate is shown below

    my $z = new IO::Uncompress::Inflate $input [OPTS]
        or die "IO::Uncompress::Inflate failed: $InflateError\n";

Returns an C<IO::Uncompress::Inflate> object on success and undef on failure.
The variable C<$InflateError> will contain an error message on failure.

If you are running Perl 5.005 or better the object, C<$z>, returned from
IO::Uncompress::Inflate can be used exactly like an L<IO::File|IO::File> filehandle.
This means that all normal input file operations can be carried out with
C<$z>.  For example, to read a line from a compressed file/buffer you can
use either of these forms

    $line = $z->getline();
    $line = <$z>;

The mandatory parameter C<$input> is used to determine the source of the
compressed data. This parameter can take one of three forms.

=over 5

=item A filename

If the C<$input> parameter is a scalar, it is assumed to be a filename. This
file will be opened for reading and the compressed data will be read from it.

=item A filehandle

If the C<$input> parameter is a filehandle, the compressed data will be
read from it.
The string '-' can be used as an alias for standard input.

=item A scalar reference 

If C<$input> is a scalar reference, the compressed data will be read from
C<$$input>.

=back

=head2 Constructor Options

The option names defined below are case insensitive and can be optionally
prefixed by a '-'.  So all of the following are valid

    -AutoClose
    -autoclose
    AUTOCLOSE
    autoclose

OPTS is a combination of the following options:

=over 5

=item C<< AutoClose => 0|1 >>

This option is only valid when the C<$input> parameter is a filehandle. If
specified, and the value is true, it will result in the file being closed once
either the C<close> method is called or the IO::Uncompress::Inflate object is
destroyed.

This parameter defaults to 0.

=item C<< MultiStream => 0|1 >>

Allows multiple concatenated compressed streams to be treated as a single
compressed stream. Decompression will stop once either the end of the
file/buffer is reached, an error is encountered (premature eof, corrupt
compressed data) or the end of a stream is not immediately followed by the
start of another stream.

This parameter defaults to 0.

=item C<< Prime => $string >>

This option will uncompress the contents of C<$string> before processing the
input file/buffer.

This option can be useful when the compressed data is embedded in another
file/data structure and it is not possible to work out where the compressed
data begins without having to read the first few bytes. If this is the
case, the uncompression can be I<primed> with these bytes using this
option.

=item C<< Transparent => 0|1 >>

If this option is set and the input file/buffer is not compressed data,
the module will allow reading of it anyway.

In addition, if the input file/buffer does contain compressed data and
there is non-compressed data immediately following it, setting this option
will make this module treat the whole file/buffer as a single data stream.

This option defaults to 1.

=item C<< BlockSize => $num >>

When reading the compressed input data, IO::Uncompress::Inflate will read it in
blocks of C<$num> bytes.

This option defaults to 4096.

=item C<< InputLength => $size >>

When present this option will limit the number of compressed bytes read
from the input file/buffer to C<$size>. This option can be used in the
situation where there is useful data directly after the compressed data
stream and you know beforehand the exact length of the compressed data
stream. 

This option is mostly used when reading from a filehandle, in which case
the file pointer will be left pointing to the first byte directly after the
compressed data stream.

This option defaults to off.

=item C<< Append => 0|1 >>

This option controls what the C<read> method does with uncompressed data.

If set to 1, all uncompressed data will be appended to the output parameter
of the C<read> method.

If set to 0, the contents of the output parameter of the C<read> method
will be overwritten by the uncompressed data.

Defaults to 0.

=item C<< Strict => 0|1 >>

This option controls whether the extra checks defined below are used when
carrying out the decompression. When Strict is on, the extra tests are
carried out, when Strict is off they are not.

The default for this option is off.

=over 5

=item 1

The ADLER32 checksum field must be present.

=item 2

The value of the ADLER32 field read must match the adler32 value of the
uncompressed data actually contained in the file.

=back

=back

=head2 Examples

TODO

=head1 Methods 

=head2 read

Usage is

    $status = $z->read($buffer)

Reads a block of compressed data (the size of the compressed block is
determined by the C<Buffer> option in the constructor), uncompresses it and
writes any uncompressed data into C<$buffer>. If the C<Append> parameter is
set in the constructor, the uncompressed data will be appended to the
C<$buffer> parameter. Otherwise C<$buffer> will be overwritten.

Returns the number of uncompressed bytes written to C<$buffer>, zero if eof
or a negative number on error.

=head2 read

Usage is

    $status = $z->read($buffer, $length)
    $status = $z->read($buffer, $length, $offset)

    $status = read($z, $buffer, $length)
    $status = read($z, $buffer, $length, $offset)

Attempt to read C<$length> bytes of uncompressed data into C<$buffer>.

The main difference between this form of the C<read> method and the
previous one, is that this one will attempt to return I<exactly> C<$length>
bytes. The only circumstances that this function will not is if end-of-file
or an IO error is encountered.

Returns the number of uncompressed bytes written to C<$buffer>, zero if eof
or a negative number on error.

=head2 getline

Usage is

    $line = $z->getline()
    $line = <$z>

Reads a single line. 

This method fully supports the use of the variable C<$/> (or
C<$INPUT_RECORD_SEPARATOR> or C<$RS> when C<English> is in use) to
determine what constitutes an end of line. Paragraph mode, record mode and
file slurp mode are all supported. 

=head2 getc

Usage is 

    $char = $z->getc()

Read a single character.

=head2 ungetc

Usage is

    $char = $z->ungetc($string)

=head2 inflateSync

Usage is

    $status = $z->inflateSync()

TODO

=head2 getHeaderInfo

Usage is

    $hdr  = $z->getHeaderInfo();
    @hdrs = $z->getHeaderInfo();

This method returns either a hash reference (in scalar context) or a list
or hash references (in array context) that contains information about each
of the header fields in the compressed data stream(s).

=head2 tell

Usage is

    $z->tell()
    tell $z

Returns the uncompressed file offset.

=head2 eof

Usage is

    $z->eof();
    eof($z);

Returns true if the end of the compressed input stream has been reached.

=head2 seek

    $z->seek($position, $whence);
    seek($z, $position, $whence);

Provides a sub-set of the C<seek> functionality, with the restriction
that it is only legal to seek forward in the input file/buffer.
It is a fatal error to attempt to seek backward.

Note that the implementation of C<seek> in this module does not provide
true random access to a compressed file/buffer. It  works by uncompressing
data from the current offset in the file/buffer until it reaches the
uncompressed offset specified in the parameters to C<seek>. For very small
files this may be acceptable behaviour. For large files it may cause an
unacceptable delay.

The C<$whence> parameter takes one the usual values, namely SEEK_SET,
SEEK_CUR or SEEK_END.

Returns 1 on success, 0 on failure.

=head2 binmode

Usage is

    $z->binmode
    binmode $z ;

This is a noop provided for completeness.

=head2 opened

    $z->opened()

Returns true if the object currently refers to a opened file/buffer. 

=head2 autoflush

    my $prev = $z->autoflush()
    my $prev = $z->autoflush(EXPR)

If the C<$z> object is associated with a file or a filehandle, this method
returns the current autoflush setting for the underlying filehandle. If
C<EXPR> is present, and is non-zero, it will enable flushing after every
write/print operation.

If C<$z> is associated with a buffer, this method has no effect and always
returns C<undef>.

B<Note> that the special variable C<$|> B<cannot> be used to set or
retrieve the autoflush setting.

=head2 input_line_number

    $z->input_line_number()
    $z->input_line_number(EXPR)

Returns the current uncompressed line number. If C<EXPR> is present it has
the effect of setting the line number. Note that setting the line number
does not change the current position within the file/buffer being read.

The contents of C<$/> are used to determine what constitutes a line
terminator.

=head2 fileno

    $z->fileno()
    fileno($z)

If the C<$z> object is associated with a file or a filehandle, C<fileno>
will return the underlying file descriptor. Once the C<close> method is
called C<fileno> will return C<undef>.

If the C<$z> object is associated with a buffer, this method will return
C<undef>.

=head2 close

    $z->close() ;
    close $z ;

Closes the output file/buffer. 

For most versions of Perl this method will be automatically invoked if
the IO::Uncompress::Inflate object is destroyed (either explicitly or by the
variable with the reference to the object going out of scope). The
exceptions are Perl versions 5.005 through 5.00504 and 5.8.0. In
these cases, the C<close> method will be called automatically, but
not until global destruction of all live objects when the program is
terminating.

Therefore, if you want your scripts to be able to run on all versions
of Perl, you should call C<close> explicitly and not rely on automatic
closing.

Returns true on success, otherwise 0.

If the C<AutoClose> option has been enabled when the IO::Uncompress::Inflate
object was created, and the object is associated with a file, the
underlying file will also be closed.

=head2 nextStream

Usage is

    my $status = $z->nextStream();

Skips to the next compressed data stream in the input file/buffer. If a new
compressed data stream is found, the eof marker will be cleared and C<$.>
will be reset to 0.

Returns 1 if a new stream was found, 0 if none was found, and -1 if an
error was encountered.

=head2 trailingData

Usage is

    my $data = $z->trailingData();

Returns the data, if any, that is present immediately after the compressed
data stream once uncompression is complete. It only makes sense to call
this method once the end of the compressed data stream has been
encountered.

This option can be used when there is useful information immediately
following the compressed data stream, and you don't know the length of the
compressed data stream.

If the input is a buffer, C<trailingData> will return everything from the
end of the compressed data stream to the end of the buffer.

If the input is a filehandle, C<trailingData> will return the data that is
left in the filehandle input buffer once the end of the compressed data
stream has been reached. You can then use the filehandle to read the rest
of the input file. 

Don't bother using C<trailingData> if the input is a filename.

If you know the length of the compressed data stream before you start
uncompressing, you can avoid having to use C<trailingData> by setting the
C<InputLength> option in the constructor.

=head1 Importing 

No symbolic constants are required by this IO::Uncompress::Inflate at present.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module provides a Perl interface that allows the reading of
files/buffers that have been compressed with a variety of compression
libraries.

The formats supported are:

=over 5

=item RFC 1950

=item RFC 1951 (optionally)

=item gzip (RFC 1952)

=item zip

=item bzip2

=item lzop

=item lzf

=item lzma

=item xz

=back

The module will auto-detect which, if any, of the supported
compression formats is being used.

=head1 Functional Interface

A top-level function, C<anyuncompress>, is provided to carry out
"one-shot" uncompression between buffers and/or files. For finer
control over the uncompression process, see the L</"OO Interface">
section.

    use IO::Uncompress::AnyUncompress qw(anyuncompress $AnyUncompressError) ;

    anyuncompress $input_filename_or_reference => $output_filename_or_reference [,OPTS] 
        or die "anyuncompress failed: $AnyUncompressError\n";

The functional interface needs Perl5.005 or better.

=head2 anyuncompress $input_filename_or_reference => $output_filename_or_reference [, OPTS]

C<anyuncompress> expects at least two parameters,
C<$input_filename_or_reference> and C<$output_filename_or_reference>.

=head3 The C<$input_filename_or_reference> parameter

The parameter, C<$input_filename_or_reference>, is used to define the
source of the compressed data. 

It can take one of the following forms:

=over 5

=item A filename

If the <$input_filename_or_reference> parameter is a simple scalar, it is
assumed to be a filename. This file will be opened for reading and the
input data will be read from it.

=item A filehandle

If the C<$input_filename_or_reference> parameter is a filehandle, the input
data will be read from it.  The string '-' can be used as an alias for
standard input.

=item A scalar reference 

If C<$input_filename_or_reference> is a scalar reference, the input data
will be read from C<$$input_filename_or_reference>.

=item An array reference 

If C<$input_filename_or_reference> is an array reference, each element in
the array must be a filename.

The input data will be read from each file in turn. 

The complete array will be walked to ensure that it only
contains valid filenames before any data is uncompressed.

=item An Input FileGlob string

If C<$input_filename_or_reference> is a string that is delimited by the
characters "<" and ">" C<anyuncompress> will assume that it is an 
I<input fileglob string>. The input is the list of files that match the 
fileglob.

See L<File::GlobMapper|File::GlobMapper> for more details.

=back

If the C<$input_filename_or_reference> parameter is any other type,
C<undef> will be returned.

=head3 The C<$output_filename_or_reference> parameter

The parameter C<$output_filename_or_reference> is used to control the
destination of the uncompressed data. This parameter can take one of
these forms.

=over 5

=item A filename

If the C<$output_filename_or_reference> parameter is a simple scalar, it is
assumed to be a filename.  This file will be opened for writing and the 
uncompressed data will be written to it.

=item A filehandle

If the C<$output_filename_or_reference> parameter is a filehandle, the
uncompressed data will be written to it.  The string '-' can be used as
an alias for standard output.

=item A scalar reference 

If C<$output_filename_or_reference> is a scalar reference, the
uncompressed data will be stored in C<$$output_filename_or_reference>.

=item An Array Reference

If C<$output_filename_or_reference> is an array reference, 
the uncompressed data will be pushed onto the array.

=item An Output FileGlob

If C<$output_filename_or_reference> is a string that is delimited by the
characters "<" and ">" C<anyuncompress> will assume that it is an
I<output fileglob string>. The output is the list of files that match the
fileglob.

When C<$output_filename_or_reference> is an fileglob string,
C<$input_filename_or_reference> must also be a fileglob string. Anything
else is an error.

See L<File::GlobMapper|File::GlobMapper> for more details.

=back

If the C<$output_filename_or_reference> parameter is any other type,
C<undef> will be returned.

=head2 Notes

When C<$input_filename_or_reference> maps to multiple compressed
files/buffers and C<$output_filename_or_reference> is
a single file/buffer, after uncompression C<$output_filename_or_reference> will contain a
concatenation of all the uncompressed data from each of the input
files/buffers.

=head2 Optional Parameters

Unless specified below, the optional parameters for C<anyuncompress>,
C<OPTS>, are the same as those used with the OO interface defined in the
L</"Constructor Options"> section below.

=over 5

=item C<< AutoClose => 0|1 >>

This option applies to any input or output data streams to 
C<anyuncompress> that are filehandles.

If C<AutoClose> is specified, and the value is true, it will result in all
input and/or output filehandles being closed once C<anyuncompress> has
completed.

This parameter defaults to 0.

=item C<< BinModeOut => 0|1 >>

When writing to a file or filehandle, set C<binmode> before writing to the
file.

Defaults to 0.

=item C<< Append => 0|1 >>

The behaviour of this option is dependent on the type of output data
stream.

=over 5

=item * A Buffer

If C<Append> is enabled, all uncompressed data will be append to the end of
the output buffer. Otherwise the output buffer will be cleared before any
uncompressed data is written to it.

=item * A Filename

If C<Append> is enabled, the file will be opened in append mode. Otherwise
the contents of the file, if any, will be truncated before any uncompressed
data is written to it.

=item * A Filehandle

If C<Append> is enabled, the filehandle will be positioned to the end of
the file via a call to C<seek> before any uncompressed data is
written to it.  Otherwise the file pointer will not be moved.

=back

When C<Append> is specified, and set to true, it will I<append> all uncompressed 
data to the output data stream.

So when the output is a filehandle it will carry out a seek to the eof
before writing any uncompressed data. If the output is a filename, it will be opened for
appending. If the output is a buffer, all uncompressed data will be
appended to the existing buffer.

Conversely when C<Append> is not specified, or it is present and is set to
false, it will operate as follows.

When the output is a filename, it will truncate the contents of the file
before writing any uncompressed data. If the output is a filehandle
its position will not be changed. If the output is a buffer, it will be
wiped before any uncompressed data is output.

Defaults to 0.

=item C<< MultiStream => 0|1 >>

If the input file/buffer contains multiple compressed data streams, this
option will uncompress the whole lot as a single data stream.

Defaults to 0.

=item C<< TrailingData => $scalar >>

Returns the data, if any, that is present immediately after the compressed
data stream once uncompression is complete. 

This option can be used when there is useful information immediately
following the compressed data stream, and you don't know the length of the
compressed data stream.

If the input is a buffer, C<trailingData> will return everything from the
end of the compressed data stream to the end of the buffer.

If the input is a filehandle, C<trailingData> will return the data that is
left in the filehandle input buffer once the end of the compressed data
stream has been reached. You can then use the filehandle to read the rest
of the input file. 

Don't bother using C<trailingData> if the input is a filename.

If you know the length of the compressed data stream before you start
uncompressing, you can avoid having to use C<trailingData> by setting the
C<InputLength> option.

=back

=head2 Examples

To read the contents of the file C<file1.txt.Compressed> and write the
uncompressed data to the file C<file1.txt>.

    use strict ;
    use warnings ;
    use IO::Uncompress::AnyUncompress qw(anyuncompress $AnyUncompressError) ;

    my $input = "file1.txt.Compressed";
    my $output = "file1.txt";
    anyuncompress $input => $output
        or die "anyuncompress failed: $AnyUncompressError\n";

To read from an existing Perl filehandle, C<$input>, and write the
uncompressed data to a buffer, C<$buffer>.

    use strict ;
    use warnings ;
    use IO::Uncompress::AnyUncompress qw(anyuncompress $AnyUncompressError) ;
    use IO::File ;

    my $input = new IO::File "<file1.txt.Compressed"
        or die "Cannot open 'file1.txt.Compressed': $!\n" ;
    my $buffer ;
    anyuncompress $input => \$buffer 
        or die "anyuncompress failed: $AnyUncompressError\n";

To uncompress all files in the directory "/my/home" that match "*.txt.Compressed" and store the compressed data in the same directory

    use strict ;
    use warnings ;
    use IO::Uncompress::AnyUncompress qw(anyuncompress $AnyUncompressError) ;

    anyuncompress '</my/home/*.txt.Compressed>' => '</my/home/#1.txt>'
        or die "anyuncompress failed: $AnyUncompressError\n";

and if you want to compress each file one at a time, this will do the trick

    use strict ;
    use warnings ;
    use IO::Uncompress::AnyUncompress qw(anyuncompress $AnyUncompressError) ;

    for my $input ( glob "/my/home/*.txt.Compressed" )
    {
        my $output = $input;
        $output =~ s/.Compressed// ;
        anyuncompress $input => $output 
            or die "Error compressing '$input': $AnyUncompressError\n";
    }

=head1 OO Interface

=head2 Constructor

The format of the constructor for IO::Uncompress::AnyUncompress is shown below

    my $z = new IO::Uncompress::AnyUncompress $input [OPTS]
        or die "IO::Uncompress::AnyUncompress failed: $AnyUncompressError\n";

Returns an C<IO::Uncompress::AnyUncompress> object on success and undef on failure.
The variable C<$AnyUncompressError> will contain an error message on failure.

If you are running Perl 5.005 or better the object, C<$z>, returned from
IO::Uncompress::AnyUncompress can be used exactly like an L<IO::File|IO::File> filehandle.
This means that all normal input file operations can be carried out with
C<$z>.  For example, to read a line from a compressed file/buffer you can
use either of these forms

    $line = $z->getline();
    $line = <$z>;

The mandatory parameter C<$input> is used to determine the source of the
compressed data. This parameter can take one of three forms.

=over 5

=item A filename

If the C<$input> parameter is a scalar, it is assumed to be a filename. This
file will be opened for reading and the compressed data will be read from it.

=item A filehandle

If the C<$input> parameter is a filehandle, the compressed data will be
read from it.
The string '-' can be used as an alias for standard input.

=item A scalar reference 

If C<$input> is a scalar reference, the compressed data will be read from
C<$$input>.

=back

=head2 Constructor Options

The option names defined below are case insensitive and can be optionally
prefixed by a '-'.  So all of the following are valid

    -AutoClose
    -autoclose
    AUTOCLOSE
    autoclose

OPTS is a combination of the following options:

=over 5

=item C<< AutoClose => 0|1 >>

This option is only valid when the C<$input> parameter is a filehandle. If
specified, and the value is true, it will result in the file being closed once
either the C<close> method is called or the IO::Uncompress::AnyUncompress object is
destroyed.

This parameter defaults to 0.

=item C<< MultiStream => 0|1 >>

Allows multiple concatenated compressed streams to be treated as a single
compressed stream. Decompression will stop once either the end of the
file/buffer is reached, an error is encountered (premature eof, corrupt
compressed data) or the end of a stream is not immediately followed by the
start of another stream.

This parameter defaults to 0.

=item C<< Prime => $string >>

This option will uncompress the contents of C<$string> before processing the
input file/buffer.

This option can be useful when the compressed data is embedded in another
file/data structure and it is not possible to work out where the compressed
data begins without having to read the first few bytes. If this is the
case, the uncompression can be I<primed> with these bytes using this
option.

=item C<< Transparent => 0|1 >>

If this option is set and the input file/buffer is not compressed data,
the module will allow reading of it anyway.

In addition, if the input file/buffer does contain compressed data and
there is non-compressed data immediately following it, setting this option
will make this module treat the whole file/buffer as a single data stream.

This option defaults to 1.

=item C<< BlockSize => $num >>

When reading the compressed input data, IO::Uncompress::AnyUncompress will read it in
blocks of C<$num> bytes.

This option defaults to 4096.

=item C<< InputLength => $size >>

When present this option will limit the number of compressed bytes read
from the input file/buffer to C<$size>. This option can be used in the
situation where there is useful data directly after the compressed data
stream and you know beforehand the exact length of the compressed data
stream. 

This option is mostly used when reading from a filehandle, in which case
the file pointer will be left pointing to the first byte directly after the
compressed data stream.

This option defaults to off.

=item C<< Append => 0|1 >>

This option controls what the C<read> method does with uncompressed data.

If set to 1, all uncompressed data will be appended to the output parameter
of the C<read> method.

If set to 0, the contents of the output parameter of the C<read> method
will be overwritten by the uncompressed data.

Defaults to 0.

=item C<< Strict => 0|1 >>

This option controls whether the extra checks defined below are used when
carrying out the decompression. When Strict is on, the extra tests are
carried out, when Strict is off they are not.

The default for this option is off.

=item C<< RawInflate => 0|1 >>

When auto-detecting the compressed format, try to test for raw-deflate (RFC
1951) content using the C<IO::Uncompress::RawInflate> module. 

The reason this is not default behaviour is because RFC 1951 content can
only be detected by attempting to uncompress it. This process is error
prone and can result is false positives.

Defaults to 0.

=item C<< UnLzma => 0|1 >>

When auto-detecting the compressed format, try to test for lzma_alone
content using the C<IO::Uncompress::UnLzma> module. 

The reason this is not default behaviour is because lzma_alone content can
only be detected by attempting to uncompress it. This process is error
prone and can result is false positives.

Defaults to 0.

=back

=head2 Examples

TODO

=head1 Methods 

=head2 read

Usage is

    $status = $z->read($buffer)

Reads a block of compressed data (the size of the compressed block is
determined by the C<Buffer> option in the constructor), uncompresses it and
writes any uncompressed data into C<$buffer>. If the C<Append> parameter is
set in the constructor, the uncompressed data will be appended to the
C<$buffer> parameter. Otherwise C<$buffer> will be overwritten.

Returns the number of uncompressed bytes written to C<$buffer>, zero if eof
or a negative number on error.

=head2 read

Usage is

    $status = $z->read($buffer, $length)
    $status = $z->read($buffer, $length, $offset)

    $status = read($z, $buffer, $length)
    $status = read($z, $buffer, $length, $offset)

Attempt to read C<$length> bytes of uncompressed data into C<$buffer>.

The main difference between this form of the C<read> method and the
previous one, is that this one will attempt to return I<exactly> C<$length>
bytes. The only circumstances that this function will not is if end-of-file
or an IO error is encountered.

Returns the number of uncompressed bytes written to C<$buffer>, zero if eof
or a negative number on error.

=head2 getline

Usage is

    $line = $z->getline()
    $line = <$z>

Reads a single line. 

This method fully supports the use of the variable C<$/> (or
C<$INPUT_RECORD_SEPARATOR> or C<$RS> when C<English> is in use) to
determine what constitutes an end of line. Paragraph mode, record mode and
file slurp mode are all supported. 

=head2 getc

Usage is 

    $char = $z->getc()

Read a single character.

=head2 ungetc

Usage is

    $char = $z->ungetc($string)

=head2 getHeaderInfo

Usage is

    $hdr  = $z->getHeaderInfo();
    @hdrs = $z->getHeaderInfo();

This method returns either a hash reference (in scalar context) or a list
or hash references (in array context) that contains information about each
of the header fields in the compressed data stream(s).

=head2 tell

Usage is

    $z->tell()
    tell $z

Returns the uncompressed file offset.

=head2 eof

Usage is

    $z->eof();
    eof($z);

Returns true if the end of the compressed input stream has been reached.

=head2 seek

    $z->seek($position, $whence);
    seek($z, $position, $whence);

Provides a sub-set of the C<seek> functionality, with the restriction
that it is only legal to seek forward in the input file/buffer.
It is a fatal error to attempt to seek backward.

Note that the implementation of C<seek> in this module does not provide
true random access to a compressed file/buffer. It  works by uncompressing
data from the current offset in the file/buffer until it reaches the
uncompressed offset specified in the parameters to C<seek>. For very small
files this may be acceptable behaviour. For large files it may cause an
unacceptable delay.

The C<$whence> parameter takes one the usual values, namely SEEK_SET,
SEEK_CUR or SEEK_END.

Returns 1 on success, 0 on failure.

=head2 binmode

Usage is

    $z->binmode
    binmode $z ;

This is a noop provided for completeness.

=head2 opened

    $z->opened()

Returns true if the object currently refers to a opened file/buffer. 

=head2 autoflush

    my $prev = $z->autoflush()
    my $prev = $z->autoflush(EXPR)

If the C<$z> object is associated with a file or a filehandle, this method
returns the current autoflush setting for the underlying filehandle. If
C<EXPR> is present, and is non-zero, it will enable flushing after every
write/print operation.

If C<$z> is associated with a buffer, this method has no effect and always
returns C<undef>.

B<Note> that the special variable C<$|> B<cannot> be used to set or
retrieve the autoflush setting.

=head2 input_line_number

    $z->input_line_number()
    $z->input_line_number(EXPR)

Returns the current uncompressed line number. If C<EXPR> is present it has
the effect of setting the line number. Note that setting the line number
does not change the current position within the file/buffer being read.

The contents of C<$/> are used to determine what constitutes a line
terminator.

=head2 fileno

    $z->fileno()
    fileno($z)

If the C<$z> object is associated with a file or a filehandle, C<fileno>
will return the underlying file descriptor. Once the C<close> method is
called C<fileno> will return C<undef>.

If the C<$z> object is associated with a buffer, this method will return
C<undef>.

=head2 close

    $z->close() ;
    close $z ;

Closes the output file/buffer. 

For most versions of Perl this method will be automatically invoked if
the IO::Uncompress::AnyUncompress object is destroyed (either explicitly or by the
variable with the reference to the object going out of scope). The
exceptions are Perl versions 5.005 through 5.00504 and 5.8.0. In
these cases, the C<close> method will be called automatically, but
not until global destruction of all live objects when the program is
terminating.

Therefore, if you want your scripts to be able to run on all versions
of Perl, you should call C<close> explicitly and not rely on automatic
closing.

Returns true on success, otherwise 0.

If the C<AutoClose> option has been enabled when the IO::Uncompress::AnyUncompress
object was created, and the object is associated with a file, the
underlying file will also be closed.

=head2 nextStream

Usage is

    my $status = $z->nextStream();

Skips to the next compressed data stream in the input file/buffer. If a new
compressed data stream is found, the eof marker will be cleared and C<$.>
will be reset to 0.

Returns 1 if a new stream was found, 0 if none was found, and -1 if an
error was encountered.

=head2 trailingData

Usage is

    my $data = $z->trailingData();

Returns the data, if any, that is present immediately after the compressed
data stream once uncompression is complete. It only makes sense to call
this method once the end of the compressed data stream has been
encountered.

This option can be used when there is useful information immediately
following the compressed data stream, and you don't know the length of the
compressed data stream.

If the input is a buffer, C<trailingData> will return everything from the
end of the compressed data stream to the end of the buffer.

If the input is a filehandle, C<trailingData> will return the data that is
left in the filehandle input buffer once the end of the compressed data
stream has been reached. You can then use the filehandle to read the rest
of the input file. 

Don't bother using C<trailingData> if the input is a filename.

If you know the length of the compressed data stream before you start
uncompressing, you can avoid having to use C<trailingData> by setting the
C<InputLength> option in the constructor.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module provides a Perl interface that allows the reading of
files/buffers that have been compressed in a number of formats that use the
zlib compression library.

The formats supported are

=over 5

=item RFC 1950

=item RFC 1951 (optionally)

=item gzip (RFC 1952)

=item zip

=back

The module will auto-detect which, if any, of the supported
compression formats is being used.

=head1 Functional Interface

A top-level function, C<anyinflate>, is provided to carry out
"one-shot" uncompression between buffers and/or files. For finer
control over the uncompression process, see the L</"OO Interface">
section.

    use IO::Uncompress::AnyInflate qw(anyinflate $AnyInflateError) ;

    anyinflate $input_filename_or_reference => $output_filename_or_reference [,OPTS] 
        or die "anyinflate failed: $AnyInflateError\n";

The functional interface needs Perl5.005 or better.

=head2 anyinflate $input_filename_or_reference => $output_filename_or_reference [, OPTS]

C<anyinflate> expects at least two parameters,
C<$input_filename_or_reference> and C<$output_filename_or_reference>.

=head3 The C<$input_filename_or_reference> parameter

The parameter, C<$input_filename_or_reference>, is used to define the
source of the compressed data. 

It can take one of the following forms:

=over 5

=item A filename

If the <$input_filename_or_reference> parameter is a simple scalar, it is
assumed to be a filename. This file will be opened for reading and the
input data will be read from it.

=item A filehandle

If the C<$input_filename_or_reference> parameter is a filehandle, the input
data will be read from it.  The string '-' can be used as an alias for
standard input.

=item A scalar reference 

If C<$input_filename_or_reference> is a scalar reference, the input data
will be read from C<$$input_filename_or_reference>.

=item An array reference 

If C<$input_filename_or_reference> is an array reference, each element in
the array must be a filename.

The input data will be read from each file in turn. 

The complete array will be walked to ensure that it only
contains valid filenames before any data is uncompressed.

=item An Input FileGlob string

If C<$input_filename_or_reference> is a string that is delimited by the
characters "<" and ">" C<anyinflate> will assume that it is an 
I<input fileglob string>. The input is the list of files that match the 
fileglob.

See L<File::GlobMapper|File::GlobMapper> for more details.

=back

If the C<$input_filename_or_reference> parameter is any other type,
C<undef> will be returned.

=head3 The C<$output_filename_or_reference> parameter

The parameter C<$output_filename_or_reference> is used to control the
destination of the uncompressed data. This parameter can take one of
these forms.

=over 5

=item A filename

If the C<$output_filename_or_reference> parameter is a simple scalar, it is
assumed to be a filename.  This file will be opened for writing and the 
uncompressed data will be written to it.

=item A filehandle

If the C<$output_filename_or_reference> parameter is a filehandle, the
uncompressed data will be written to it.  The string '-' can be used as
an alias for standard output.

=item A scalar reference 

If C<$output_filename_or_reference> is a scalar reference, the
uncompressed data will be stored in C<$$output_filename_or_reference>.

=item An Array Reference

If C<$output_filename_or_reference> is an array reference, 
the uncompressed data will be pushed onto the array.

=item An Output FileGlob

If C<$output_filename_or_reference> is a string that is delimited by the
characters "<" and ">" C<anyinflate> will assume that it is an
I<output fileglob string>. The output is the list of files that match the
fileglob.

When C<$output_filename_or_reference> is an fileglob string,
C<$input_filename_or_reference> must also be a fileglob string. Anything
else is an error.

See L<File::GlobMapper|File::GlobMapper> for more details.

=back

If the C<$output_filename_or_reference> parameter is any other type,
C<undef> will be returned.

=head2 Notes

When C<$input_filename_or_reference> maps to multiple compressed
files/buffers and C<$output_filename_or_reference> is
a single file/buffer, after uncompression C<$output_filename_or_reference> will contain a
concatenation of all the uncompressed data from each of the input
files/buffers.

=head2 Optional Parameters

Unless specified below, the optional parameters for C<anyinflate>,
C<OPTS>, are the same as those used with the OO interface defined in the
L</"Constructor Options"> section below.

=over 5

=item C<< AutoClose => 0|1 >>

This option applies to any input or output data streams to 
C<anyinflate> that are filehandles.

If C<AutoClose> is specified, and the value is true, it will result in all
input and/or output filehandles being closed once C<anyinflate> has
completed.

This parameter defaults to 0.

=item C<< BinModeOut => 0|1 >>

When writing to a file or filehandle, set C<binmode> before writing to the
file.

Defaults to 0.

=item C<< Append => 0|1 >>

The behaviour of this option is dependent on the type of output data
stream.

=over 5

=item * A Buffer

If C<Append> is enabled, all uncompressed data will be append to the end of
the output buffer. Otherwise the output buffer will be cleared before any
uncompressed data is written to it.

=item * A Filename

If C<Append> is enabled, the file will be opened in append mode. Otherwise
the contents of the file, if any, will be truncated before any uncompressed
data is written to it.

=item * A Filehandle

If C<Append> is enabled, the filehandle will be positioned to the end of
the file via a call to C<seek> before any uncompressed data is
written to it.  Otherwise the file pointer will not be moved.

=back

When C<Append> is specified, and set to true, it will I<append> all uncompressed 
data to the output data stream.

So when the output is a filehandle it will carry out a seek to the eof
before writing any uncompressed data. If the output is a filename, it will be opened for
appending. If the output is a buffer, all uncompressed data will be
appended to the existing buffer.

Conversely when C<Append> is not specified, or it is present and is set to
false, it will operate as follows.

When the output is a filename, it will truncate the contents of the file
before writing any uncompressed data. If the output is a filehandle
its position will not be changed. If the output is a buffer, it will be
wiped before any uncompressed data is output.

Defaults to 0.

=item C<< MultiStream => 0|1 >>

If the input file/buffer contains multiple compressed data streams, this
option will uncompress the whole lot as a single data stream.

Defaults to 0.

=item C<< TrailingData => $scalar >>

Returns the data, if any, that is present immediately after the compressed
data stream once uncompression is complete. 

This option can be used when there is useful information immediately
following the compressed data stream, and you don't know the length of the
compressed data stream.

If the input is a buffer, C<trailingData> will return everything from the
end of the compressed data stream to the end of the buffer.

If the input is a filehandle, C<trailingData> will return the data that is
left in the filehandle input buffer once the end of the compressed data
stream has been reached. You can then use the filehandle to read the rest
of the input file. 

Don't bother using C<trailingData> if the input is a filename.

If you know the length of the compressed data stream before you start
uncompressing, you can avoid having to use C<trailingData> by setting the
C<InputLength> option.

=back

=head2 Examples

To read the contents of the file C<file1.txt.Compressed> and write the
uncompressed data to the file C<file1.txt>.

    use strict ;
    use warnings ;
    use IO::Uncompress::AnyInflate qw(anyinflate $AnyInflateError) ;

    my $input = "file1.txt.Compressed";
    my $output = "file1.txt";
    anyinflate $input => $output
        or die "anyinflate failed: $AnyInflateError\n";

To read from an existing Perl filehandle, C<$input>, and write the
uncompressed data to a buffer, C<$buffer>.

    use strict ;
    use warnings ;
    use IO::Uncompress::AnyInflate qw(anyinflate $AnyInflateError) ;
    use IO::File ;

    my $input = new IO::File "<file1.txt.Compressed"
        or die "Cannot open 'file1.txt.Compressed': $!\n" ;
    my $buffer ;
    anyinflate $input => \$buffer 
        or die "anyinflate failed: $AnyInflateError\n";

To uncompress all files in the directory "/my/home" that match "*.txt.Compressed" and store the compressed data in the same directory

    use strict ;
    use warnings ;
    use IO::Uncompress::AnyInflate qw(anyinflate $AnyInflateError) ;

    anyinflate '</my/home/*.txt.Compressed>' => '</my/home/#1.txt>'
        or die "anyinflate failed: $AnyInflateError\n";

and if you want to compress each file one at a time, this will do the trick

    use strict ;
    use warnings ;
    use IO::Uncompress::AnyInflate qw(anyinflate $AnyInflateError) ;

    for my $input ( glob "/my/home/*.txt.Compressed" )
    {
        my $output = $input;
        $output =~ s/.Compressed// ;
        anyinflate $input => $output 
            or die "Error compressing '$input': $AnyInflateError\n";
    }

=head1 OO Interface

=head2 Constructor

The format of the constructor for IO::Uncompress::AnyInflate is shown below

    my $z = new IO::Uncompress::AnyInflate $input [OPTS]
        or die "IO::Uncompress::AnyInflate failed: $AnyInflateError\n";

Returns an C<IO::Uncompress::AnyInflate> object on success and undef on failure.
The variable C<$AnyInflateError> will contain an error message on failure.

If you are running Perl 5.005 or better the object, C<$z>, returned from
IO::Uncompress::AnyInflate can be used exactly like an L<IO::File|IO::File> filehandle.
This means that all normal input file operations can be carried out with
C<$z>.  For example, to read a line from a compressed file/buffer you can
use either of these forms

    $line = $z->getline();
    $line = <$z>;

The mandatory parameter C<$input> is used to determine the source of the
compressed data. This parameter can take one of three forms.

=over 5

=item A filename

If the C<$input> parameter is a scalar, it is assumed to be a filename. This
file will be opened for reading and the compressed data will be read from it.

=item A filehandle

If the C<$input> parameter is a filehandle, the compressed data will be
read from it.
The string '-' can be used as an alias for standard input.

=item A scalar reference 

If C<$input> is a scalar reference, the compressed data will be read from
C<$$input>.

=back

=head2 Constructor Options

The option names defined below are case insensitive and can be optionally
prefixed by a '-'.  So all of the following are valid

    -AutoClose
    -autoclose
    AUTOCLOSE
    autoclose

OPTS is a combination of the following options:

=over 5

=item C<< AutoClose => 0|1 >>

This option is only valid when the C<$input> parameter is a filehandle. If
specified, and the value is true, it will result in the file being closed once
either the C<close> method is called or the IO::Uncompress::AnyInflate object is
destroyed.

This parameter defaults to 0.

=item C<< MultiStream => 0|1 >>

Allows multiple concatenated compressed streams to be treated as a single
compressed stream. Decompression will stop once either the end of the
file/buffer is reached, an error is encountered (premature eof, corrupt
compressed data) or the end of a stream is not immediately followed by the
start of another stream.

This parameter defaults to 0.

=item C<< Prime => $string >>

This option will uncompress the contents of C<$string> before processing the
input file/buffer.

This option can be useful when the compressed data is embedded in another
file/data structure and it is not possible to work out where the compressed
data begins without having to read the first few bytes. If this is the
case, the uncompression can be I<primed> with these bytes using this
option.

=item C<< Transparent => 0|1 >>

If this option is set and the input file/buffer is not compressed data,
the module will allow reading of it anyway.

In addition, if the input file/buffer does contain compressed data and
there is non-compressed data immediately following it, setting this option
will make this module treat the whole file/buffer as a single data stream.

This option defaults to 1.

=item C<< BlockSize => $num >>

When reading the compressed input data, IO::Uncompress::AnyInflate will read it in
blocks of C<$num> bytes.

This option defaults to 4096.

=item C<< InputLength => $size >>

When present this option will limit the number of compressed bytes read
from the input file/buffer to C<$size>. This option can be used in the
situation where there is useful data directly after the compressed data
stream and you know beforehand the exact length of the compressed data
stream. 

This option is mostly used when reading from a filehandle, in which case
the file pointer will be left pointing to the first byte directly after the
compressed data stream.

This option defaults to off.

=item C<< Append => 0|1 >>

This option controls what the C<read> method does with uncompressed data.

If set to 1, all uncompressed data will be appended to the output parameter
of the C<read> method.

If set to 0, the contents of the output parameter of the C<read> method
will be overwritten by the uncompressed data.

Defaults to 0.

=item C<< Strict => 0|1 >>

This option controls whether the extra checks defined below are used when
carrying out the decompression. When Strict is on, the extra tests are
carried out, when Strict is off they are not.

The default for this option is off.

If the input is an RFC 1950 data stream, the following will be checked:

=over 5

=item 1

The ADLER32 checksum field must be present.

=item 2

The value of the ADLER32 field read must match the adler32 value of the
uncompressed data actually contained in the file.

=back

If the input is a gzip (RFC 1952) data stream, the following will be checked:

=over 5

=item 1 

If the FHCRC bit is set in the gzip FLG header byte, the CRC16 bytes in the
header must match the crc16 value of the gzip header actually read.

=item 2

If the gzip header contains a name field (FNAME) it consists solely of ISO
8859-1 characters.

=item 3

If the gzip header contains a comment field (FCOMMENT) it consists solely
of ISO 8859-1 characters plus line-feed.

=item 4

If the gzip FEXTRA header field is present it must conform to the sub-field
structure as defined in RFC 1952.

=item 5

The CRC32 and ISIZE trailer fields must be present.

=item 6

The value of the CRC32 field read must match the crc32 value of the
uncompressed data actually contained in the gzip file.

=item 7

The value of the ISIZE fields read must match the length of the
uncompressed data actually read from the file.

=back

=item C<< RawInflate => 0|1 >>

When auto-detecting the compressed format, try to test for raw-deflate (RFC
1951) content using the C<IO::Uncompress::RawInflate> module. 

The reason this is not default behaviour is because RFC 1951 content can
only be detected by attempting to uncompress it. This process is error
prone and can result is false positives.

Defaults to 0.

=item C<< ParseExtra => 0|1 >>
If the gzip FEXTRA header field is present and this option is set, it will
force the module to check that it conforms to the sub-field structure as
defined in RFC 1952.

If the C<Strict> is on it will automatically enable this option.

Defaults to 0.

=head2 Examples

TODO

=head1 Methods 

=head2 read

Usage is

    $status = $z->read($buffer)

Reads a block of compressed data (the size of the compressed block is
determined by the C<Buffer> option in the constructor), uncompresses it and
writes any uncompressed data into C<$buffer>. If the C<Append> parameter is
set in the constructor, the uncompressed data will be appended to the
C<$buffer> parameter. Otherwise C<$buffer> will be overwritten.

Returns the number of uncompressed bytes written to C<$buffer>, zero if eof
or a negative number on error.

=head2 read

Usage is

    $status = $z->read($buffer, $length)
    $status = $z->read($buffer, $length, $offset)

    $status = read($z, $buffer, $length)
    $status = read($z, $buffer, $length, $offset)

Attempt to read C<$length> bytes of uncompressed data into C<$buffer>.

The main difference between this form of the C<read> method and the
previous one, is that this one will attempt to return I<exactly> C<$length>
bytes. The only circumstances that this function will not is if end-of-file
or an IO error is encountered.

Returns the number of uncompressed bytes written to C<$buffer>, zero if eof
or a negative number on error.

=head2 getline

Usage is

    $line = $z->getline()
    $line = <$z>

Reads a single line. 

This method fully supports the use of the variable C<$/> (or
C<$INPUT_RECORD_SEPARATOR> or C<$RS> when C<English> is in use) to
determine what constitutes an end of line. Paragraph mode, record mode and
file slurp mode are all supported. 

=head2 getc

Usage is 

    $char = $z->getc()

Read a single character.

=head2 ungetc

Usage is

    $char = $z->ungetc($string)

=head2 inflateSync

Usage is

    $status = $z->inflateSync()

TODO

=head2 getHeaderInfo

Usage is

    $hdr  = $z->getHeaderInfo();
    @hdrs = $z->getHeaderInfo();

This method returns either a hash reference (in scalar context) or a list
or hash references (in array context) that contains information about each
of the header fields in the compressed data stream(s).

=head2 tell

Usage is

    $z->tell()
    tell $z

Returns the uncompressed file offset.

=head2 eof

Usage is

    $z->eof();
    eof($z);

Returns true if the end of the compressed input stream has been reached.

=head2 seek

    $z->seek($position, $whence);
    seek($z, $position, $whence);

Provides a sub-set of the C<seek> functionality, with the restriction
that it is only legal to seek forward in the input file/buffer.
It is a fatal error to attempt to seek backward.

Note that the implementation of C<seek> in this module does not provide
true random access to a compressed file/buffer. It  works by uncompressing
data from the current offset in the file/buffer until it reaches the
uncompressed offset specified in the parameters to C<seek>. For very small
files this may be acceptable behaviour. For large files it may cause an
unacceptable delay.

The C<$whence> parameter takes one the usual values, namely SEEK_SET,
SEEK_CUR or SEEK_END.

Returns 1 on success, 0 on failure.

=head2 binmode

Usage is

    $z->binmode
    binmode $z ;

This is a noop provided for completeness.

=head2 opened

    $z->opened()

Returns true if the object currently refers to a opened file/buffer. 

=head2 autoflush

    my $prev = $z->autoflush()
    my $prev = $z->autoflush(EXPR)

If the C<$z> object is associated with a file or a filehandle, this method
returns the current autoflush setting for the underlying filehandle. If
C<EXPR> is present, and is non-zero, it will enable flushing after every
write/print operation.

If C<$z> is associated with a buffer, this method has no effect and always
returns C<undef>.

B<Note> that the special variable C<$|> B<cannot> be used to set or
retrieve the autoflush setting.

=head2 input_line_number

    $z->input_line_number()
    $z->input_line_number(EXPR)

Returns the current uncompressed line number. If C<EXPR> is present it has
the effect of setting the line number. Note that setting the line number
does not change the current position within the file/buffer being read.

The contents of C<$/> are used to determine what constitutes a line
terminator.

=head2 fileno

    $z->fileno()
    fileno($z)

If the C<$z> object is associated with a file or a filehandle, C<fileno>
will return the underlying file descriptor. Once the C<close> method is
called C<fileno> will return C<undef>.

If the C<$z> object is associated with a buffer, this method will return
C<undef>.

=head2 close

    $z->close() ;
    close $z ;

Closes the output file/buffer. 

For most versions of Perl this method will be automatically invoked if
the IO::Uncompress::AnyInflate object is destroyed (either explicitly or by the
variable with the reference to the object going out of scope). The
exceptions are Perl versions 5.005 through 5.00504 and 5.8.0. In
these cases, the C<close> method will be called automatically, but
not until global destruction of all live objects when the program is
terminating.

Therefore, if you want your scripts to be able to run on all versions
of Perl, you should call C<close> explicitly and not rely on automatic
closing.

Returns true on success, otherwise 0.

If the C<AutoClose> option has been enabled when the IO::Uncompress::AnyInflate
object was created, and the object is associated with a file, the
underlying file will also be closed.

=head2 nextStream

Usage is

    my $status = $z->nextStream();

Skips to the next compressed data stream in the input file/buffer. If a new
compressed data stream is found, the eof marker will be cleared and C<$.>
will be reset to 0.

Returns 1 if a new stream was found, 0 if none was found, and -1 if an
error was encountered.

=head2 trailingData

Usage is

    my $data = $z->trailingData();

Returns the data, if any, that is present immediately after the compressed
data stream once uncompression is complete. It only makes sense to call
this method once the end of the compressed data stream has been
encountered.

This option can be used when there is useful information immediately
following the compressed data stream, and you don't know the length of the
compressed data stream.

If the input is a buffer, C<trailingData> will return everything from the
end of the compressed data stream to the end of the buffer.

If the input is a filehandle, C<trailingData> will return the data that is
left in the filehandle input buffer once the end of the compressed data
stream has been reached. You can then use the filehandle to read the rest
of the input file. 

Don't bother using C<trailingData> if the input is a filename.

If you know the length of the compressed data stream before you start
uncompressing, you can avoid having to use C<trailingData> by setting the
C<InputLength> option in the constructor.

=head1 Importing 

No symbolic constants are required by this IO::Uncompress::AnyInflate at present. 

=over 5

=item :all

Imports C<anyinflate> and C<$AnyInflateError>.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module provides a Perl interface that allows the reading of
bzip2 files/buffers.

For writing bzip2 files/buffers, see the companion module IO::Compress::Bzip2.

=head1 Functional Interface

A top-level function, C<bunzip2>, is provided to carry out
"one-shot" uncompression between buffers and/or files. For finer
control over the uncompression process, see the L</"OO Interface">
section.

    use IO::Uncompress::Bunzip2 qw(bunzip2 $Bunzip2Error) ;

    bunzip2 $input_filename_or_reference => $output_filename_or_reference [,OPTS] 
        or die "bunzip2 failed: $Bunzip2Error\n";

The functional interface needs Perl5.005 or better.

=head2 bunzip2 $input_filename_or_reference => $output_filename_or_reference [, OPTS]

C<bunzip2> expects at least two parameters,
C<$input_filename_or_reference> and C<$output_filename_or_reference>.

=head3 The C<$input_filename_or_reference> parameter

The parameter, C<$input_filename_or_reference>, is used to define the
source of the compressed data. 

It can take one of the following forms:

=over 5

=item A filename

If the <$input_filename_or_reference> parameter is a simple scalar, it is
assumed to be a filename. This file will be opened for reading and the
input data will be read from it.

=item A filehandle

If the C<$input_filename_or_reference> parameter is a filehandle, the input
data will be read from it.  The string '-' can be used as an alias for
standard input.

=item A scalar reference 

If C<$input_filename_or_reference> is a scalar reference, the input data
will be read from C<$$input_filename_or_reference>.

=item An array reference 

If C<$input_filename_or_reference> is an array reference, each element in
the array must be a filename.

The input data will be read from each file in turn. 

The complete array will be walked to ensure that it only
contains valid filenames before any data is uncompressed.

=item An Input FileGlob string

If C<$input_filename_or_reference> is a string that is delimited by the
characters "<" and ">" C<bunzip2> will assume that it is an 
I<input fileglob string>. The input is the list of files that match the 
fileglob.

See L<File::GlobMapper|File::GlobMapper> for more details.

=back

If the C<$input_filename_or_reference> parameter is any other type,
C<undef> will be returned.

=head3 The C<$output_filename_or_reference> parameter

The parameter C<$output_filename_or_reference> is used to control the
destination of the uncompressed data. This parameter can take one of
these forms.

=over 5

=item A filename

If the C<$output_filename_or_reference> parameter is a simple scalar, it is
assumed to be a filename.  This file will be opened for writing and the 
uncompressed data will be written to it.

=item A filehandle

If the C<$output_filename_or_reference> parameter is a filehandle, the
uncompressed data will be written to it.  The string '-' can be used as
an alias for standard output.

=item A scalar reference 

If C<$output_filename_or_reference> is a scalar reference, the
uncompressed data will be stored in C<$$output_filename_or_reference>.

=item An Array Reference

If C<$output_filename_or_reference> is an array reference, 
the uncompressed data will be pushed onto the array.

=item An Output FileGlob

If C<$output_filename_or_reference> is a string that is delimited by the
characters "<" and ">" C<bunzip2> will assume that it is an
I<output fileglob string>. The output is the list of files that match the
fileglob.

When C<$output_filename_or_reference> is an fileglob string,
C<$input_filename_or_reference> must also be a fileglob string. Anything
else is an error.

See L<File::GlobMapper|File::GlobMapper> for more details.

=back

If the C<$output_filename_or_reference> parameter is any other type,
C<undef> will be returned.

=head2 Notes

When C<$input_filename_or_reference> maps to multiple compressed
files/buffers and C<$output_filename_or_reference> is
a single file/buffer, after uncompression C<$output_filename_or_reference> will contain a
concatenation of all the uncompressed data from each of the input
files/buffers.

=head2 Optional Parameters

Unless specified below, the optional parameters for C<bunzip2>,
C<OPTS>, are the same as those used with the OO interface defined in the
L</"Constructor Options"> section below.

=over 5

=item C<< AutoClose => 0|1 >>

This option applies to any input or output data streams to 
C<bunzip2> that are filehandles.

If C<AutoClose> is specified, and the value is true, it will result in all
input and/or output filehandles being closed once C<bunzip2> has
completed.

This parameter defaults to 0.

=item C<< BinModeOut => 0|1 >>

When writing to a file or filehandle, set C<binmode> before writing to the
file.

Defaults to 0.

=item C<< Append => 0|1 >>

The behaviour of this option is dependent on the type of output data
stream.

=over 5

=item * A Buffer

If C<Append> is enabled, all uncompressed data will be append to the end of
the output buffer. Otherwise the output buffer will be cleared before any
uncompressed data is written to it.

=item * A Filename

If C<Append> is enabled, the file will be opened in append mode. Otherwise
the contents of the file, if any, will be truncated before any uncompressed
data is written to it.

=item * A Filehandle

If C<Append> is enabled, the filehandle will be positioned to the end of
the file via a call to C<seek> before any uncompressed data is
written to it.  Otherwise the file pointer will not be moved.

=back

When C<Append> is specified, and set to true, it will I<append> all uncompressed 
data to the output data stream.

So when the output is a filehandle it will carry out a seek to the eof
before writing any uncompressed data. If the output is a filename, it will be opened for
appending. If the output is a buffer, all uncompressed data will be
appended to the existing buffer.

Conversely when C<Append> is not specified, or it is present and is set to
false, it will operate as follows.

When the output is a filename, it will truncate the contents of the file
before writing any uncompressed data. If the output is a filehandle
its position will not be changed. If the output is a buffer, it will be
wiped before any uncompressed data is output.

Defaults to 0.

=item C<< MultiStream => 0|1 >>

If the input file/buffer contains multiple compressed data streams, this
option will uncompress the whole lot as a single data stream.

Defaults to 0.

=item C<< TrailingData => $scalar >>

Returns the data, if any, that is present immediately after the compressed
data stream once uncompression is complete. 

This option can be used when there is useful information immediately
following the compressed data stream, and you don't know the length of the
compressed data stream.

If the input is a buffer, C<trailingData> will return everything from the
end of the compressed data stream to the end of the buffer.

If the input is a filehandle, C<trailingData> will return the data that is
left in the filehandle input buffer once the end of the compressed data
stream has been reached. You can then use the filehandle to read the rest
of the input file. 

Don't bother using C<trailingData> if the input is a filename.

If you know the length of the compressed data stream before you start
uncompressing, you can avoid having to use C<trailingData> by setting the
C<InputLength> option.

=back

=head2 Examples

To read the contents of the file C<file1.txt.bz2> and write the
uncompressed data to the file C<file1.txt>.

    use strict ;
    use warnings ;
    use IO::Uncompress::Bunzip2 qw(bunzip2 $Bunzip2Error) ;

    my $input = "file1.txt.bz2";
    my $output = "file1.txt";
    bunzip2 $input => $output
        or die "bunzip2 failed: $Bunzip2Error\n";

To read from an existing Perl filehandle, C<$input>, and write the
uncompressed data to a buffer, C<$buffer>.

    use strict ;
    use warnings ;
    use IO::Uncompress::Bunzip2 qw(bunzip2 $Bunzip2Error) ;
    use IO::File ;

    my $input = new IO::File "<file1.txt.bz2"
        or die "Cannot open 'file1.txt.bz2': $!\n" ;
    my $buffer ;
    bunzip2 $input => \$buffer 
        or die "bunzip2 failed: $Bunzip2Error\n";

To uncompress all files in the directory "/my/home" that match "*.txt.bz2" and store the compressed data in the same directory

    use strict ;
    use warnings ;
    use IO::Uncompress::Bunzip2 qw(bunzip2 $Bunzip2Error) ;

    bunzip2 '</my/home/*.txt.bz2>' => '</my/home/#1.txt>'
        or die "bunzip2 failed: $Bunzip2Error\n";

and if you want to compress each file one at a time, this will do the trick

    use strict ;
    use warnings ;
    use IO::Uncompress::Bunzip2 qw(bunzip2 $Bunzip2Error) ;

    for my $input ( glob "/my/home/*.txt.bz2" )
    {
        my $output = $input;
        $output =~ s/.bz2// ;
        bunzip2 $input => $output 
            or die "Error compressing '$input': $Bunzip2Error\n";
    }

=head1 OO Interface

=head2 Constructor

The format of the constructor for IO::Uncompress::Bunzip2 is shown below

    my $z = new IO::Uncompress::Bunzip2 $input [OPTS]
        or die "IO::Uncompress::Bunzip2 failed: $Bunzip2Error\n";

Returns an C<IO::Uncompress::Bunzip2> object on success and undef on failure.
The variable C<$Bunzip2Error> will contain an error message on failure.

If you are running Perl 5.005 or better the object, C<$z>, returned from
IO::Uncompress::Bunzip2 can be used exactly like an L<IO::File|IO::File> filehandle.
This means that all normal input file operations can be carried out with
C<$z>.  For example, to read a line from a compressed file/buffer you can
use either of these forms

    $line = $z->getline();
    $line = <$z>;

The mandatory parameter C<$input> is used to determine the source of the
compressed data. This parameter can take one of three forms.

=over 5

=item A filename

If the C<$input> parameter is a scalar, it is assumed to be a filename. This
file will be opened for reading and the compressed data will be read from it.

=item A filehandle

If the C<$input> parameter is a filehandle, the compressed data will be
read from it.
The string '-' can be used as an alias for standard input.

=item A scalar reference 

If C<$input> is a scalar reference, the compressed data will be read from
C<$$input>.

=back

=head2 Constructor Options

The option names defined below are case insensitive and can be optionally
prefixed by a '-'.  So all of the following are valid

    -AutoClose
    -autoclose
    AUTOCLOSE
    autoclose

OPTS is a combination of the following options:

=over 5

=item C<< AutoClose => 0|1 >>

This option is only valid when the C<$input> parameter is a filehandle. If
specified, and the value is true, it will result in the file being closed once
either the C<close> method is called or the IO::Uncompress::Bunzip2 object is
destroyed.

This parameter defaults to 0.

=item C<< MultiStream => 0|1 >>

Allows multiple concatenated compressed streams to be treated as a single
compressed stream. Decompression will stop once either the end of the
file/buffer is reached, an error is encountered (premature eof, corrupt
compressed data) or the end of a stream is not immediately followed by the
start of another stream.

This parameter defaults to 0.

=item C<< Prime => $string >>

This option will uncompress the contents of C<$string> before processing the
input file/buffer.

This option can be useful when the compressed data is embedded in another
file/data structure and it is not possible to work out where the compressed
data begins without having to read the first few bytes. If this is the
case, the uncompression can be I<primed> with these bytes using this
option.

=item C<< Transparent => 0|1 >>

If this option is set and the input file/buffer is not compressed data,
the module will allow reading of it anyway.

In addition, if the input file/buffer does contain compressed data and
there is non-compressed data immediately following it, setting this option
will make this module treat the whole file/buffer as a single data stream.

This option defaults to 1.

=item C<< BlockSize => $num >>

When reading the compressed input data, IO::Uncompress::Bunzip2 will read it in
blocks of C<$num> bytes.

This option defaults to 4096.

=item C<< InputLength => $size >>

When present this option will limit the number of compressed bytes read
from the input file/buffer to C<$size>. This option can be used in the
situation where there is useful data directly after the compressed data
stream and you know beforehand the exact length of the compressed data
stream. 

This option is mostly used when reading from a filehandle, in which case
the file pointer will be left pointing to the first byte directly after the
compressed data stream.

This option defaults to off.

=item C<< Append => 0|1 >>

This option controls what the C<read> method does with uncompressed data.

If set to 1, all uncompressed data will be appended to the output parameter
of the C<read> method.

If set to 0, the contents of the output parameter of the C<read> method
will be overwritten by the uncompressed data.

Defaults to 0.

=item C<< Strict => 0|1 >>

This option is a no-op.

=item C<< Small => 0|1 >>

When non-zero this options will make bzip2 use a decompression algorithm
that uses less memory at the expense of increasing the amount of time
taken for decompression. 

Default is 0.

=head1 Methods 

=head2 read

Usage is

    $status = $z->read($buffer)

Reads a block of compressed data (the size of the compressed block is
determined by the C<Buffer> option in the constructor), uncompresses it and
writes any uncompressed data into C<$buffer>. If the C<Append> parameter is
set in the constructor, the uncompressed data will be appended to the
C<$buffer> parameter. Otherwise C<$buffer> will be overwritten.

Returns the number of uncompressed bytes written to C<$buffer>, zero if eof
or a negative number on error.

=head2 read

Usage is

    $status = $z->read($buffer, $length)
    $status = $z->read($buffer, $length, $offset)

    $status = read($z, $buffer, $length)
    $status = read($z, $buffer, $length, $offset)

Attempt to read C<$length> bytes of uncompressed data into C<$buffer>.

The main difference between this form of the C<read> method and the
previous one, is that this one will attempt to return I<exactly> C<$length>
bytes. The only circumstances that this function will not is if end-of-file
or an IO error is encountered.

Returns the number of uncompressed bytes written to C<$buffer>, zero if eof
or a negative number on error.

=head2 getline

Usage is

    $line = $z->getline()
    $line = <$z>

Reads a single line. 

This method fully supports the use of the variable C<$/> (or
C<$INPUT_RECORD_SEPARATOR> or C<$RS> when C<English> is in use) to
determine what constitutes an end of line. Paragraph mode, record mode and
file slurp mode are all supported. 

=head2 getc

Usage is 

    $char = $z->getc()

Read a single character.

=head2 ungetc

Usage is

    $char = $z->ungetc($string)

=head2 getHeaderInfo

Usage is

    $hdr  = $z->getHeaderInfo();
    @hdrs = $z->getHeaderInfo();

This method returns either a hash reference (in scalar context) or a list
or hash references (in array context) that contains information about each
of the header fields in the compressed data stream(s).

=head2 tell

Usage is

    $z->tell()
    tell $z

Returns the uncompressed file offset.

=head2 eof

Usage is

    $z->eof();
    eof($z);

Returns true if the end of the compressed input stream has been reached.

=head2 seek

    $z->seek($position, $whence);
    seek($z, $position, $whence);

Provides a sub-set of the C<seek> functionality, with the restriction
that it is only legal to seek forward in the input file/buffer.
It is a fatal error to attempt to seek backward.

Note that the implementation of C<seek> in this module does not provide
true random access to a compressed file/buffer. It  works by uncompressing
data from the current offset in the file/buffer until it reaches the
uncompressed offset specified in the parameters to C<seek>. For very small
files this may be acceptable behaviour. For large files it may cause an
unacceptable delay.

The C<$whence> parameter takes one the usual values, namely SEEK_SET,
SEEK_CUR or SEEK_END.

Returns 1 on success, 0 on failure.

=head2 binmode

Usage is

    $z->binmode
    binmode $z ;

This is a noop provided for completeness.

=head2 opened

    $z->opened()

Returns true if the object currently refers to a opened file/buffer. 

=head2 autoflush

    my $prev = $z->autoflush()
    my $prev = $z->autoflush(EXPR)

If the C<$z> object is associated with a file or a filehandle, this method
returns the current autoflush setting for the underlying filehandle. If
C<EXPR> is present, and is non-zero, it will enable flushing after every
write/print operation.

If C<$z> is associated with a buffer, this method has no effect and always
returns C<undef>.

B<Note> that the special variable C<$|> B<cannot> be used to set or
retrieve the autoflush setting.

=head2 input_line_number

    $z->input_line_number()
    $z->input_line_number(EXPR)

Returns the current uncompressed line number. If C<EXPR> is present it has
the effect of setting the line number. Note that setting the line number
does not change the current position within the file/buffer being read.

The contents of C<$/> are used to determine what constitutes a line
terminator.

=head2 fileno

    $z->fileno()
    fileno($z)

If the C<$z> object is associated with a file or a filehandle, C<fileno>
will return the underlying file descriptor. Once the C<close> method is
called C<fileno> will return C<undef>.

If the C<$z> object is associated with a buffer, this method will return
C<undef>.

=head2 close

    $z->close() ;
    close $z ;

Closes the output file/buffer. 

For most versions of Perl this method will be automatically invoked if
the IO::Uncompress::Bunzip2 object is destroyed (either explicitly or by the
variable with the reference to the object going out of scope). The
exceptions are Perl versions 5.005 through 5.00504 and 5.8.0. In
these cases, the C<close> method will be called automatically, but
not until global destruction of all live objects when the program is
terminating.

Therefore, if you want your scripts to be able to run on all versions
of Perl, you should call C<close> explicitly and not rely on automatic
closing.

Returns true on success, otherwise 0.

If the C<AutoClose> option has been enabled when the IO::Uncompress::Bunzip2
object was created, and the object is associated with a file, the
underlying file will also be closed.

=head2 nextStream

Usage is

    my $status = $z->nextStream();

Skips to the next compressed data stream in the input file/buffer. If a new
compressed data stream is found, the eof marker will be cleared and C<$.>
will be reset to 0.

Returns 1 if a new stream was found, 0 if none was found, and -1 if an
error was encountered.

=head2 trailingData

Usage is

    my $data = $z->trailingData();

Returns the data, if any, that is present immediately after the compressed
data stream once uncompression is complete. It only makes sense to call
this method once the end of the compressed data stream has been
encountered.

This option can be used when there is useful information immediately
following the compressed data stream, and you don't know the length of the
compressed data stream.

If the input is a buffer, C<trailingData> will return everything from the
end of the compressed data stream to the end of the buffer.

If the input is a filehandle, C<trailingData> will return the data that is
left in the filehandle input buffer once the end of the compressed data
stream has been reached. You can then use the filehandle to read the rest
of the input file. 

Don't bother using C<trailingData> if the input is a filename.

If you know the length of the compressed data stream before you start
uncompressing, you can avoid having to use C<trailingData> by setting the
C<InputLength> option in the constructor.

generate_tokens(readline) is a generator that breaks a stream of
text into Python tokens.  It accepts a readline-like method which is called
repeatedly to get the next line of input (or "" for EOF).  It generates
5-tuples with these members:

    the token type (see token.py)
    the token (a string)
    the starting (row, column) indices of the token (a 2-tuple of ints)
    the ending (row, column) indices of the token (a 2-tuple of ints)
    the original line (string)

It is designed to match the working of the Python tokenizer exactly, except
that it produces COMMENT tokens for comments and gives type OP for all
operators

Older entry points
    tokenize_loop(readline, tokeneater)
    tokenize(readline, tokeneater=printtoken)
are the same, except instead of generating tokens, tokeneater is a callback
function to which the 5 fields described above are passed as 5 arguments,
each time a new token is found.s   Ka-Ping Yee <ping@lfw.org>s@   GvR, ESR, Tim Peters, Thomas Wouters, Fred Drake, Skip MontanaroiN(   t   BOM_UTF8t   lookup(   t   *i   (   t   tokeni    t   _t   tokenizet   generate_tokenst

    The tokenize() function accepts two parameters: one representing the
    input stream, and one providing an output mechanism for tokenize().

    The first parameter, readline, must be a callable object which provides
    the same interface as the readline() method of built-in file objects.
    Each call to the function should return one line of input as a string.

    The second parameter, tokeneater, must also be a callable object. It is
    called once for each token, with five arguments, corresponding to the
    tuples generated by generate_tokens().

    The detect_encoding() function is used to detect the encoding that should
    be used to decode a Python source file. It requires one argument, readline,
    in the same way as the tokenize() generator.

    It will call readline a maximum of twice, and return the encoding used
    (as a string) and a list of any lines (left as bytes) it has read
    in.

    It detects the encoding from the presence of a utf-8 bom or an encoding
    cookie as specified in pep-0263. If both a bom and a cookie are present, but
    disagree, a SyntaxError will be raised. If the encoding cookie is an invalid
    charset, raise a SyntaxError.  Note that if a utf-8 bom is found,
    'utf-8-sig' is returned.

    If no encoding is specified, then the default of 'utf-8' will be returned.

    Each element returned by the iterable must be a token sequence
    with at least two elements, a token number and token value.  If
    only two tokens are passed, the resulting output is poor.

    The generate_tokens() generator requires one argument, readline, which
    must be a callable object which provides the same interface as the
    readline() method of built-in file objects. Each call to the function
    should return one line of input as a string.  Alternately, readline
    can be a callable function terminating with StopIteration:
        readline = open(myfile).next    # Example of alternate readline

    The generator produces 5-tuples with these members: the token type; the
    token string; a 2-tuple (srow, scol) of ints specifying the row and
    column where the token begins in the source; a 2-tuple (erow, ecol) of
    ints specifying the row and column where the token ends in the source;
    and the line on which the token was found. The line passed is the
    logical line; continuation lines are included.

    appears amenable to building extensions with GCC.  Returns a tuple
    (status, details), where 'status' is one of the following constants:
      CONFIG_H_OK
        all is well, go ahead and compile
      CONFIG_H_NOTOK
        doesn't look good
      CONFIG_H_UNCERTAIN
        not sure -- unable to read pyconfig.h
    'details' is a human-readable string explaining the situation.

    Note there are two ways to conclude "OK": either 'sys.version' contains
    the string "GCC" (implying that this Python was built with GCC), or the
    installed "pyconfig.h" contains the string "__GNUC__".

    Both 'src' and 'dst' must be directory names.  If 'src' is not a
    directory, raise DistutilsFileError.  If 'dst' does not exist, it is
    created with 'mkpath()'.  The end result of the copy is that every
    file in 'src' is copied to 'dst', and directories under 'src' are
    recursively copied to 'dst'.  Return the list of files that were
    copied or might have been copied, using their output name.  The
    return value is unaffected by 'update' or 'dry_run': it is simply
    the list of all files under 'src', with the names changed to be
    under 'dst'.

    'preserve_mode' and 'preserve_times' are the same as for
    'copy_file'; note that they only apply to regular files, not to
    directories.  If 'preserve_symlinks' is true, symlinks will be
    copied as symlinks (on platforms that support them!); otherwise
    (the default), the destination of the symlink will be copied.
    'update' and 'verbose' are the same as for 'copy_file'.

Most of the work hiding behind 'setup'
    is really done within a Distribution instance, which farms the work out
    to the Distutils commands specified on the command line.

    Setup scripts will almost never instantiate Distribution directly,
    unless the 'setup()' function is totally inadequate to their needs.
    However, it is conceivable that a setup script might wish to subclass
    Distribution for some specialized purpose, and then pass the subclass
    to 'setup()' as the 'distclass' keyword argument.  If so, it is
    necessary to respect the expectations that 'setup' has of Distribution.
    See the code for 'setup()', in core.py, for details.

        on Windows/Mac; and setup.cfg in the current directory.

        The file in the user's home directory can be disabled with the

 S(   s  Parse the setup script's command line, taken from the
        'script_args' instance attribute (which defaults to 'sys.argv[1:]'
        -- see 'setup()' in core.py).  This list is first processed for
        "global options" -- options that set attributes of the Distribution
        instance.  Then, it is alternately scanned for Distutils commands
        and options for that command.  Each new command terminates the
        options for the previous command.  The allowed options for a
        command are determined by the 'user_options' attribute of the
        command class -- thus, we have to be able to load command classes
        in order to parse the command line.  Any error in that 'options'
        attribute raises DistutilsGetoptError; any error on the
        command-line raises DistutilsArgError.  If no Distutils commands
        were found on the command line, raises DistutilsArgError.  Return
        true if command-line was successfully parsed and we should carry
        on with executing commands; false if no errors but we shouldn't
        execute commands (currently, this only happens if user asks for
        help).

        ("distutils.command." + command) and fetch the command class from
        the module.  The loaded class is also stored in 'cmdclass'
        to speed future calls to 'get_command_class()'.

        returned by 'get_command_obj()': ie., initialized but not yet
        finalized.  This provides the opportunity to sneak option
        values in programmatically, overriding or supplementing
        user-supplied values from the config files and command line.
        You'll have to re-finalize the command object (by calling
        'finalize_options()' or 'ensure_finalized()') before using it for
        real.

        'command' should be a command name (string) or command object.  If
        'reinit_subcommands' is true, also reinitializes the command's
        sub-commands, as declared by the 'sub_commands' class attribute (if
        it has one).  See the "install" command for an example.  Only
        reinitializes the sub-commands that actually matter, ie. those
        whose test predicates return true.

        Returns the reinitialized command object.

    appears amenable to building extensions with GCC.  Returns a tuple
    (status, details), where 'status' is one of the following constants:
      CONFIG_H_OK
        all is well, go ahead and compile
      CONFIG_H_NOTOK
        doesn't look good
      CONFIG_H_UNCERTAIN

    'details' is a human-readable string explaining the situation.

    Note there are two ways to conclude "OK": either 'sys.version' contains
    the string "GCC" (implying that this Python was built with GCC), or the
    installed "pyconfig.h" contains the string "__GNUC__".

Provides exceptions used by the Distutils modules.  Note that Distutils
modules may raise standard exceptions; in particular, SystemExit is
usually raised for errors that are obviously the end-user's fault
(eg. bad command-line arguments).

This module is safe to use in "from ... import *" mode; it only exports
symbols whose names start with "Distutils" and end with "Error".s   $Id$t   DistutilsErrorc           B   s   e  Z d  Z RS(   s   The root of all Distutils evil.(   t   __name__t

    module and everything needed to build it (hopefully in a portable
    way, but there are hooks that let you be as unportable as you need).

    Instance attributes:
      name : string
        the full name of the extension, including any packages -- ie.
        *not* a filename or pathname, but Python dotted name
      sources : [string]
        list of source filenames, relative to the distribution root
        (where the setup script lives), in Unix form (slash-separated)
        for portability.  Source files may be C, C++, SWIG (.i),
        platform-specific resource files, or whatever else is recognized
        by the "build_ext" command as source for a Python extension.
      include_dirs : [string]
        list of directories to search for C/C++ header files (in Unix
        form for portability)
      define_macros : [(name : string, value : string|None)]
        list of macros to define; each macro is defined using a 2-tuple,
        where 'value' is either the string to define it to or None to
        define it without a particular value (equivalent of "#define
        FOO" in source or -DFOO on Unix C compiler command line)
      undef_macros : [string]
        list of macros to undefine explicitly
      library_dirs : [string]
        list of directories to search for C/C++ libraries at link time
      libraries : [string]
        list of library names (not filenames or paths) to link against
      runtime_library_dirs : [string]
        list of directories to search for C/C++ libraries at run time
        (for shared extensions, this is when the extension is loaded)
      extra_objects : [string]
        list of extra files to link with (eg. object files not implied
        by 'sources', static library that must be explicitly specified,
        binary resource files, etc.)
      extra_compile_args : [string]
        any extra platform- and compiler-specific information to use
        when compiling the source files in 'sources'.  For platforms and
        compilers where "command line" makes sense, this is typically a
        list of command-line arguments, but for other platforms it could
        be anything.
      extra_link_args : [string]
        any extra platform- and compiler-specific information to use
        when linking object files together to create the extension (or
        to create a new static Python interpreter).  Similar
        interpretation as for 'extra_compile_args'.
      export_symbols : [string]
        list of symbols to be exported from a shared extension.  Not
        used on all platforms, and not generally necessary for Python
        extensions, which typically export exactly one symbol: "init" +
        extension_name.
      swig_opts : [string]
        any extra options to pass to SWIG if a source file has the .i
        extension.
      depends : [string]
        list of files that the extension depends on
      language : string
        extension language (i.e. "c", "c++", "objc"). Will be detected
        from the source extensions if not provided.

Wrapper around the standard getopt module that provides the following
additional features:
  * short and long options are tied together
  * options have help strings, so fancy_getopt could potentially
    create a complete usage summary
  * options set attributes of a passed-in object

    If 'dst' is a directory, then 'src' is copied there with the same name;
    otherwise, it must be a filename.  (If the file exists, it will be
    ruthlessly clobbered.)  If 'preserve_mode' is true (the default),
    the file's mode (type and permission bits, or whatever is analogous on
    the current platform) is copied.  If 'preserve_times' is true (the
    default), the last-modified and last-access times are copied as well.
    If 'update' is true, 'src' will only be copied if 'dst' does not exist,
    or if 'dst' does exist but is older than 'src'.

    'link' allows you to make hard links (os.link) or symbolic links
    (os.symlink) instead of copying: set it to "hard" or "sym"; if it is
    None (the default), files are copied.  Don't set 'link' on systems that
    don't support it: 'copy_file()' doesn't check if hard or symbolic
    linking is available. If hardlink fails, falls back to
    _copy_file_contents().

    Under Mac OS, uses the native file copy function in macostools; on
    other systems, uses '_copy_file_contents()' to copy file contents.

    Return a tuple (dest_name, copied): 'dest_name' is the actual name of
    the output file, and 'copied' is true if the file was copied (or would
    have been copied, if 'dry_run' true).

        match 'pattern', a Unix-style wildcard (glob) pattern.

        Patterns are not quite the same as implemented by the 'fnmatch'
        module: '*' and '?'  match non-special characters, where "special"
        is platform-dependent: slash on Unix; colon, slash, and backslash on
        DOS/Windows; and colon on Mac OS.

        If 'anchor' is true (the default), then the pattern match is more
        stringent: "*.py" will match "foo.py" but not "foo/bar.py".  If
        'anchor' is false, both of these will match.

        If 'prefix' is supplied, then only filenames starting with 'prefix'
        (itself a pattern) and ending with 'pattern', with anything in between
        them, will match.  'anchor' is ignored in this case.

        If 'is_regex' is true, 'anchor' and 'prefix' are ignored, and
        'pattern' is assumed to be either a string containing a regex or a
        regex object -- no translation is done, the regex is just compiled
        and used as-is.

        Selected strings will be added to self.files.

        Return 1 if files are found.

        Tries to find the program in several places: first, one of the

        absolute path that is known to exist.  If none of them work, just
        return the original program name, 'exe'.

    'cmd' is just the argument list for the new process, ie.
    cmd[0] is the program to run and cmd[1:] are the rest of its arguments.
    There is no way to run a program with a name different from that of its
    executable.

    If 'search_path' is true (the default), the system's executable
    search path will be used to find the program; otherwise, cmd[0]
    must be the exact path to the executable.  If 'dry_run' is true,
    the command will not actually be run.

    Raise DistutilsExecError if running the program fails in any way; just
    return on success.

Contains the UnixCCompiler class, a subclass of CCompiler that handles
the "typical" Unix-style command-line C compiler:
  * macros defined with -Dname[=value]
  * macros undefined with -Uname
  * include search directories specified with -Idir
  * libraries specified with -lllib
  * library search directories specified with -Ldir
  * compile handled by 'cc' (or similar) executable with -c option:
    compiles .c to .o
  * link static library handled by 'ar' command (possibly with 'ranlib')
  * link shared library handled by 'cc -shared'

get_config_var(name), and the list of variables is available via
get_config_vars().keys().  Additional convenience functions are also
available.

that (optionally) takes care of stripping comments, ignoring blank
lines, and joining lines with backslashes.s   $Id$iNt   TextFilec           B   s   e  Z d  Z i d d 6d d 6d d 6d d 6d d 6d d 6Z d d d	  Z d

 d   Z d   Z d   Z RS(   s  Provides a file-like object that takes care of all the things you
       commonly want to do when processing a text file that has some
       line-by-line syntax: strip comments (as long as "#" is your
       comment character), skip blank lines, join adjacent lines by
       escaping the newline (ie. backslash at end of line), strip
       leading and/or trailing whitespace.  All of these are optional
       and independently controllable.

       Provides a 'warn()' method so you can generate warning messages that
       report physical line number, even if the logical line in question
       spans multiple physical lines.  Also provides 'unreadline()' for
       implementing line-at-a-time lookahead.

       Constructor is called as:

           TextFile (filename=None, file=None, **options)

       It bombs (RuntimeError) if both 'filename' and 'file' are None;
       'filename' should be a string, and 'file' a file object (or
       something that provides 'readline()' and 'close()' methods).  It is
       recommended that you supply at least 'filename', so that TextFile
       can include it in warning messages.  If 'file' is not supplied,
       TextFile creates its own using the 'open()' builtin.

       The options are all boolean, and affect the value returned by
       'readline()':
         strip_comments [default: true]
           strip from "#" to end-of-line, as well as any whitespace
           leading up to the "#" -- unless it is escaped by a backslash
         lstrip_ws [default: false]
           strip leading whitespace from each line before returning it
         rstrip_ws [default: true]
           strip trailing whitespace (including line terminator!) from
           each line before returning it
         skip_blanks [default: true}
           skip lines that are empty *after* stripping comments and
           whitespace.  (If both lstrip_ws and rstrip_ws are false,
           then some lines may consist of solely whitespace: these will
           *not* be skipped, even if 'skip_blanks' is true.)
         join_lines [default: false]
           if a backslash is the last non-newline character on a line
           after stripping comments and whitespace, join the following line
           to it to form one "logical line"; if N consecutive lines end
           with a backslash, then N+1 physical lines will be joined to
           form one logical line.
         collapse_join [default: false]
           strip leading whitespace from lines that are joined to their
           predecessor; only matters if (join_lines and not lstrip_ws)

       Note that since 'rstrip_ws' can strip the trailing newline, the
       semantics of 'readline()' must differ from those of the builtin file
       object's 'readline()' method!  In particular, 'readline()' returns
       None for end-of-file: an empty string might just be a blank line (or
       an all-whitespace line), if 'rstrip_ws' is true but 'skip_blanks' is
       not.i   t   strip_commentst   skip_blanksi    t	   lstrip_wst	   rstrip_wst

           from an internal buffer if lines have previously been "unread"
           with 'unreadline()').  If the 'join_lines' option is true, this
           may involve reading multiple physical lines concatenated into a
           single string.  Updates the current line number, so calling
           'warn()' after 'readline()' emits a warning about the physical
           line(s) just read.  Returns None on end-of-file, since the empty
           string can occur if 'rstrip_ws' is true but 'strip_blanks' is
           not.iR   t   #i    i   s   \s   

    mainly to distinguish platform-specific build directories and
    platform-specific built distributions.  Typically includes the OS name
    and version and the architecture (as supplied by 'os.uname()'),
    although the exact information included depends on the OS; eg. for IRIX
    the architecture isn't particularly important (IRIX only runs on SGI
    hardware), but for Linux the kernel version isn't particularly
    important.

    Examples of returned values:
       linux-i586
       linux-alpha (?)
       solaris-2.6-sun4u
       irix-5.3
       irix64-6.2

    Windows will return one of:
       win-amd64 (64bit Windows on AMD64 (aka x86_64, Intel64, EM64T, etc)
       win-ia64 (64bit Windows on Itanium)
       win32 (all others - specifically, sys.platform is returned)

    For other non-POSIX platforms, currently just returns 'sys.platform'.

    always supplied in Unix style, and have to be converted to the local

    ValueError on non-Unix-ish systems if 'pathname' either starts or

    two, which is tricky on DOS/Windows and Mac OS.

    spaces are not escaped by a backslash, or inside a quoted string.
    Single and double quotes are equivalent, and the quote characters can
    be backslash-escaped.  The backslash is stripped from any two-character
    escape sequence, leaving only the escaped character.  The quote
    characters are stripped from any quoted string.  Returns a list of

    or .pyo files in the same directory.  'py_files' is a list of files
    to compile; any files that don't end in ".py" are silently skipped.
    'optimize' must be one of the following:
      0 - don't optimize (generate .pyc)
      1 - normal optimization (like "python -O")
      2 - extra optimization (like "python -OO")
    If 'force' is true, all files are recompiled regardless of
    timestamps.

    The source filename encoded in each bytecode file defaults to the
    filenames listed in 'py_files'; you can modify these with 'prefix' and
    'basedir'.  'prefix' is a string that will be stripped off of each
    source filename, and 'base_dir' is a directory name that will be
    prepended (after 'prefix' is stripped).  You can supply either or both
    (or neither) of 'prefix' and 'base_dir', as you wish.

    If 'dry_run' is true, doesn't actually do anything that would
    affect the filesystem.

    Byte-compilation is either done directly in this interpreter process
    with the standard py_compile module, or indirectly by writing a
    temporary script and executing it.  Normally, you should let
    'byte_compile()' figure out to use direct compilation or not (see
    the source for details).  The 'direct' flag is used by the script
    generated in indirect mode; unless you know what you're doing, leave
    it set to None.

each style of version numbering).  There are currently two such classes
implemented: StrictVersion and LooseVersion.

Every version number class implements the following interface:
  * the 'parse' method takes a string and parses it to some internal
    representation; if the string is an invalid version number,
    'parse' raises a ValueError exception
  * the class constructor takes an optional string argument which,
    if supplied, is passed to 'parse'
  * __str__ reconstructs the string that was passed to 'parse' (or
    an equivalent string -- ie. one that will generate an equivalent
    version number instance)
  * __repr__ generates Python code to recreate the version number instance
  * __cmp__ compares the current instance with either another instance
    of the same class or a string (which will be parsed to an instance
    of the same class, thus must follow the same rules)

    Implements the standard interface for version number classes as
    described above.  A version number consists of two or three
    dot-separated numeric components, with an optional "pre-release" tag
    on the end.  The pre-release tag consists of the letter 'a' or 'b'
    followed by a number.  If the numeric components of two version
    numbers are equal, then one with a pre-release tag will always
    be deemed earlier (lesser) than one without.

    The following are valid version numbers (shown in the order that
    would be obtained by sorting according to the supplied cmp function):

        0.4       0.4.0  (these two are equivalent)
        0.4.1
        0.5a1
        0.5b3
        0.5
        0.9.6
        1.0
        1.0.4a3
        1.0.4b1
        1.0.4

    The following are examples of invalid version numbers:

        1
        2.7.2.2
        1.3.a4
        1.3pl1
        1.3c4

    The rationale for this version numbering system will be explained
    in the distutils documentation.

    In fact, there is no such thing as an invalid version number under
    this scheme; the rules for comparison are simple and predictable,
    but may not always give the results you want (for some definition
    of "want").

    >>> v = VersionPredicate('pyepat.abc (>1.0, <3333.3a1, !=1555.1b3)')

    The `name` attribute provides the full dotted name that is given::

    >>> v.name
    'pyepat.abc'

    The str() of a `VersionPredicate` provides a normalized
    human-readable version of the expression::

    >>> print v
    pyepat.abc (> 1.0, < 3333.3a1, != 1555.1b3)

    The `satisfied_by()` method can be used to determine with a given
    version number is included in the set described by the version
    restrictions::

    >>> v.satisfied_by('1.1')
    True
    >>> v.satisfied_by('1.4')
    True
    >>> v.satisfied_by('1.0')
    False
    >>> v.satisfied_by('4444.4')
    False
    >>> v.satisfied_by('1555.1b3')
    False

    `VersionPredicate` is flexible in accepting extra whitespace::

    >>> v = VersionPredicate(' pat( ==  0.1  )  ')
    >>> v.name
    'pat'
    >>> v.satisfied_by('0.1')
    True
    >>> v.satisfied_by('0.2')
    False

    If any version numbers passed in do not conform to the
    restrictions of `StrictVersion`, a `ValueError` is raised::

    >>> v = VersionPredicate('p1.p2.p3.p4(>=1.0, <=1.3a1, !=1.2zb3)')
    Traceback (most recent call last):
      ...
    ValueError: invalid version number '1.2zb3'

    It the module or package name given does not conform to what's
    allowed as a legal module or package name, `ValueError` is
    raised::

    >>> v = VersionPredicate('foo-bar')
    Traceback (most recent call last):
      ...
    ValueError: expected parenthesized list: '-bar'

    >>> v = VersionPredicate('foo bar (12.21)')
    Traceback (most recent call last):
      ...

The Python mapping of the Document Object Model is documented in the
Python Library Reference in the section on the xml.dom package.

This package contains the following modules:

minidom -- A simple implementation of the Level 1 DOM with namespace
           support added (based on the Level 2 specification) and other
           minor Level 2 functionality.

pulldom -- DOM builder supporting on-demand tree-building for selected
           subtrees of the document.
