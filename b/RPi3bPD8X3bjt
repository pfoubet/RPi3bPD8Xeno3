	The target allows you to create rules in the "mangle" table which alter
	the netfilter mark (nfmark) field associated with the packet.

	Prior to routing, the nfmark can influence the routing method (see

	  This can be used to turn a spare LED into a network activity LED,
	  which only flashes in response to FTP transfers, for example.  Or
	  you could have an LED which lights up for a minute or two every time
	  somebody connects to your machine via SSH.

	  You will need support for the "led" class to make this work.

	  To create an LED trigger for incoming SSH traffic:
	    iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 22 -j LED --led-trigger-id ssh --led-delay 1000

	  Then attach the new trigger to an LED on your system:

	  This is used to overcome criminally braindead ISPs or servers which
	  block ICMP Fragmentation Needed packets.  The symptoms of this
	  problem are that everything works fine from your Linux
	  firewall/router, but machines behind it can never exchange large
	  packets:
	        1) Web browsers connect, then hang with no data received.
	        2) Small mail works fine, but large emails hang.
	        3) ssh works fine, but scp hangs after initial handshaking.

	  Workaround: activate this option and add a rule to your firewall
	  configuration like:

	  iptables -A FORWARD -p tcp --tcp-flags SYN,RST SYN \

	---help---
	  IP Virtual Server support will let you build a high-performance
	  virtual server based on cluster of two or more real servers. This
	  option must be enabled for at least one of the clustered computers
	  that will take care of intercepting incoming connections to a
	  single IP address and scheduling them to real servers.

	  Three request dispatching techniques are implemented, they are
	  virtual server via NAT, virtual server via tunneling and virtual
	  server via direct routing. The several scheduling algorithms can
	  be used to choose which server the connection is directed to,
	  thus load balancing can be achieved among the servers.  For more
	  information and its administration program, please visit the
	  following URL: <http://www.linuxvirtualserver.org/>.

	  If you want to compile it in kernel, say Y. To compile it as a
	  module, choose M here. If unsure, say N.

	---help---
	  Say Y here if you want to get additional messages useful in
	  debugging the IP virtual server code. You can change the debug

config	IP_VS_TAB_BITS
	int "IPVS connection table size (the Nth power of 2)"
	range 8 20
	default 12
	---help---
	  The IPVS connection hash table uses the chaining scheme to handle
	  hash collisions. Using a big IPVS connection hash table will greatly
	  reduce conflicts when there are hundreds of thousands of connections
	  in the hash table.

	  Note the table size must be power of 2. The table size will be the
	  value of 2 to the your input number power. The number to choose is
	  from 8 to 20, the default number is 12, which means the table size
	  is 4096. Don't input the number too small, otherwise you will lose
	  performance on it. You can adapt the table size yourself, according
	  to your virtual server application. It is good to set the table size
	  not far less than the number of connections per second multiplying
	  average lasting time of connection in the table.  For example, your
	  virtual server gets 200 connections per second, the connection lasts
	  for 200 seconds in average in the connection table, the table size
	  should be not far less than 200x200, it is good to set the table
	  size 32768 (2**15).

	  Another note that each connection occupies 128 bytes effectively and
	  each hash entry uses 8 bytes, so you can estimate how much memory is
	  needed for your box.

	  You can overwrite this number setting conn_tab_bits module parameter
	  or by appending ip_vs.conn_tab_bits=? to the kernel command line
	  if IP VS was compiled built-in.

config	IP_VS_LBLC
	tristate "locality-based least-connection scheduling"
	---help---
	  The locality-based least-connection scheduling algorithm is for
	  destination IP load balancing. It is usually used in cache cluster.
	  This algorithm usually directs packet destined for an IP address to
	  its server if the server is alive and under load. If the server is
	  overloaded (its active connection numbers is larger than its weight)
	  and there is a server in its half load, then allocate the weighted
	  least-connection server to this IP address.

	  module, choose M here. If unsure, say N.

config  IP_VS_LBLCR

	---help---
	  The locality-based least-connection with replication scheduling
	  algorithm is also for destination IP load balancing. It is 
	  usually used in cache cluster. It differs from the LBLC scheduling
	  as follows: the load balancer maintains mappings from a target
	  to a set of server nodes that can serve the target. Requests for
	  a target are assigned to the least-connection node in the target's
	  server set. If all the node in the server set are over loaded,
	  it picks up a least-connection node in the cluster and adds it
	  in the sever set for the target. If the server set has not been
	  modified for the specified time, the most loaded node is removed
	  from the server set, in order to avoid high degree of replication.

config	IP_VS_SED
	tristate "shortest expected delay scheduling"
	---help---
	  The shortest expected delay scheduling algorithm assigns network
	  connections to the server with the shortest expected delay. The 
	  expected delay that the job will experience is (Ci + 1) / Ui if 
	  sent to the ith server, in which Ci is the number of connections
	  on the ith server and Ui is the fixed service rate (weight)
	  of the ith server.

	  module, choose M here. If unsure, say N.

config	IP_VS_NQ
	tristate "never queue scheduling"
	---help---
	  The never queue scheduling algorithm adopts a two-speed model.
	  When there is an idle server available, the job will be sent to
	  the idle server, instead of waiting for a fast one. When there
	  is no idle server available, the job will be sent to the server
	  that minimize its expected delay (The Shortest Expected Delay
	  scheduling algorithm).

	---help---
	  The source hashing scheduler maps source IPs to destinations
	  stored in a hash table. This table is tiled by each destination
	  until all slots in the table are filled. When using weights to
	  allow destinations to receive more connections, the table is
	  tiled an amount proportional to the weights specified. The table

	bool "Data Center Bridging support"
	default n
	---help---
	  This enables support for configuring Data Center Bridging (DCB)
	  features on DCB capable Ethernet adapters via rtnetlink.  Say 'Y'
	  if you have a DCB capable Ethernet adapter which supports this
	  interface and you are connected to a DCB capable switch.

	  DCB is a collection of Ethernet enhancements which allow DCB capable
	  NICs and switches to support network traffic with differing
	  requirements (highly reliable, no drops vs. best effort vs. low
	  latency) to co-exist on Ethernet.

	  DCB features include:
	    Enhanced Transmission Selection (aka Priority Grouping) - provides a
	      framework for assigning bandwidth guarantees to traffic classes.
	    Priority-based Flow Control (PFC) - a MAC control pause frame which
	      works at the granularity of the 802.1p priority instead of the
	      link (802.3x).

# RxRPC session sockets
#

config AF_RXRPC
	tristate "RxRPC session sockets"
	depends on INET
	select CRYPTO
	select KEYS
	help
	  Say Y or M here to include support for RxRPC session sockets (just
	  the transport part, not the presentation part: (un)marshalling is
	  left to the application).

	  These are used for AFS kernel filesystem and userspace utilities.

	  This module at the moment only supports client operations and is
	  currently incomplete.

	  See Documentation/networking/rxrpc.txt.


config AF_RXRPC_DEBUG
	bool "RxRPC dynamic debugging"
	depends on AF_RXRPC
	help
	  Say Y here to make runtime controllable debugging messages appear.

	  See Documentation/networking/rxrpc.txt.


config RXKAD
	tristate "RxRPC Kerberos security"
	depends on AF_RXRPC
	select CRYPTO
	select CRYPTO_MANAGER
	select CRYPTO_BLKCIPHER
	select CRYPTO_PCBC
	select CRYPTO_FCRYPT
	help
	  Provide kerberos 4 and AFS kaserver security handling for AF_RXRPC

	  Choose Y here to enable Secure RPC using the Kerberos version 5
	  GSS-API mechanism (RFC 1964).

	  Secure RPC calls with Kerberos require an auxiliary user-space
	  daemon which may be found in the Linux nfs-utils package
	  available from http://linux-nfs.org/.  In addition, user-space
	  Kerberos support should be installed.

	  If unsure, say Y.

	  This option enables a sysctl-based debugging interface
	  that is be used by the 'rpcdebug' utility to turn on or off
	  logging of different aspects of the kernel RPC activity.

	  Disabling this option will make your kernel slightly smaller,
	  but makes troubleshooting NFS issues significantly harder.

	---help---
	  Unless you really know what you are doing, you should say Y here.
	  The reason is that some programs need kernel networking support even
	  when running on a stand-alone machine that isn't connected to any
	  other computer.
	  
	  If you are upgrading from an older kernel, you
	  should consider updating your networking tools too because changes
	  in the kernel and the tools often go hand in hand. The tools are
	  contained in the package net-tools, the location and version number
	  of which are given in <file:Documentation/Changes>.

	  For a general introduction to Linux networking, it is highly
	  recommended to read the NET-HOWTO, available from
	  <http://www.tldp.org/docs.html#howto>.

	help
	  This option can be selected by other options that need compat
	  netlink messages.

config COMPAT_NETLINK_MESSAGES
	def_bool y
	depends on COMPAT
	depends on WEXT_CORE || WANT_COMPAT_NETLINK_MESSAGES
	help
	  This option makes it possible to send different netlink messages
	  to tasks depending on whether the task is a compat task or not. To
	  achieve this, you need to set skb_shinfo(skb)->frag_list to the
	  compat skb before sending the skb, the netlink code will sort out
	  which message to actually pass to the task.

	  Newly written code should NEVER need this option but do
	  compat-independent messages instead!

	---help---
	  These are the protocols used on the Internet and on most local
	  Ethernets. It is highly recommended to say Y here (this will enlarge
	  your kernel by about 400 KB), since some programs (e.g. the X window

	  other computer. You will get the so-called loopback device which
	  allows you to ping yourself (great fun, that!).

	  behavior of the TCP/IP code by writing to the (virtual) files in
	  /proc/sys/net/ipv4/*; the options are explained in the file

menuconfig NETFILTER
	bool "Network packet filtering framework (Netfilter)"
	---help---
	  Netfilter is a framework for filtering and mangling network packets
	  that pass through your Linux box.

	  The most common use of packet filtering is to run your Linux box as
	  a firewall protecting a local network from the Internet. The type of
	  firewall provided by this kernel support is called a "packet
	  filter", which means that it can reject individual network packets
	  based on type, source, destination etc. The other kind of firewall,
	  a "proxy-based" one, is more secure but more intrusive and more
	  bothersome to set up; it inspects the network traffic much more
	  closely, modifies it and has knowledge about the higher level
	  protocols, which a packet filter lacks. Moreover, proxy-based
	  firewalls often require changes to the programs running on the local
	  clients. Proxy-based firewalls don't need support by the kernel, but
	  they are often combined with a packet filter, which only works if
	  you say Y here.

	  You should also say Y here if you intend to use your Linux box as
	  the gateway to the Internet for a local network of machines without
	  globally valid IP addresses. This is called "masquerading": if one
	  of the computers on your local network wants to send something to
	  the outside, your box can "masquerade" as that computer, i.e. it
	  forwards the traffic to the intended outside destination, but
	  modifies the packets to make it look like they came from the
	  firewall box itself. It works both ways: if the outside host
	  replies, the Linux box will silently forward the traffic to the
	  correct local computer. This way, the computers on your local net
	  are completely invisible to the outside world, even though they can
	  reach the outside and can receive replies. It is even possible to
	  run globally visible servers from within a masqueraded local network
	  using a mechanism called portforwarding. Masquerading is also often
	  called NAT (Network Address Translation).

	  Another use of Netfilter is in transparent proxying: if a machine on
	  the local network tries to connect to an outside host, your Linux
	  box can transparently forward the traffic to a local server,
	  typically a caching proxy server.

	  Yet another use of Netfilter is building a bridging firewall. Using
	  a bridge with Network packet filtering enabled makes iptables "see"
	  the bridged traffic. For filtering on the lower network and Ethernet
	  protocols over the bridge, use ebtables (under bridge netfilter
	  configuration).

	  Various modules exist for netfilter which replace the previous
	  masquerading (ipmasqadm), packet filtering (ipchains), transparent
	  proxying, and portforwarding mechanisms. Please see
	  <file:Documentation/Changes> under "iptables" for the location of
	  these packages.

# Configuration for DNS Resolver
#
config DNS_RESOLVER
	tristate "DNS Resolver support"
	depends on NET && KEYS
	help
	  Saying Y here will include support for the DNS Resolver key type
	  which can be used to make upcalls to perform DNS lookups in
	  userspace.

	  DNS Resolver is used to query DNS server for information.  Examples
	  being resolving a UNC hostname element to an IP address for CIFS or
	  performing a DNS query for AFSDB records so that AFS can locate a
	  cell's volume location database servers.

	  DNS Resolver is used by the CIFS and AFS modules, and would support
	  SMB2 later.  DNS Resolver is supported by the userspace upcall
	  helper "/sbin/dns.resolver" via /etc/request-key.conf.

	  See <file:Documentation/networking/dns_resolver.txt> for further
	  information.

	  To compile this as a module, choose M here: the module will be called
