	  a priority higher than the lowest-priority thread that is
	  conspiring to prevent the CPU from running any non-real-time

	  e.g. backtraces.

	  The increased size means that a new buffer has to be allocated and
	  the original static one is unused. It makes sense only on systems
	  with more CPUs. Therefore this value is used only when the sum of
	  contributions is greater than the half of the default kernel ring
	  buffer as defined by LOG_BUF_SHIFT. The default values are set
	  so that more than 64 CPUs are needed to trigger the allocation.

	  Also this option is ignored when "log_buf_len" kernel parameter is

	  The number of possible CPUs is used for this computation ignoring
	  hotplugging making the compuation optimal for the the worst case

	   sections). This is sufficient for most cases. And only in very rare
	   cases (e.g., when a debugger is used) all symbols are required (e.g.,
	   names of variables from the data sections, etc).

	   This option makes sure that all symbols are loaded into the kernel
	   image (i.e., symbols from all sections) in cost of increased kernel
	   size (depending on the kernel configuration, it may be 300KiB or
	   something like this).

	 Unlike early_printk() console devices, raw_printk() devices
         can live past the boot sequence.

config BUG

          Disabling this option eliminates support for BUG and WARN, reducing

	  The shmem is an internal filesystem used to manage shared memory.
	  It is backed by swap and manages resource limits. It is also exported

	help
	  Enable kernel support for various performance events provided
	  by software and hardware.

	  Software events are supported either built-in or via the
	  use of generic tracepoints.

	  Most modern CPUs support performance events via performance
	  counter registers. These registers count the number of certain
	  types of hw events: such as instructions executed, cachemisses
	  suffered, or branches mis-predicted - without slowing down the
	  kernel or applications. These registers can also trigger interrupts
	  when a threshold number of events have passed - and can thus be
	  used to profile the code that runs on that CPU.

	  The Linux Performance Event subsystem provides an abstraction of
	  these software and hardware event capabilities, available via a
	  system call and used by the "perf" utility in tools/perf/. It
	  provides per task and per CPU counters, and it provides event
	  capabilities on top of those.

config SLUB_DEBUG

config COMPAT_BRK

	  Randomizing heap placement makes heap exploits harder, but it

	  This option changes the bootup default to heap randomization
	  disabled, and can be overridden at runtime by setting
	  /proc/sys/kernel/randomize_va_space to 2.

config MMAP_ALLOW_UNINITIALIZED

	help
	  Normally, and according to the Linux spec, anonymous memory obtained
	  from mmap() has it's contents cleared before it is passed to
	  userspace.  Enabling this config option allows you to request that
	  mmap() skip that if it is given an MAP_UNINITIALIZED flag, thus
	  providing a huge performance boost.  If this option is not enabled,
	  then the flag will be ignored.

	  This is taken advantage of by uClibc's malloc(), and also by
	  ELF-FDPIC binfmt's brk and stack allocator.

	  Because of the obvious security issues, this option should only be
	  enabled on embedded devices where you control what is run in
	  userspace.  Since that isn't generally a problem on no-MMU systems,
	  it is normally safe to say Y here.

	  See Documentation/nommu-mmap.txt for more information.

	  Kernel modules are small pieces of compiled code which can

	  tool to add (and sometimes remove) them.  If you say Y here,
	  many parts of the kernel can be built as modules (by
	  answering M instead of Y where indicated): this is most
	  useful for infrequently used options which are not required
	  for booting.  For more information, see the man pages for
	  modprobe, lsmod, modinfo, insmod and rmmod.

	  If you say Y here, you will need to run "make
	  modules_install" to put the modules under /lib/modules/
	  where modprobe can find them (you may need to be root to do
	  this).

config MODULE_UNLOAD

config MODULE_FORCE_UNLOAD
	bool "Forced module unloading"

	  This option allows you to force a module to unload, even if the

config MODVERSIONS

	  unsure, say N.

config MODULE_SRCVERSION_ALL

menuconfig FB
	tristate "Support for frame buffer devices"
	select FB_CMDLINE
	---help---
	  The frame buffer device provides an abstraction for the graphics
	  hardware. It represents the frame buffer of some video hardware and
	  allows application software to access the graphics hardware through
	  a well-defined interface, so the software doesn't need to know
	  anything about the low-level (hardware register) stuff.

	  Frame buffer devices work identically across the different
	  architectures supported by Linux and make the implementation of
	  application programs easier and more portable; at this point, an X
	  server exists which uses the frame buffer device exclusively.
	  On several non-X86 architectures, the frame buffer device is the
	  only way to use the graphics hardware.

	  The device is accessed through special device nodes, usually located
	  in the /dev directory, i.e. /dev/fb*.

	  You need an utility program called fbset to make full use of frame
	  buffer devices. Please read <file:Documentation/fb/framebuffer.txt>
	  and the Framebuffer-HOWTO at
	  <http://www.munted.org.uk/programming/Framebuffer-HOWTO-1.3.html> for more
	  information.

	  Say Y here and to the driver for your graphics board below if you
	  are compiling a kernel for a non-x86 architecture.

	  If you are compiling for the x86 architecture, you can say Y if you
	  want to play with it, but it is not essential. Please note that
	  running graphical applications that directly touch the hardware
	  (e.g. an accelerated X server) and that are not frame buffer
	  device-aware may cause unexpected results. If unsure, say N.

config FIRMWARE_EDID
       bool "Enable firmware EDID"
       depends on FB
       default n
       ---help---
         This enables access to the EDID transferred from the firmware.
	 On the i386, this is from the Video BIOS. Enable this if DDC/I2C
	 transfers do not work for your driver and if you are using
	 nvidiafb, i810fb or savagefb.

	 In general, choosing Y for this option is safe.  If you
	 experience extremely long delays while booting before you get
	 something on your display, try setting this to N.  Matrox cards in
	 combination with certain motherboards and monitors are known to
	 suffer from this problem.

          on this feature such as the radeonfb, rivafb, and the i810fb. If

       depends on FB

       ---help---
         This enables tile blitting.  Tile blitting is a drawing technique
	 where the screen is divided into rectangular sections (tiles), whereas
	 the standard blitting divides the screen into pixels. Because the
	 default drawing element is a tile, drawing functions will be passed
	 parameters in terms of number of tiles instead of number of pixels.
	 For example, to draw a single character, instead of using bitmaps,
	 an index to an array of bitmaps will be used.  To clear or move a
	 rectangular section of a screen, the rectangle will be described in
	 terms of number of tiles in the x- and y-axis.

	 This is particularly important to one driver, matroxfb.  If
	 unsure, say N.

$config_help{"MACHINE"} = << "EOF"
 The machine hostname that you will test.
 For build only tests, it is still needed to differentiate log files.
EOF
    ;
$config_help{"SSH_USER"} = << "EOF"
 The box is expected to have ssh on normal bootup, provide the user
  (most likely root, since you need privileged operations)
EOF
    ;
$config_help{"BUILD_DIR"} = << "EOF"
 The directory that contains the Linux source code (full path).
 You can use \${PWD} that will be the path where ktest.pl is run, or use
 \${THIS_DIR} which is assigned \${PWD} but may be changed later.
EOF
    ;
$config_help{"OUTPUT_DIR"} = << "EOF"
 The directory that the objects will be built (full path).
 (can not be same as BUILD_DIR)
 You can use \${PWD} that will be the path where ktest.pl is run, or use
 \${THIS_DIR} which is assigned \${PWD} but may be changed later.
EOF
    ;
$config_help{"BUILD_TARGET"} = << "EOF"
 The location of the compiled file to copy to the target.
 (relative to OUTPUT_DIR)
EOF
    ;
$config_help{"BUILD_OPTIONS"} = << "EOF"
 Options to add to \"make\" when building.
 i.e.  -j20
EOF
    ;
$config_help{"TARGET_IMAGE"} = << "EOF"
 The place to put your image on the test machine.
EOF
    ;
$config_help{"POWER_CYCLE"} = << "EOF"
 A script or command to reboot the box.

 Here is a digital loggers power switch example
 POWER_CYCLE = wget --no-proxy -O /dev/null -q  --auth-no-challenge 'http://admin:admin\@power/outlet?5=CCL'

 Here is an example to reboot a virtual box on the current host
 with the name "Guest".
 POWER_CYCLE = virsh destroy Guest; sleep 5; virsh start Guest
EOF
    ;
$config_help{"CONSOLE"} = << "EOF"
 The script or command that reads the console

  If you use ttywatch server, something like the following would work.
CONSOLE = nc -d localhost 3001

 For a virtual machine with guest name "Guest".
CONSOLE =  virsh console Guest
EOF
    ;
$config_help{"LOCALVERSION"} = << "EOF"
 Required version ending to differentiate the test
 from other linux builds on the system.
EOF
    ;
$config_help{"REBOOT_TYPE"} = << "EOF"
 Way to reboot the box to the test kernel.
 Only valid options so far are "grub", "grub2", "syslinux", and "script".

 If you specify grub, it will assume grub version 1
 and will search in /boot/grub/menu.lst for the title \$GRUB_MENU
 and select that target to reboot to the kernel. If this is not
 your setup, then specify "script" and have a command or script
 specified in REBOOT_SCRIPT to boot to the target.

 The entry in /boot/grub/menu.lst must be entered in manually.
 The test will not modify that file.

 If you specify grub2, then you also need to specify both \$GRUB_MENU
 and \$GRUB_FILE.

 If you specify syslinux, then you may use SYSLINUX to define the syslinux
 command (defaults to extlinux), and SYSLINUX_PATH to specify the path to
 the syslinux install (defaults to /boot/extlinux). But you have to specify
 SYSLINUX_LABEL to define the label to boot to for the test kernel.
EOF
    ;
$config_help{"GRUB_MENU"} = << "EOF"
 The grub title name for the test kernel to boot
 (Only mandatory if REBOOT_TYPE = grub or grub2)

 Note, ktest.pl will not update the grub menu.lst, you need to
 manually add an option for the test. ktest.pl will search
 the grub menu.lst for this option to find what kernel to
 reboot into.

 For example, if in the /boot/grub/menu.lst the test kernel title has:
 title Test Kernel
 kernel vmlinuz-test
 GRUB_MENU = Test Kernel

 For grub2, a search of \$GRUB_FILE is performed for the lines
 that begin with "menuentry". It will not detect submenus. The
 menu must be a non-nested menu. Add the quotes used in the menu
 to guarantee your selection, as the first menuentry with the content
 of \$GRUB_MENU that is found will be used.
EOF
    ;
$config_help{"GRUB_FILE"} = << "EOF"
 If grub2 is used, the full path for the grub.cfg file is placed
 here. Use something like /boot/grub2/grub.cfg to search.
EOF
    ;
$config_help{"SYSLINUX_LABEL"} = << "EOF"
 If syslinux is used, the label that boots the target kernel must
 be specified with SYSLINUX_LABEL.
EOF
    ;
$config_help{"REBOOT_SCRIPT"} = << "EOF"
 A script to reboot the target into the test kernel
 (Only mandatory if REBOOT_TYPE = script)
EOF

# 18/01/2001 - 	Cleanups
# 		Functions prototyped as foo(void) same as foo()
# 		Stop eval'ing where we don't need to.
# -- huggie@earth.li

# 27/06/2001 -  Allowed whitespace after initial "/**" and
#               allowed comments before function declarations.
# -- Christian Kreibich <ck@whoop.org>

# Still to do:
# 	- add perldoc documentation
# 	- Look more closely at some of the scarier bits :)

# 26/05/2001 - 	Support for separate source and object trees.
#		Return error code.
# 		Keith Owens <kaos@ocs.com.au>

# 23/09/2001 - Added support for typedefs, structs, enums and unions
#              Support for Context section; can be terminated using empty line
#              Small fixes (like spaces vs. \s in regex)
# -- Tim Jansen <tim@tjansen.de>

# 25/07/2012 - Added support for HTML5
# -- Dan Luedtke <mail@danrl.de>

#
# This will read a 'c' file and scan for embedded comments in the
# style of gnome comments (+minor extensions - see below).
#

# Note: This only supports 'c'.

# usage:
# kernel-doc [ -docbook | -html | -html5 | -text | -man | -list ]
#            [ -no-doc-sections ]
#            [ -function funcname [ -function funcname ...] ]
#            c file(s)s > outputfile
# or
#            [ -nofunction funcname [ -function funcname ...] ]
#            c file(s)s > outputfile
#
#  Set output format using one of -docbook -html -html5 -text or -man.
#  Default is man.
#  The -list format is for internal use by docproc.
#
#  -no-doc-sections
#	Do not output DOC: sections
#
#  -function funcname
#	If set, then only generate documentation for the given function(s) or
#	DOC: section titles.  All other functions and DOC: sections are ignored.
#
#  -nofunction funcname
#	If set, then only generate documentation for the other function(s)/DOC:
#	sections. Cannot be used together with -function (yes, that's a bug --
#	perl hackers can fix it 8))
#
#  c files - list of 'c' files to process
#
#  All output goes to stdout, with errors to stderr.

#
# format of comments.
# In the following table, (...)? signifies optional structure.
#                         (...)* signifies 0 or more structure elements
# /**
#  * function_name(:)? (- short description)?
# (* @parameterx: (description of parameter x)?)*
# (* a blank line)?
#  * (Description:)? (Description of function)?
#  * (section header: (section description)? )*
#  (*)?*/
#
# So .. the trivial example would be:
#
# /**
#  * my_function
#  */
#
# If the Description: header tag is omitted, then there must be a blank line
# after the last parameter specification.
# e.g.
# /**
#  * my_function - does my stuff
#  * @my_arg: its mine damnit
#  *
#  * Does my stuff explained.
#  */
#
#  or, could also use:
# /**
#  * my_function - does my stuff
#  * @my_arg: its mine damnit
#  * Description: Does my stuff explained.
#  */
# etc.
#
# Besides functions you can also write documentation for structs, unions,
# enums and typedefs. Instead of the function name you must write the name
# of the declaration;  the struct/union/enum/typedef must always precede
# the name. Nesting of declarations is not supported.
# Use the argument mechanism to document members or constants.
# e.g.
# /**
#  * struct my_struct - short description
#  * @a: first member
#  * @b: second member
#  *
#  * Longer description
#  */
# struct my_struct {
#     int a;
#     int b;
# /* private: */
#     int c;
# };
#
# All descriptions can be multiline, except the short function description.
#
# You can also add additional sections. When documenting kernel functions you
# should document the "Context:" of the function, e.g. whether the functions
# can be called form interrupts. Unlike other sections you can end it with an
# empty line.
# A non-void function should have a "Return:" section describing the return
# value(s).
# Example-sections should contain the string EXAMPLE so that they are marked
# appropriately in DocBook.
#
# Example:
# /**
#  * user_function - function that can only be called in user context
#  * @a: some argument
#  * Context: !in_interrupt()
#  *
#  * Some description
#  * Example:
#  *    user_function(22);
#  */
# ...
#
#
# All descriptive text is further processed, scanning for the following special
# patterns, which are highlighted appropriately.
#
# 'funcname()' - function
# '$ENVVAR' - environmental variable
# '&struct_name' - name of a structure (up to two words including 'struct')
# '@parameter' - name of a parameter
# '%CONST' - name of a constant.

 *   reader will always receive them before normal messages. @ref
 *   IPCPROTO_BUFP does not support out-of-band sending.
 *
 * - MSG_DONTWAIT Non-blocking I/O operation. The caller will not be
 *   blocked whenever the message cannot be sent immediately at the
 *   time of the call (e.g. memory shortage), but will rather return
 *   with -EWOULDBLOCK. Unlike other RTIPC protocols, @ref
 *   IPCPROTO_XDDP accepts but never considers MSG_DONTWAIT since
 *   writing to a real-time XDDP endpoint is inherently a non-blocking
 *   operation.
 *
 * - MSG_MORE Accumulate data before sending. This flag is accepted by
 *   the @ref IPCPROTO_XDDP protocol only, and tells the send service
 *   to accumulate the outgoing data into an internal streaming
 *   buffer, instead of issuing a datagram immediately for it. See

 * whichever comes first.
 *
 * Setting *@a optval to zero disables the streaming buffer, in which
 * case all sendings are conveyed in separate datagrams, regardless of
 * MSG_MORE.
 *
 * @note only a single streaming buffer exists per socket. When this
 * buffer is full, the real-time data stops accumulating and sending
 * operations resume in mere datagram mode. Accumulation may happen
 * again after some or all data in the streaming buffer is consumed
 * from the Linux domain endpoint.

 * - -EPROTONOSUPPORT (Protocol is not supported by the driver.
 *                     See @ref CAN_PROTO "CAN protocols"
 *                     for possible protocols.)

 * Specific return values: see @ref CANIOCTLs "below" @n
 * @n
 * @n
 * @anchor Bind
 * @b Bind @n
 * Binds a socket to one or all CAN devices (see struct sockaddr_can). If
 * a filter list has been defined with setsockopt (see @ref Sockopts),
 * it will be used upon reception of CAN frames to decide whether the
 * bound socket will receive a frame. If no filter has been defined, the
 * socket will receive @b all CAN frames on the specified interface(s). @n
 * @n
 * Binding to special interface index @c 0 will make the socket receive
 * CAN frames from all CAN interfaces. @n
 * @n
 * Binding to an interface index is also relevant for the @ref Send functions
 * because they will transmit a message over the interface the socket is
 * bound to when no socket address is given to them. @n
 * @n
 * @n
 * @coretags{secondary-only}
 * @n
 * Specific return values:
 * - -EFAULT (It was not possible to access user space memory area at the
 *            specified address.)
 * - -ENOMEM (Not enough memory to fulfill the operation)
 * - -EINVAL (Invalid address family, or invalid length of address structure)
 * - -ENODEV (Invalid CAN interface index)
 * - -ENOSPC (No enough space for filter list)
 * - -EBADF  (Socket is about to be closed)
 * - -EAGAIN (Too many receivers. Old binding (if any) is still active.
 *            Close some sockets and try again.)
 * .
 * @n
 * @n
 * @anchor Sockopts
 * <b>Setsockopt, Getsockopt</b>@n
 * These functions allow to set and get various socket options. Currently,
 * only CAN raw sockets are supported. @n
 * @n
 * Supported Levels and Options:
 * @n
 * - Level @b SOL_CAN_RAW : CAN RAW protocol (see @ref CAN_RAW)
 *   - Option @ref CAN_RAW_FILTER : CAN filter list
 *   - Option @ref CAN_RAW_ERR_FILTER : CAN error mask
 *   - Option @ref CAN_RAW_LOOPBACK : CAN TX loopback to local sockets
 *   .
 * .
 * @n
 * @coretags{task-unrestricted}
 * Specific return values: see links to options above. @n
 * @n
 * @n
 * @anchor Recv
 * <b>Recv, Recvfrom, Recvmsg</b> @n
 * These functions receive CAN messages from a socket. Only one
 * message per call can be received, so only one buffer with the correct length
 * must be passed. For @c SOCK_RAW, this is the size of struct can_frame. @n
 * @n
 * Unlike a call to one of the @ref Send functions, a Recv function will not
 * return with an error if an interface is down (due to bus-off or setting
 * of stop mode) or in sleep mode. Moreover, in such a case there may still
 * be some CAN messages in the socket buffer which could be read out
 * successfully. @n
 * @n
 * It is possible to receive a high precision timestamp with every CAN
 * message. The condition is a former instruction to the socket via
 * @ref RTCAN_RTIOC_TAKE_TIMESTAMP. The timestamp will be copied to the
 * @c msg_control buffer of <TT>struct msghdr</TT> if it points to a valid
 * memory location with size of @ref nanosecs_abs_t. If this
 * is a NULL pointer the timestamp will be discarded silently. @n
 * @n
 * @b Note: A @c msg_controllen of @c 0 upon completion of the function call
 *          indicates that no timestamp is available for that message.
 * @n
 * @n
 * Supported Flags [in]:
 * - MSG_DONTWAIT (By setting this flag the operation will only succeed if
 *                 it would not block, i.e. if there is a message in the
 *                 socket buffer. This flag takes precedence over a timeout
 *                 specified by @ref RTCAN_RTIOC_RCV_TIMEOUT.)
 * - MSG_PEEK     (Receive a message but leave it in the socket buffer. The
 *                 next receive operation will get that message again.)
 * .
 * @n
 * Supported Flags [out]: none @n
 * @n
 * @coretags{mode-unrestricted}
 * @n
 * Specific return values:
 * - Non-negative value (Indicating the successful reception of a CAN message.
 *   For @c SOCK_RAW, this is the size of struct can_frame regardless of
 *   the actual size of the payload.)
 * - -EFAULT (It was not possible to access user space memory area at one
 *            of the specified addresses.)
 * - -EINVAL (Unsupported flag detected, or invalid length of socket address
 *            buffer, or invalid length of message control buffer)
 * - -EMSGSIZE (Zero or more than one iovec buffer passed, or buffer too
 *              small)
 * - -EAGAIN (No data available in non-blocking mode)
 * - -EBADF (Socket was closed.)
 * - -EINTR (Operation was interrupted explicitly or by signal.)
 * - -ETIMEDOUT (Timeout)
 * .
 * @n
 * @n
 * @anchor Send
 * <b>Send, Sendto, Sendmsg</b> @n
 * These functions send out CAN messages. Only one message per call can
 * be transmitted, so only one buffer with the correct length must be passed.
 * For @c SOCK_RAW, this is the size of struct can_frame. @n
 * @n
 * The following only applies to @c SOCK_RAW: If a socket address of
 * struct sockaddr_can is given, only @c can_ifindex is used. It is also
 * possible to omit the socket address. Then the interface the socket is
 * bound to will be used for sending messages. @n
 * @n
 * If an interface goes down (due to bus-off or setting of stop mode) all
 * senders that were blocked on this interface will be woken up. @n
 * @n
 * @n
 * Supported Flags:
 * - MSG_DONTWAIT (By setting this flag the transmit operation will only
 *                 succeed if it would not block. This flag takes precedence
 *                 over a timeout specified by @ref RTCAN_RTIOC_SND_TIMEOUT.)
 * .
 * @coretags{mode-unrestricted}
 * @n
 * Specific return values:
 * - Non-negative value equal to given buffer size (Indicating the
 *   successful completion of the function call. See also note.)
 * - -EOPNOTSUPP (MSG_OOB flag is not supported.)
 * - -EINVAL (Unsupported flag detected @e or: Invalid length of socket
 *            address @e or: Invalid address family @e or: Data length code
 *            of CAN frame not between 0 and 15 @e or: CAN standard frame has
 *            got an ID not between 0 and 2031)
 * - -EMSGSIZE (Zero or more than one buffer passed or invalid size of buffer)
 * - -EFAULT (It was not possible to access user space memory area at one
 *            of the specified addresses.)
 * - -ENXIO (Invalid CAN interface index - @c 0 is not allowed here - or
 *           socket not bound or rather bound to all interfaces.)
 * - -ENETDOWN (Controller is bus-off or in stopped state.)
 * - -ECOMM (Controller is sleeping)
 * - -EAGAIN (Cannot transmit without blocking but a non-blocking
 *            call was requested.)
 * - -EINTR (Operation was interrupted explicitly or by signal)
 * - -EBADF (Socket was closed.)
 * - -ETIMEDOUT (Timeout)
 * .
 * @b Note: A successful completion of the function call does not implicate a
 *          successful transmission of the message.
