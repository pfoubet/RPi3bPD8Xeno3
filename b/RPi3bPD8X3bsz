 * - -EPROTONOSUPPORT (Protocol is not supported by the driver.
 *                     See @ref CAN_PROTO "CAN protocols"
 *                     for possible protocols.)

 * Specific return values: see @ref CANIOCTLs "below" @n
 * @n
 * @n
 * @anchor Bind
 * @b Bind @n
 * Binds a socket to one or all CAN devices (see struct sockaddr_can). If
 * a filter list has been defined with setsockopt (see @ref Sockopts),
 * it will be used upon reception of CAN frames to decide whether the
 * bound socket will receive a frame. If no filter has been defined, the
 * socket will receive @b all CAN frames on the specified interface(s). @n
 * @n
 * Binding to special interface index @c 0 will make the socket receive
 * CAN frames from all CAN interfaces. @n
 * @n
 * Binding to an interface index is also relevant for the @ref Send functions
 * because they will transmit a message over the interface the socket is
 * bound to when no socket address is given to them. @n
 * @n
 * @n
 * @coretags{secondary-only}
 * @n
 * Specific return values:
 * - -EFAULT (It was not possible to access user space memory area at the
 *            specified address.)
 * - -ENOMEM (Not enough memory to fulfill the operation)
 * - -EINVAL (Invalid address family, or invalid length of address structure)
 * - -ENODEV (Invalid CAN interface index)
 * - -ENOSPC (No enough space for filter list)
 * - -EBADF  (Socket is about to be closed)
 * - -EAGAIN (Too many receivers. Old binding (if any) is still active.
 *            Close some sockets and try again.)
 * .
 * @n
 * @n
 * @anchor Sockopts
 * <b>Setsockopt, Getsockopt</b>@n
 * These functions allow to set and get various socket options. Currently,
 * only CAN raw sockets are supported. @n
 * @n
 * Supported Levels and Options:
 * @n
 * - Level @b SOL_CAN_RAW : CAN RAW protocol (see @ref CAN_RAW)
 *   - Option @ref CAN_RAW_FILTER : CAN filter list
 *   - Option @ref CAN_RAW_ERR_FILTER : CAN error mask
 *   - Option @ref CAN_RAW_LOOPBACK : CAN TX loopback to local sockets
 *   .
 * .
 * @n
 * @coretags{task-unrestricted}
 * Specific return values: see links to options above. @n
 * @n
 * @n
 * @anchor Recv
 * <b>Recv, Recvfrom, Recvmsg</b> @n
 * These functions receive CAN messages from a socket. Only one
 * message per call can be received, so only one buffer with the correct length
 * must be passed. For @c SOCK_RAW, this is the size of struct can_frame. @n
 * @n
 * Unlike a call to one of the @ref Send functions, a Recv function will not
 * return with an error if an interface is down (due to bus-off or setting
 * of stop mode) or in sleep mode. Moreover, in such a case there may still
 * be some CAN messages in the socket buffer which could be read out
 * successfully. @n
 * @n
 * It is possible to receive a high precision timestamp with every CAN
 * message. The condition is a former instruction to the socket via
 * @ref RTCAN_RTIOC_TAKE_TIMESTAMP. The timestamp will be copied to the
 * @c msg_control buffer of <TT>struct msghdr</TT> if it points to a valid
 * memory location with size of @ref nanosecs_abs_t. If this
 * is a NULL pointer the timestamp will be discarded silently. @n
 * @n
 * @b Note: A @c msg_controllen of @c 0 upon completion of the function call
 *          indicates that no timestamp is available for that message.
 * @n
 * @n
 * Supported Flags [in]:
 * - MSG_DONTWAIT (By setting this flag the operation will only succeed if
 *                 it would not block, i.e. if there is a message in the
 *                 socket buffer. This flag takes precedence over a timeout
 *                 specified by @ref RTCAN_RTIOC_RCV_TIMEOUT.)
 * - MSG_PEEK     (Receive a message but leave it in the socket buffer. The
 *                 next receive operation will get that message again.)
 * .
 * @n
 * Supported Flags [out]: none @n
 * @n
 * @coretags{mode-unrestricted}
 * @n
 * Specific return values:
 * - Non-negative value (Indicating the successful reception of a CAN message.
 *   For @c SOCK_RAW, this is the size of struct can_frame regardless of
 *   the actual size of the payload.)
 * - -EFAULT (It was not possible to access user space memory area at one
 *            of the specified addresses.)
 * - -EINVAL (Unsupported flag detected, or invalid length of socket address
 *            buffer, or invalid length of message control buffer)
 * - -EMSGSIZE (Zero or more than one iovec buffer passed, or buffer too
 *              small)
 * - -EAGAIN (No data available in non-blocking mode)
 * - -EBADF (Socket was closed.)
 * - -EINTR (Operation was interrupted explicitly or by signal.)
 * - -ETIMEDOUT (Timeout)
 * .
 * @n
 * @n
 * @anchor Send
 * <b>Send, Sendto, Sendmsg</b> @n
 * These functions send out CAN messages. Only one message per call can
 * be transmitted, so only one buffer with the correct length must be passed.
 * For @c SOCK_RAW, this is the size of struct can_frame. @n
 * @n
 * The following only applies to @c SOCK_RAW: If a socket address of
 * struct sockaddr_can is given, only @c can_ifindex is used. It is also
 * possible to omit the socket address. Then the interface the socket is
 * bound to will be used for sending messages. @n
 * @n
 * If an interface goes down (due to bus-off or setting of stop mode) all
 * senders that were blocked on this interface will be woken up. @n
 * @n
 * @n
 * Supported Flags:
 * - MSG_DONTWAIT (By setting this flag the transmit operation will only
 *                 succeed if it would not block. This flag takes precedence
 *                 over a timeout specified by @ref RTCAN_RTIOC_SND_TIMEOUT.)
 * .
 * @coretags{mode-unrestricted}
 * @n
 * Specific return values:
 * - Non-negative value equal to given buffer size (Indicating the
 *   successful completion of the function call. See also note.)
 * - -EOPNOTSUPP (MSG_OOB flag is not supported.)
 * - -EINVAL (Unsupported flag detected @e or: Invalid length of socket
 *            address @e or: Invalid address family @e or: Data length code
 *            of CAN frame not between 0 and 15 @e or: CAN standard frame has
 *            got an ID not between 0 and 2031)
 * - -EMSGSIZE (Zero or more than one buffer passed or invalid size of buffer)
 * - -EFAULT (It was not possible to access user space memory area at one
 *            of the specified addresses.)
 * - -ENXIO (Invalid CAN interface index - @c 0 is not allowed here - or
 *           socket not bound or rather bound to all interfaces.)
 * - -ENETDOWN (Controller is bus-off or in stopped state.)
 * - -ECOMM (Controller is sleeping)
 * - -EAGAIN (Cannot transmit without blocking but a non-blocking
 *            call was requested.)
 * - -EINTR (Operation was interrupted explicitly or by signal)
 * - -EBADF (Socket was closed.)
 * - -ETIMEDOUT (Timeout)
 * .
 * @b Note: A successful completion of the function call does not implicate a
 *          successful transmission of the message.

/* Summary:

All the apparent functions defined here are macros. The idea
is that you would use these pre-tested macros to solve a
very specific set of problems, and they would run fast.
Caution: no side-effects in arguments please!! They may be
evaluated MANY times!!

These macros operate a stack of objects.  Each object starts life
small, and may grow to maturity.  (Consider building a word syllable
by syllable.)  An object can move while it is growing.  Once it has
been "finished" it never changes address again.  So the "top of the
stack" is typically an immature growing object, while the rest of the
stack is of mature, fixed size and fixed address objects.

These routines grab large chunks of memory, using a function you
supply, called `obstack_chunk_alloc'.  On occasion, they free chunks,
by calling `obstack_chunk_free'.  You must define them and declare
them before using any obstack macros.

Each independent stack is represented by a `struct obstack'.
Each of the obstack macros expects a pointer to such a structure
as the first argument.

One motivation for this package is the problem of growing char strings
in symbol tables.  Unless you are "fascist pig with a read-only mind"
--Gosper's immortal quote from HAKMEM item 154, out of context--you
would not like to put any arbitrary upper limit on the length of your
symbols.

In practice this often means you will build many short symbols and a
few long symbols.  At the time you are reading a symbol you don't know
how long it is.  One traditional method is to read a symbol into a
buffer, realloc()ating the buffer every time you try to read a symbol
that is longer than the buffer.  This is beaut, but you still will
want to copy the symbol from the buffer to a more permanent
symbol-table entry say about half the time.

With obstacks, you can work differently.  Use one obstack for all symbol
names.  As you read a symbol, grow the name in the obstack gradually.
When the name is complete, finalize it.  Then, if the symbol exists already,
free the newly read name.

The way we do this is to take a large chunk, allocating memory from
low addresses.  When you want to build a symbol in the chunk you just
add chars above the current "high water mark" in the chunk.  When you
have finished adding chars, because you got to the end of the symbol,
you know how long the chars are, and you can create a new object.
Mostly the chars will not burst over the highest address of the chunk,
because you would typically expect a chunk to be (say) 100 times as
long as an average object.

In case that isn't clear, when we have enough chars to make up
the object, THEY ARE ALREADY CONTIGUOUS IN THE CHUNK (guaranteed)
so we just point to it where it lies.  No moving of chars is
needed and this is the second win: potentially long strings need
never be explicitly shuffled. Once an object is formed, it does not
change its address during its lifetime.

When the chars burst over a chunk boundary, we allocate a larger
chunk, and then copy the partly formed object from the end of the old
chunk to the beginning of the new larger chunk.  We then carry on
accreting characters to the end of the object as we normally would.

A special macro is provided to add a single char at a time to a
growing object.  This allows the use of register variables, which
break the ordinary 'growth' macro.

Summary:
	We allocate large chunks.
	We carve out one object at a time from the current chunk.
	Once carved, an object never moves.
	We are free to append data of any size to the currently
	  growing object.
	Exactly one object is growing in an obstack at any one time.
	You can run one obstack per control block.
	You may have as many control blocks as you dare.
	Because of the way we do it, you can `unwind' an obstack
	  back to a previous state. (You may remove objects much
	  as you would with a stack.)

Using a pool
	of SCHED_FIFO threads, the code first calibrates, by estimating how
	much work the system under test can perform when running
	uninterrupted over a second.

	The same thread pool is re-started afterwards, as a SCHED_QUOTA
	group this time, which is allotted a user-definable percentage of
	the global quota interval (CONFIG_XENO_OPT_SCHED_QUOTA_PERIOD).
	Using the reference calibration value obtained by running the
	SCHED_FIFO pool, the percentage of runtime consumed by the
	SCHED_QUOTA group over a second is calculated.

	A successful test shows that the effective percentage of runtime
	observed with the SCHED_QUOTA group closely matches the allotted
	quota (barring rounding errors and marginal latency). pthread_setschedparam_ex    malloc  sched_setconfig_np(install) sched_getconfig_np  check: %d windows   [%d] offset = { %ld s, %ld ns }, duration = { %ld s, %ld ns }, ptid = %d    threadA threadB threadC sched_setconfig_np(start)   sched-tp.c  schedule overflowed unexpected schedule:

%s [options] threadspec threadspec...
Create threads of various types and attempt to switch context between these
threads, printing the count of context switches every second.

Available options are:
--help or -h, cause this program to print this help string and exit;
--lines <lines> or -l <lines> print headers every <lines> lines.
--quiet or -q, prevent this program from printing every second the count of
context switches;
--really-quiet or -Q, prevent this program from printing any output;
--timeout <duration> or -T <duration>, limit the test duration to <duration>
seconds;
--nofpu or -n, disables any use of FPU instructions.
--stress <period> or -s <period> enable a stress mode where:
  context switches occur every <period> us;
  a background task uses fpu (and check) fpu all the time.
--freeze trace upon error.

Each 'threadspec' specifies the characteristics of a thread to be created:
threadspec = (rtk|rtup|rtus|rtuo)(_fp|_ufpp|_ufps)*[0-9]*
rtk for a kernel-space real-time thread;
rtup for a user-space real-time thread running in primary mode,
rtus for a user-space real-time thread running in secondary mode,
rtuo for a user-space real-time thread oscillating between primary and
secondary mode,

_fp means that the created thread will have the XNFPU bit armed (only valid for
rtk),
_ufpp means that the created thread will use the FPU when in primary mode
(invalid for rtus),
_ufps means that the created thread will use the FPU when in secondary mode
(invalid for rtk and rtup),

[0-9]* specifies the ID of the CPU where the created thread will run, 0 if
unspecified.

Passing no 'threadspec' is equivalent to running:
%s    %s%d   

Passing only the --nofpu or -n argument is equivalent to running:
%s  

# To build static applications for the Cobalt core, we need to split

$1 [options] command-line

Split command-line in two parts for linking static applications with
the Xenomai POSIX/Cobalt interface in two stages, so that symbols
from the system libraries are not wrapped.

Options:
-q be quiet
-v be verbose (print each command before running it)
-n dry run (print all commands but don't run any)

Example:
$1 -v gcc -o foo foo.o -Wl,@/usr/xenomai/lib/cobalt.wrappers -L/usr/xenomai/lib -lcobalt -lmodechk -lpthread -lrt
will print and run:
+ gcc -o foo.tmp -Wl,-Ur -nostdlib foo.o -Wl,@/usr/xenomai/lib/cobalt.wrappers -Wl,@/usr/xenomai/lib/modechk.wrappers -L/usr/xenomai/lib
+ gcc -o foo foo.tmp -L/usr/xenomai/lib -lcobalt -lmodechk -lpthread -lrt
+ rm foo.tmp

Generate load, using an assorted set of commands and optionnaly:
- hackbench if the path to the hackbench binary is specified with -b;
- nc to send TCP data to "server" port "port" if -s is specified (if -p
is not specified, the port 9, aka discard is used);
- dd to write data under "mntpoint" if -m is specified.

during the runtime of the LTP test if the path to the LTP installation

xeno-test [ -l "load command" ] [ -k ] [ -r ] [ -- ] [ latency test options ]

Run a basic test/benchmark of Xenomai on your platform, by first starting a
few unit tests, then running the latency test under the load generated by
"load-command".

By default, the load command is "dohell 900", which will generate load during
15 minutes. To generate a more realistic load see dohell help.

This script accepts the -k option to tell the unit test loop to keep
going upon a failing test. Otherwise xeno-test stops immediately.

If the script is passed the -r option, real-time stress is added to the test,
with the help of the "switchtest" test. But beware: the latency test figures are
then no longer meaningful.

Any other option passed on the command line is passed to the latency test.

Example:
xeno-test -l "dohell -s 192.168.0.5 -m /mnt -l /ltp" -t 2

Will generate load including network load using the server at IP address
192.168.0.5, some I/O under the moint point /mnt, and the LTP testsuite
installed under the /ltp directory, and use the latency test by measuring the
timer irq latency.

.SH "NAME"
switchtest \- Xenomai context switch test
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.sp
\fBswitchtest\fR [options] threadspec threadspec\&...
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.sp
\fBswitchtest\fR is part of Xenomai\&. It can be used to test thread context switches\&. \fBswitchtest\fR creates threads of various types and attempts to switch context between these threads, printing the count of context switches every second\&. A suitable Xenomai enabled kernel with the respective module (xeno_posix) must be installed\&.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.sp
Each threadspec specifies the characteristics of a thread to be created:
.sp
threadspec = (rtk|rtup|rtus|rtuo)(_fp|_ufpp|_ufps)*[0\-9]*
.PP
\fBrtk\fR
.RS 4
for a kernel\-space real\-time thread
.RE
.PP
\fBrtup\fR
.RS 4
for a user\-space real\-time thread running in primary mode
.RE
.PP
\fBrtus\fR
.RS 4
for a user\-space real\-time thread running in secondary mode
.RE
.PP
\fBrtuo\fR
.RS 4
for a user\-space real\-time thread oscillating between primary and secondary mode
.RE
.PP
\fB_fp\fR
.RS 4
means that the created thread will have the XNFPU bit armed (only valid for rtk)
.RE
.PP
\fB_ufpp\fR
.RS 4
means that the created thread will use the FPU when in primary mode (invalid for rtus)
.RE
.PP
\fB_ufps\fR
.RS 4
means that the created thread will use the FPU when in secondary mode (invalid for rtk and rtup)
.RE
.PP
\fB[0\-9]\fR
.RS 4
specifies the ID of the CPU where the created thread will run, 0 if unspecified
.RE
.sp
Passing no \fBthreadspec\fR is equivalent to running:
.sp
switchtest rtkN rtkN rtk_fpN rtk_fpN rtk_fp_ufppN rtk_fp_ufppN rtupN rtupN rtup_ufppN rtup_ufppN rtusN rtusN rtus_ufpsN rtus_ufpsN rtuoN rtuoN rtuo_ufppN rtuo_ufppN rtuo_ufpsN rtuo_ufpsN rtuo_ufpp_ufpsN rtuo_ufpp_ufpsN
.sp
with N=1,\&...,nr_cpus, i\&.e\&. occurrences of all the arguments for each CPU
.sp
Passing only the \-\-nofpu or \-n argument is equivalent to running:
.sp
switchtest rtkN rtkN rtupN rtupN rtusN rtusN rtuoN rtuoN
.sp
similar to the above\&.
.sp
\fBswitchtest\fR accepts the following options:
.PP
\fB\-\-help, \-h\fR
.RS 4
print usage information and exit
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-lines <lines>, \-l <lines>\fR
.RS 4
print headers every <lines> lines
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-quiet or \-q\fR
.RS 4
prevent this program from printing every second the count of ncontext switches
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-really\-quiet or \-Q\fR
.RS 4
prevent this program from printing any output
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-timeout <duration>, \-T <duration>\fR
.RS 4
limit the test duration to <duration> seconds
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-nofpu, \-n\fR
.RS 4
disables any use of FPU instructions

.SH "NAME"
slackspot \- Trace secondary mode switches
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.sp
\fBslackspot\fR [ options ]
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.sp
\fBslackspot\fR is a utility to decode the trace data collected by the Cobalt core when CONFIG_XENO_OPT_DEBUG_TRACE_RELAX is enabled in the kernel configuration\&.
.sp
This data describes each call hierarchy causing migration to secondary mode (i\&.e\&. \fIrelaxes\fR) within the application\&. \fBslackspot\fR presents such data in a human\-readable format as symbolic stack backtraces, for helping in debugging spurious relaxes\&.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.sp
\fBslackspot\fR accepts the following options:
.PP
\fB\-\-file <trace\-file>\fR
.RS 4
Read the trace information to decode from
\fItrace\-file\fR\&. By default, trace data is read from
/proc/xenomai/debug/relax
unless the standard input stream was redirected, in which case
stdin
is read\&. In addition, the dash character "\-" is interpreted as a placeholder for
stdin\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-path <dir[:dir\&...]>\fR
.RS 4
Search directory list for executables and dynamic libraries\&. Directories are separatared by a semi\-colon within the list\&. Each directory may be scanned for binary executables when resolving symbols found in stack backtraces\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-filter\-in <name=exp[,name=\&...]>\fR
.RS 4
Only retain backtraces matching the given filters in the output\&. Each filter is specified by a
\fIname=<expr>\fR
pair, where
\fIname\fR
identifies the information field to be matched in the backtrace, and
\fIexpr\fR
is a regular expression which should match such data\&. Filters are separated by a comma within the list\&. The available filters are as follows:
.sp
.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04'\(bu\h'+03'\c
.\}
.el \{\
.sp -1
.IP \(bu 2.3
.\}
\fIthread\fR
matches the thread name\&.
.RE
.sp
.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04'\(bu\h'+03'\c
.\}
.el \{\
.sp -1
.IP \(bu 2.3
.\}
\fIpid\fR
matches the kernel task identifier, i\&.e\&. per\-task
\fIpid\fR\&.
.RE
.sp
.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04'\(bu\h'+03'\c
.\}
.el \{\
.sp -1
.IP \(bu 2.3
.\}
\fIexe\fR
matches the name of the main executable being traced\&.
.RE
.sp
.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04'\(bu\h'+03'\c
.\}
.el \{\
.sp -1
.IP \(bu 2.3
.\}
\fIfunction\fR
matches the name of the function being traced\&.
.RE
.sp
.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04'\(bu\h'+03'\c
.\}
.el \{\
.sp -1
.IP \(bu 2.3
.\}
\fIfile\fR
matches the path of the source file being traced\&.
.RE
.sp
.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04'\(bu\h'+03'\c
.\}
.el \{\
.sp -1
.IP \(bu 2.3
.\}
\fImap\fR
matches the path of the mapped executable being traced\&.
.RE
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-filter <name=exp[,name=\&...]>\fR
.RS 4
A shorthand for
\fB\-\-filter\-in\fR\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-filter\-out <name=exp[,name=\&...]>\fR
.RS 4
Only retain backtraces NOT matching the given filters in the output\&. This option inverts the sense of matching defined by
\fB\-\-filter\-in\fR\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBCROSS_COMPILE=<toolchain\-prefix>\fR
.RS 4
A cross\-compilation toolchain prefix should be specified for decoding the data obtained from a target system, on a build/development machine\&. When present, the value of CROSS_COMPILE will be prepended to
gcc
and
addr2line
for running the corresponding utilities on the development system\&.
.RE
.SH "VERSIONS"
.sp
\fBslackspot\fR appeared in Xenomai 3\&.0 for the \fICobalt\fR real\-time core\&.
.SH "EXAMPLE"
.sp
In the following scenario, the \fItarget\fR system built with the CONFIG_XENO_OPT_DEBUG_TRACE_RELAX feature enabled in the kernel configuration, just ran the \fI/bin/relax\fR program\&.
.sp
This program caused a transition to secondary mode switch of the current task (\fITask 2\fR) as a result of calling putchar()\&. The Cobalt core saved the corresponding backtrace information, which is now available from /proc/xenomai/debug/relax on the target system\&.
.sp
Since the target system has limited horsepower, and doesn\(cqt have access to the binary utilities required for decoding the trace data, we will send such data over the network to the \fIhost\fR system, in order for the latter to do the decoding and display the call stacks\&.
.sp
We use the standard netcat utility to send and receive the contents of /proc/xenomai/debug/relax over the wire between the target and host systems\&. The host will also have to mention where the cross\-compilation toolchain can be found, by setting the CROSS_COMPILE variable appropriately\&. The example assumes that /opt/rootfs/MPC5200/lib is the host\-based location of the system libraries mounted over NFS onto the target file hierarchy\&.

.SH "NAME"
autotune \- Calibrate the Xenomai core clock timer
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.sp
\fBautotune\fR [ options ]
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.sp
\fBautotune\fR is a utility to determine the best calibration values (aka \fIgravity triplet\fR) for the core clock timer\&.
.sp
The time spent traversing the kernel code from the low\-level Xenomai timer handler until the kernel\-based client handler is invoked, is shorter than the time required to schedule in a kernel thread instead\&. It takes even more time to switch in a user\-space thread, which entails changing the current memory address space, performing potentially time\-consuming MMU\-related operations\&.
.sp
For this reason, Xenomai differentiates timers on the target context they activate, among IRQ(handler), kernel and user threads, anticipating the next timer shot accordingly, so that such context is activated as close as possible to the ideal time\&. This anticipation is called the \fIgravity\fR of the clock serving the timer, which is actually a triplet representing the three possible types of contexts the timer can activate\&.
.sp
Therefore, the gravity is a static adjustment value to account for the basic latency of the target system for responding to timer events, as perceived by the client code waiting for the wake up events\&. Such latency is increased by additional factors, such as:
.sp
.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04'\(bu\h'+03'\c
.\}
.el \{\
.sp -1
.IP \(bu 2.3
.\}
bus or CPU cache latency,
.RE
.sp
.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04'\(bu\h'+03'\c
.\}
.el \{\
.sp -1
.IP \(bu 2.3
.\}
delay required to program the timer chip for the next shot,
.RE
.sp
.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04'\(bu\h'+03'\c
.\}
.el \{\
.sp -1
.IP \(bu 2.3
.\}
code running with interrupts disabled on the CPU to receive the IRQ,
.RE
.sp
.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04'\(bu\h'+03'\c
.\}
.el \{\
.sp -1
.IP \(bu 2.3
.\}
inter\-processor serialization (\fIspinlocks\fR)\&.
.RE
.sp
\fBautotune\fR runs a series of internal calibration tests for estimating the most appropriate gravity values for its real\-time clock timer, retaining the final values\&.

.sp
\fBautotune\fR requires the \fBCONFIG_XENO_OPT_AUTOTUNE\fR option to be enabled in the kernel configuration\&.
.sp .5v
.RE
.SH "OPTIONS"
.sp
\fBautotune\fR accepts the following options:
.PP
\fB\-\-irq\fR
.RS 4
Estimate the IRQ gravity value, which is the shortest time the platform needs to deliver an IRQ to a Xenomai interrupt handler in kernel space\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-kernel\fR
.RS 4
Estimate the kernel gravity value, which is the shortest time the platform needs to deliver an IRQ to a RTDM task running in kernel space\&. This delay includes the context switching time\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-user\fR
.RS 4
Estimate the user gravity value, which is the shortest time the platform needs to deliver an IRQ to a user\-space task/thread running in a Xenomai application process\&. This delay includes the context switching time\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-period <ns>\fR
.RS 4
Set the sampling period to the given count of nanoseconds\&. The estimation is performed by measuring the jitter between the ideal time at which a timer tick should be received, and the actual time it is eventually received, for a series of ticks\&. This value expresses the delay between two of these ticks\&. If too short, a lockup might occur\&. A commonly observed result is that the larger the delay, the higher the latency, due to CPU cache effects (i\&.e\&. the real\-time code/data is more likely to get evicted from the cachelines as the non real\-time activity can slip in, treading over a larger address space)\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-reset\fR
.RS 4
Reset the gravity values to their factory defaults\&. These defaults are statically defined by the Xenomai platform code\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-noload\fR
.RS 4
Disable load generation while auto\-tuning\&.
\fBautotune\fR
runs a load generator internally in parallel to estimating the latency, in order to eliminate irregular delays which tend to appear on fully idle systems\&. Therefore, keeping the load generation enabled most often leads to a more accurate estimation\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-verbose[=level]\fR
.RS 4
Set verbosity to the desired level, 1 means almost quiet (default), 2 means fully verbose\&.

\fBautotune\fR appeared in Xenomai 3\&.0 for the \fICobalt\fR real\-time core\&.

The auto\-tuning process may take some time for completing the estimation\&. Although this delay may vary across hardware platforms, running for 30 seconds is common\&.
.sp
Once the gravity values are known for a particular hardware, one may write them to /proc/xenomai/clock/coreclck from some system init script to set up the Xenomai core clock accordingly, instead of running the auto\-tuner after each boot e\&.g:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
    /* change the user gravity to 1728 ns (default) */
# echo 1728 > /proc/xenomai/clock/coreclck
    /* change the IRQ gravity to 129 ns */
# echo 129i > /proc/xenomai/clock/coreclck
    /* change the user and kernel gravities to 1728 and 907 ns resp\&. */
# echo "1728u 907k" > /proc/xenomai/clock/coreclck

Over Cobalt, only \fBxeno\-config \-\-posix \-\-ldflags\fR (or \fB\-\-rtdm\fR as an alias) returns the proper linker flags to cause POSIX routines invoked by the application to be wrapped to their respective Xenomai implementation\&.

Conversely, mentioning \fB\-\-posix\fR along with other API switches with \fB\-\-ldflags\fR will cause POSIX symbol wrapping to take place, e\&.g\&. use \fB\-\-posix \-\-alchemy \-\-ldflags\fR for mixed API support with POSIX symbol wrapping\&.

Over Cobalt, a set of standard routines which may invoke regular Linux system calls can trigger an assertion failure on entry, if the caller must leave the real\-time mode (aka "secondary mode switch") to execute such routine\&.
.RE

The assertion failure is triggered if the calling thread has set the PTHREAD_WARNSW flag by a call to pthread_setmode_np()\&.

By default, the mode checking routines are substituted to the original ones using the symbol wrapping mechanism also used for interposing on POSIX services\&. \fB\-\-no\-mode\-check\fR disables such substitution\&.

<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph"><p><strong>clocktest</strong> is part of the Xenomai test suite and tests the Clock. For each
CPU, it repeatedly prints a time offset (compared to the reference
gettimeofday()), a drift value, the number of warps and the maximum warp in
microseconds.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>For this program to work, you need to run a suitable Xenomai enabled kernel
with the respective module (xeno_posix).</p></div>
