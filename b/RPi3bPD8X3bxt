 * Security hooks for file operations
 *
 * @file_permission:
 *	Check file permissions before accessing an open file.  This hook is
 *	called by various operations that read or write files.  A security
 *	module can use this hook to perform additional checking on these

 *	bracketing or policy changes.  Notice that this hook is used when the
 *	actual read/write operations are performed, whereas the
 *	inode_security_ops hook is called when a file is opened (as well as
 *	many other operations).
 *	Caveat:  Although this hook can be used to revalidate permissions for
 *	various system call operations that read or write files, it does not
 *	address the revalidation of permissions for memory-mapped files.

 * sockets in the abstract name space is completely unmediated.  Sufficient
 * control of Unix domain sockets in the abstract name space isn't possible
 * using only the socket layer hooks, since we need to know the actual target
 * socket, which is not looked up until we are inside the af_unix code.
