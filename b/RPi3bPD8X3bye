Patch 6.2.505
Problem:    Help for -P argument is missing. (Ronald Hoellwarth)
Solution:   Add the patch that was missing in 6.2.419.
Files:	    runtime/doc/starting.txt

Patch 6.2.506 (extra)
Problem:    Win32: When 'encoding' is a codepage then reading a utf-8 file
	    only works when iconv is available.  Writing a file in another
	    codepage uses the wrong kind of conversion.
Solution:   Use internal conversion functions.  Enable reading and writing
	    files with 'fileencoding' different from 'encoding' for all valid
	    codepages and utf-8 without the need for iconv.
Files:	    src/fileio.c, src/testdir/Make_dos.mak, src/testdir/test52.in,
	    src/testdir/test52.ok

Patch 6.2.507
Problem:    The ownership of the file with the password for the NetBeans
	    connection is not checked.  "-nb={file}" doesn't work for GTK.
Solution:   Only accept the file when owned by the user and not accessible by
	    others.  Detect "-nb=" for GTK.
Files:	    src/netbeans.c, src/gui_gtk_x11.c

Patch 6.2.508
Problem:    Win32: "v:lang" does not show the current language for messages if

Files:	    src/ex_cmds2.c

Patch 6.2.510 (after 6.2.507)
Problem:    Warning for pointer conversion.
Solution:   Add a type cast.
Files:	    src/gui_gtk_x11.c

Patch 6.2.511
Problem:    Tags in Russian help files are in utf-8 encoding, which may be
	    different from 'encoding'.
Solution:   Use the "TAG_FILE_ENCODING" field in the tags file to specify the
	    encoding of the tags.  Convert help tags from 'encoding' to the
	    tag file encoding when searching for matches, do the reverse when
	    listing help tags.
Files:	    runtime/doc/tagsrch.txt, src/ex_cmds.c, src/tag.c

Patch 6.2.512
Problem:    Translating "\"\n" is useless. (Gerfried Fuchs)

Files:	    src/main.c, src/memline.c

Patch 6.2.513 (after 6.2.507)
Problem:    NetBeans: the check for owning the connection info file can be
	    simplified. (Nikolay Molchanov)
Solution:   Only check if the access mode is right.
Files:	    src/netbeans.c

Patch 6.2.514
Problem:    When a highlight/syntax group name contains invalid characters
	    there is no warning.
Solution:   Add an error for unprintable characters and a warning for other
	    invalid characters.
Files:	    src/syntax.c

Patch 6.2.515
Problem:    When using the options window 'swapfile' is reset.
Solution:   Use ":setlocal" instead of ":set".
Files:	    runtime/optwin.vim

Patch 6.2.516
Problem:    The sign column cannot be seen, looks like there are two spaces
	    before the text. (Rob Retter)
Solution:   Add the SignColumn highlight group.
Files:	    runtime/doc/options.txt, runtime/doc/sign.txt, src/option.c,
	    src/screen.c, src/syntax.c, src/vim.h

Patch 6.2.517
Problem:    Using "r*" in Visual mode on multi-byte characters replaces
	    too many characters.  In Visual Block mode replacing with a
	    multi-byte character doesn't work.
Solution:   Adjust the operator end for the difference in byte length of the
	    original and the replaced character.  Insert all bytes of a
	    multi-byte character, take care of double-wide characters.
Files:	    src/ops.c

Patch 6.2.518
Problem:    Last line of a window is not updated after using "J" and then "D".
	    (Adri Verhoef)
Solution:   When no line is found below a change that doesn't need updating,
	    update all lines below the change.
Files:	    src/screen.c

Patch 6.2.519
Problem:    Mac: cannot read/write files in MacRoman format.
Solution:   Do internal conversion from/to MacRoman to/from utf-8 and latin1.
	    (Eckehard Berns)
Files:	    src/fileio.c

Patch 6.2.520 (extra)
Problem:    The NSIS installer is outdated.
Solution:   Make it work with NSIS 2.0.  Also include console executables for
	    Win 95/98/ME and Win NT/2000/XP.  Use LZWA compression.  Use
	    "/oname" to avoid having to rename files before running NSIS.
Files:	    Makefile, nsis/gvim.nsi

Patch 6.2.521
Problem:    When using silent Ex mode the "changing a readonly file" warning
	    is omitted but the one second wait isn't. (Yakov Lerner)
Solution:   Skip the delay when "silent_mode" is set.
Files:	    src/misc1.c

Patch 6.2.522
Problem:    GUI: when changing 'cmdheight' in the gvimrc file the window
	    layout is messed up. (Keith Dart)
Solution:   Skip updating the window layout when changing 'cmdheight' while
	    still starting up.
Files:	    src/option.c

Patch 6.2.523
Problem:    When loading a session and aborting when a swap file already
	    exists, the user is left with useless windows. (Robert Webb)
Solution:   Load one file before creating the windows.
Files:	    src/ex_docmd.c

Patch 6.2.524 (extra, after 6.2.520)
Problem:    Win32: (un)installing gvimext.dll may fail if it was used.
	    The desktop and start menu links are created for the current user
	    instead of all users.
	    Using the home directory as working directory for the links is a
	    bad idea for multi-user systems.
	    Cannot use Vim from the "Open With..." menu.
Solution:   Force a reboot if necessary. (Alejandro Lopez-Valencia)  Also use
	    macros for the directory of the source and runtime files.  Use
	    "CSIDL_COMMON_*" instead of "CSIDL_*" when possible.
	    Do not specify a working directory in the links.
	    Add Vim to the "Open With..." menu. (Giuseppe Bilotta)
Files:	    nsis/gvim.nsi, src/dosinst.c, src/dosinst.h, src/uninstal.c

Patch 6.2.525
Problem:    When the history contains a very long line ":history" causes a
	    crash. (Volker Kiefel)
Solution:   Shorten the history entry to fit it in one line.
Files:	    src/ex_getln.c

Patch 6.2.526
Problem:    When s:lang is "ja" the Japanese menus are not used.
Solution:   Add 'encoding' to the language when there is no charset.
Files:	    runtime/menu.vim

Patch 6.2.527
Problem:    The 2html script uses ":wincmd p", which breaks when using some
	    autocommands.
Solution:   Remember the window numbers and jump to them with ":wincmd w".
	    Also add XHTML support. (Panagiotis Issaris)
Files:	    runtime/syntax/2html.vim

Patch 6.2.528
Problem:    NetBeans: Changes of the "~" command are not reported.
Solution:   Call netbeans_inserted() after performing "~". (Gordon Prieur)
	    Also change NetBeans debugging to append to the log file.
	    Also fix that "~" in Visual block mode changes too much if there
	    are multi-byte characters.
Files:	    src/nbdebug.c, src/normal.c, src/ops.c

Patch 6.2.529 (extra)
Problem:    VisVim only works for Admin.  Doing it for one user doesn't work.
	    (Alexandre Gouraud)
Solution:   When registering the module fails, simply continue.
Files:	    src/VisVim/VisVim.cpp

Patch 6.2.530
Problem:    Warning for missing prototype on the Amiga.
Solution:   Include time.h
Files:	    src/version.c

Patch 6.2.531
Problem:    In silent ex mode no messages are given, which makes debugging
	    very difficult.
Solution:   Do output messages when 'verbose' is set.
Files:	    src/message.c, src/ui.c

Patch 6.2.532 (extra)
Problem:    Compiling for Win32s with VC 4.1 doesn't work.
Solution:   Don't use CP_UTF8 if it's not defined.  Don't use CSIDL_COMMON*
	    when not defined.
Files:	    src/dosinst.h, src/fileio.c

Win32 console: After patch 6.2.398 Ex mode did not work. (Yasuhiro Matsumoto)

Patch 6.3a.001
Problem:    Win32: if testing for the "--binary" option fails, diff isn't used
	    at all.
Solution:   Handle the "ok" flag properly. (Yasuhiro Matsumoto)
Files:	    src/diff.c

Patch 6.3a.002
Problem:    NetBeans: An insert command from NetBeans beyond the end of a
	    buffer crashes Vim. (Xavier de Gaye)
Solution:   Use a local pos_T structure for the position.
Files:	    src/netbeans.c

Patch 6.3a.003
Problem:    E315 error with auto-formatting comments. (Henry Van Roessel)
Solution:   Pass the line number to same_leader().
Files:	    src/ops.c

Patch 6.3a.004
Problem:    Test32 fails on Windows XP for the DJGPP version.  Renaming
	    test11.out fails.
Solution:   Don't try renaming, create new files to use for the test.
Files:	    src/testdir/test32.in, src/testdir/test32.ok

Patch 6.3a.005
Problem:    ":checkpath!" does not use 'includeexpr'.
Solution:   Use a file name that was found directly.  When a file was not
	    found and the located name is empty, use the rest of the line.
Files:	    src/search.c

Patch 6.3a.006
Problem:    "yip" moves the cursor to the first yanked line, but not to the
	    first column.  Looks like not all text was yanked. (Jens Paulus)
Solution:   Move the cursor to the first column.
Files:	    src/search.c

Patch 6.3a.007
Problem:    'cindent' recognizes "enum" but not "typedef enum".
Solution:   Skip over "typedef" before checking for "enum". (Helmut Stiegler)
	    Also avoid that searching for this item goes too far back.
Files:	    src/misc1.c, src/testdir/test3.in, src/testdir/test3.ok

Patch 6.3a.008 (extra)
Problem:    Windows 98: Some of the wide functions are not implemented,
	    resulting in file I/O to fail.  This depends on what Unicode
	    support is installed.
Solution:   Handle the failure and fall back to non-wide functions.
Files:	    src/os_win32.c

Patch 6.3a.009
Problem:    Win32: Completion of filenames does not work properly when
	    'encoding' differs from the active code page.
Solution:   Use wide functions for expanding wildcards when appropriate.
Files:	    src/misc1.c

Patch 6.3a.010 (extra)
Problem:    Win32: Characters in the window title that do not appear in the
	    active codepage are replaced by a question mark.
Solution:   Use DefWindowProcW() instead of DefWindowProc() when possible.
Files:	    src/glbl_ime.cpp, src/globals.h, src/proto/gui_w16.pro,
	    src/proto/gui_w32.pro, src/gui_w16.c, src/gui_w32.c, src/gui_w48.c

Patch 6.3a.011
Problem:    Using the explorer plugin changes a local directory to the global
	    directory.
Solution:   Don't use ":chdir" to restore the current directory.  Make
	    "expand('%:p')" remove "/../" and "/./" items from the path.
Files:	    runtime/plugin/explorer.vim, src/eval.c, src/os_unix.c

Patch 6.3a.012 (extra)
Problem:    On Windows 98 the installer doesn't work, don't even get the "I
	    agree" button.  The check for the path ending in "vim" makes the
	    browse dialog hard to use.  The default path when no previous Vim
	    is installed is "c:\vim" instead of "c:\Program Files\Vim".
Solution:   Remove the background gradient command.  Change the
	    .onVerifyInstDir function to a leave function for the directory
	    page.  Don't let the install program default to c:\vim when no
	    path could be found.
Files:	    nsis/gvim.nsi, src/dosinst.c

Patch 6.3a.013 (extra)
Problem:    Win32: Characters in the menu that are not in the active codepage
	    are garbled.
Solution:   Convert menu strings from 'encoding' to the active codepage.
Files:	    src/gui_w32.c, src/gui_w48.c

Patch 6.3a.014
Problem:    Using multi-byte text and highlighting in a statusline causes gaps
	    to appear. (Helmut Stiegler)
Solution:   Advance the column by text width instead of number of bytes.  Add
	    the vim_strnsize() function.
Files:	    src/charset.c, src/proto/charset.pro, src/screen.c

Patch 6.3a.015
Problem:    Using the "select all" menu item when 'insertmode' is set and
	    clicking the mouse button doesn't return to Insert mode.  The
	    Buffers/Delete menu doesn't offer a choice to abandon a changed
	    buffer.  (Jens Paulus)
Solution:   Don't use CTRL-\ CTRL-N.  Add ":confirm" for the Buffers menu
	    items.
Files:	    runtime/menu.vim

Patch 6.3a.016
Problem:    After cancelling the ":confirm" dialog the error message and
	    hit-enter prompt may not be displayed properly.
Solution:   Flush output after showing the dialog.
Files:	    src/message.c

Patch 6.3a.017
Problem:    servername() doesn't work when Vim was started with the "-X"
	    argument or when the "exclude" in 'clipboard' matches the terminal
	    name.  (Robert Nowotniak)
Solution:   Force connecting to the X server when using client-server
	    commands.
Files:	    src/eval.c, src/globals.h, src/os_unix.c

Patch 6.3a.018 (after 6.3a.017)
Problem:    Compiler warning for return value of make_connection().
Solution:   Use void return type.
Files:	    src/eval.c

Patch 6.3a.019 (extra)
Problem:    Win32: typing non-latin1 characters doesn't work.
Solution:   Invoke _OnChar() directly to avoid that the argument is truncated
	    to a byte.  Convert the UTF-16 character to bytes according to
	    'encoding' and ignore 'termencoding'.  Same for _OnSysChar().
Files:	    src/gui_w32.c, src/gui_w48.c

Patch 6.3a.020 (extra)
Problem:    Missing support for AROS (AmigaOS reimplementation).  Amiga GUI
	    doesn't work.
Solution:   Add AROS support.  (Adam Chodorowski)
	    Fix Amiga GUI problems. (Georg Steger, Ali Akcaagac)
Files:	    Makefile, src/Make_aros.mak, src/gui_amiga.c, src/gui_amiga.h,

Patch 6.3a.021 (after 6.3a.017)
Problem:    Can't compile with X11 but without GUI.
Solution:   Put use of "gui.in_use" inside an #ifdef.
Files:	    src/eval.c

Patch 6.3a.022
Problem:    When typing Tabs when 'softtabstop' is used and 'list' is set a
	    tab is counted for two spaces.
Solution:   Use the "L" flag in 'cpoptions' to tell whether a tab is counted
	    as two spaces or as 'tabstop'. (Antony Scriven)
Files:	    runtime/doc/options.txt, src/edit.c

Patch 6.3a.023
Problem:    Completion on the command line doesn't handle backslashes
	    properly.  Only the tail of matches is shown, even when not
	    completing filenames.
Solution:   When turning the string into a pattern double backslashes.  Don't
	    omit the path when not expanding files or directories.
Files:	    src/ex_getln.c

Patch 6.3a.024
Problem:    The "save all" toolbar item fails for buffers that don't have a
	    name.  When using ":wa" or closing the Vim window and there are
	    nameless buffers, browsing for a name may cause the name being
	    given to the wrong buffer or not stored properly.  ":browse" only
	    worked for one file.
Solution:   Use ":confirm browse" for "save all".
	    Pass buffer argument to setfname().  Restore "browse" flag and
	    "forceit" after doing the work for one file.
Files:	    runtime/menu.vim, src/buffer.c, src/ex_cmds.c, src/ex_cmds2.c,

Files:	    src/option.c

Patch 6.3a.026 (extra, after 6.3a.008)
Problem:    Editing files on Windows 98 doesn't work when 'encoding' is
	    "utf-8" (Antoine Mechelynck)
	    Warning for missing function prototype.
Solution:   For all wide functions check if it failed because it is not
	    implemented.  Use ANSI function declaration for char_to_string().
Files:	    src/gui_w48.c, src/os_mswin.c, src/os_win32.c

Patch 6.3a.027 (extra, after 6.3a.026)
Problem:    Compiler warning for function argument.
Solution:   Declare both char and WCHAR arrays.
Files:	    src/gui_w48.c

Patch 6.3a.028

Files:	    src/Make_bc5.mak

Patch 6.3b.002
Problem:    Win32: conversion during file write fails when a double-byte
	    character is split over two writes.
Solution:   Fix the conversion retry without a trailing byte. (Taro Muraoka)
Files:	    src/fileio.c

Patch 6.3b.003 (extra)
Problem:    Win32: When compiling with Borland C 5.5 and 'encoding' is "utf-8"
	    then Vim can't open files under MS-Windows 98. (Antoine J.
	    Mechelynck)
Solution:   Don't use _wstat(), _wopen() and _wfopen() in this situation.
Files:	    src/os_mswin.c, src/os_win32.c

Patch 6.3b.004
Problem:    ":helpgrep" includes a trailing CR in the text line.
Solution:   Remove the CR.

Solution:   Pass the flags from find_option_end() to get_option_value().
Files:	    src/eval.c

Patch 6.3b.006
Problem:    When using "mswin.vim", CTRL-V in Insert mode leaves cursor before
	    last pasted character.  (Mathew Davis)
Solution:   Use the same Paste() function as in menu.vim.
Files:	    runtime/mswin.vim

Patch 6.3b.007
Problem:    Session file doesn't restore view on windows properly. (Robert
	    Webb)
Solution:   Restore window sizes both before and after restoring the view, so
	    that the view, cursor position and size are restored properly.
Files:	    src/ex_docmd.c

Patch 6.3b.008
Problem:    Using ":finally" in a user command doesn't always work. (Hari
	    Krishna Dara)
Solution:   Don't assume that using getexline() means the command was typed.
Files:	    src/ex_docmd.c

Patch 6.3b.009 (extra)
Problem:    Win32: When the -P argument is not found in a window title, there
	    is no error message.
Solution:   When the window can't be found give an error message and exit.
	    Also use try/except to catch failing to open the MDI window.
	    (Michael Wookey)
Files:	    src/gui_w32.c

Patch 6.3b.010
Problem:    Win32: Using the "-D" argument and expanding arguments may cause a
	    hang, because the terminal isn't initialized yet. (Vince Negri)
Solution:   Don't go into debug mode before the terminal is initialized.
Files:	    src/main.c

Patch 6.3b.011
Problem:    Using CTRL-\ e while obtaining an expression aborts the command
	    line. (Hari Krishna Dara)

Fixed							*fixed-6.4*
-----

"dFxd;" deleted the character under the cursor, "d;" didn't remember the
exclusiveness of the motion.

When using "set laststatus=2 cmdheight=2" in the .gvimrc you may only get one
line for the cmdline. (Christian Robinson)  Invoke command_height() after the
GUI has started up.

Gcc would warn "dereferencing type-punned pointer will break strict -aliasing
rules".  Avoid using typecasts for variable pointers.

Gcc 3.x interprets the -MM argument differently.  Change "-I /path" to
"-isystem /path" for "make depend".


Patch 6.3.001
Problem:    ":browse split" gives the file selection dialog twice. (Gordon
	    Bazeley)  Same problem for ":browse diffpatch".

Patch 6.3.002
Problem:    When using translated help files with non-ASCII latin1 characters
	    in the first line the utf-8 detection is wrong.
Solution:   Properly detect utf-8 characters.  When a mix of encodings is
	    detected continue with the next language and avoid a "no matches"
	    error because of "got_int" being set.  Add the directory name to
	    the error message for a duplicate tag.

Patch 6.3.005
Problem:    Crash when searching for a pattern with a character offset and
	    starting in a closed fold. (Frank Butler)

	    delete a word but only a combining character of the first
	    character, if there is one. (Raphael Finkel)
Solution:   Correctly check that one character is being deleted.
Files:	    src/misc1.c

Solution:   Check for the last byte to be part of a multi-byte character.
	    (Taro Muraoka)
Files:	    src/fileio.c

Patch 6.3.022 (extra)
Problem:    Win32: When the last character of a file name is a multi-byte
	    character and the last byte is a path separator, the file cannot
	    be written.  A trail byte that is a space makes that a file cannot
	    be opened from the command line.
Solution:   Recognize double-byte characters when parsing the command line.
	    In mch_stat() check for the last byte to be part of a multi-byte
	    character.  (Taro Muraoka)
Files:	    src/gui_w48.c, src/os_mswin.c

Patch 6.3.023
Problem:    When the "to" part of a mapping starts with its "from" part,
	    abbreviations for the same characters is not possible.  For
	    example, when <Space> is mapped to something that starts with a
	    space, typing <Space> does not expand abbreviations.
Solution:   Only disable expanding abbreviations when a mapping is not
	    remapped, don't disable it when the RHS of a mapping starts with
	    the LHS.
Files:	    src/getchar.c, src/vim.h

	    serverGetVimNames().
Files:	    src/ex_getln.c, src/gui.c, src/if_xcmdsrv.c, src/os_mswin.c

Patch 6.3.025 (extra)
Problem:    Missing NUL for list of server names.
Solution:   Add ga_append(NUL) in serverGetVimNames().
Files:	    src/os_mswin.c

Patch 6.3.026
Problem:    When ~/.vim/after/syntax/syncolor.vim contains a command that
	    reloads the colors an endless loop and/or a crash may occur.
Solution:   Only free the old value of an option when it was originally
	    allocated.  Limit recursiveness of init_highlight() to 5 levels.
Files:	    src/option.c, src/syntax.c

Patch 6.3.027
Problem:    VMS: Writing a file may insert extra CR characters.  Not all
	    terminals are recognized correctly.  Vt320 doesn't support colors.
	    Environment variables are not expanded correctly.
Solution:   Use another method to write files.  Add vt320 termcap codes for
	    colors.  (Zoltan Arpadffy)
Files:	    src/fileio.c, src/misc1.c, src/os_unix.c, src/structs.h,
	    src/term.c

Patch 6.3.028

	    Jakushev)
Solution:   Do not write the BOM marker when appending.
Files:	    src/fileio.c

Patch 6.3.029
Problem:    Crash when inserting a line break. (Walter Briscoe)
Solution:   In the syntax highlighting code, don't use an old state after a
	    change was made, current_col may be past the end of the line.
Files:	    src/syntax.c

Patch 6.3.030
Problem:    GTK 2: Crash when sourcing a script that deletes the menus, sets
	    'encoding' to "utf-8" and loads the menus again.  GTK error
	    message when tooltip text is in a wrong encoding.
Solution:   Don't copy characters from the old screen to the new screen when
	    switching 'encoding' to utf-8, they may be invalid.  Only set the
	    tooltip when it is valid utf-8.
Files:	    src/gui_gtk.c, src/mbyte.c, src/proto/mbyte.pro, src/screen.c

Patch 6.3.031
Problem:    When entering a mapping and pressing Tab halfway the command line
	    isn't redrawn properly. (Adri Verhoef)

	    the Normal mode command.
Files:	    src/normal.c

Patch 6.3.034

	    lines below the change.
Files:	    src/screen.c

Patch 6.3.040
Problem:    Error handling does not always work properly and may cause a
	    buffer to be marked as if it's viewed in a window while it isn't.
	    Also when selecting "Abort" at the attention prompt.
Solution:   Add enter_cleanup() and leave_cleanup() functions to move
	    saving/restoring things for error handling to one place.
	    Clear a buffer read error when it's unloaded.
Files:	    src/buffer.c, src/ex_docmd.c, src/ex_eval.c,

	    doesn't work. (Valery Kondakoff)
Solution:   Use a wide function to change directory.
Files:	    src/os_mswin.c

Patch 6.3.042

Solution:   Scroll over the closed fold.
Files:	    src/move.c

Patch 6.3.043
Problem:    'hlsearch' highlighting sometimes disappears when inserting text
	    in PHP code with syntax highlighting. (Marcel Svitalsky)

	    lines.
Files:	    src/screen.c

Patch 6.3.044 (extra)

==============================================================================
*41.1*	Introduction				*vim-script-intro* *script*

Your first experience with Vim scripts is the vimrc file.  Vim reads it when
it starts up and executes the commands.  You can set options to values you
prefer.  And you can use any colon command in it (commands that start with a
":"; these are sometimes referred to as Ex commands or command-line commands).
   Syntax files are also Vim scripts.  As are files that set options for a
specific file type.  A complicated macro can be defined by a separate Vim
script file.  You can think of other uses yourself.

Let's start with a simple example: >

	:let i = 1
	:while i < 5
	:  echo "count is" i
	:  let i += 1
	:endwhile
<
	Note:
	The ":" characters are not really needed here.  You only need to use
	them when you type a command.  In a Vim script file they can be left
	out.  We will use them here anyway to make clear these are colon
	commands and make them stand out from Normal mode commands.
	Note:
	You can try out the examples by yanking the lines from the text here
	and executing them with :@"

The output of the example code is:

	count is 1 ~
	count is 2 ~
	count is 3 ~
	count is 4 ~

In the first line the ":let" command assigns a value to a variable.  The
generic form is: >

	:let {variable} = {expression}

In this case the variable name is "i" and the expression is a simple value,
the number one.
   The ":while" command starts a loop.  The generic form is: >

	:while {condition}
	:  {statements}
	:endwhile

The statements until the matching ":endwhile" are executed for as long as the
condition is true.  The condition used here is the expression "i < 5".  This
is true when the variable i is smaller than five.
	Note:
	If you happen to write a while loop that keeps on running, you can
	interrupt it by pressing CTRL-C (CTRL-Break on MS-Windows).

The ":echo" command prints its arguments.  In this case the string "count is"
and the value of the variable i.  Since i is one, this will print:

	count is 1 ~

Then there is the ":let i += 1" command.  This does the same thing as
":let i = i + 1".  This adds one to the variable i and assigns the new value
to the same variable.

The example was given to explain the commands, but would you really want to
make such a loop it can be written much more compact: >

	:for i in range(1, 4)
	:  echo "count is" i
	:endfor

We won't explain how |:for| and |range()| work until later.  Follow the links
if you are impatient.


THREE KINDS OF NUMBERS

Numbers can be decimal, hexadecimal or octal.  A hexadecimal number starts
with "0x" or "0X".  For example "0x1f" is decimal 31.  An octal number starts
with a zero.  "017" is decimal 15.  Careful: don't put a zero before a decimal
number, it will be interpreted as an octal number!
   The ":echo" command always prints decimal numbers.  Example: >

	:echo 0x7f 036
<	127 30 ~

A number is made negative with a minus sign.  This also works for hexadecimal
and octal numbers.   A minus sign is also used for subtraction.  Compare this
with the previous example: >

	:echo 0x7f -036
<	97 ~

White space in an expression is ignored.  However, it's recommended to use it
for separating items, to make the expression easier to read.  For example, to
avoid the confusion with a negative number above, put a space between the
minus sign and the following number: >

	:echo 0x7f - 036

==============================================================================
*41.2*	Variables

A variable name consists of ASCII letters, digits and the underscore.  It
cannot start with a digit.  Valid variable names are:

	counter
	_aap3
	very_long_variable_name_with_underscores
	FuncLength
	LENGTH

Invalid names are "foo+bar" and "6var".
   These variables are global.  To see a list of currently defined variables
use this command: >

	:let

You can use global variables everywhere.  This also means that when the
variable "count" is used in one script file, it might also be used in another
file.  This leads to confusion at least, and real problems at worst.  To avoid
this, you can use a variable local to a script file by prepending "s:".  For
example, one script contains this code: >

	:let s:count = 1
	:while s:count < 5
	:  source other.vim
	:  let s:count += 1
	:endwhile

Since "s:count" is local to this script, you can be sure that sourcing the
"other.vim" script will not change this variable.  If "other.vim" also uses an
"s:count" variable, it will be a different copy, local to that script.  More
about script-local variables here: |script-variable|.

There are more kinds of variables, see |internal-variables|.  The most often
used ones are:

	b:name		variable local to a buffer
	w:name		variable local to a window
	g:name		global variable (also in a function)
	v:name		variable predefined by Vim


DELETING VARIABLES

Variables take up memory and show up in the output of the ":let" command.  To
delete a variable use the ":unlet" command.  Example: >

	:unlet s:count

This deletes the script-local variable "s:count" to free up the memory it
uses.  If you are not sure if the variable exists, and don't want an error
message when it doesn't, append !: >

	:unlet! s:count

When a script finishes, the local variables used there will not be
automatically freed.  The next time the script executes, it can still use the
old value.  Example: >

	:if !exists("s:call_count")
	:  let s:call_count = 0
	:endif
	:let s:call_count = s:call_count + 1
	:echo "called" s:call_count "times"

The "exists()" function checks if a variable has already been defined.  Its
argument is the name of the variable you want to check.  Not the variable
itself!  If you would do this: >

	:if !exists(s:call_count)

Then the value of s:call_count will be used as the name of the variable that
exists() checks.  That's not what you want.
   The exclamation mark ! negates a value.  When the value was true, it
becomes false.  When it was false, it becomes true.  You can read it as "not".
Thus "if !exists()" can be read as "if not exists()".
   What Vim calls true is anything that is not zero.  Zero is false.
	Note:
	Vim automatically converts a string to a number when it is looking for
	a number.  When using a string that doesn't start with a digit the
	resulting number is zero.  Thus look out for this: >
		:if "true"
<	The "true" will be interpreted as a zero, thus as false!


STRING VARIABLES AND CONSTANTS

So far only numbers were used for the variable value.  Strings can be used as
well.  Numbers and strings are the basic types of variables that Vim supports.
The type is dynamic, it is set each time when assigning a value to the
variable with ":let".  More about types in |41.8|.
   To assign a string value to a variable, you need to use a string constant.
There are two types of these.  First the string in double quotes: >

	:let name = "peter"
	:echo name
<	peter ~

If you want to include a double quote inside the string, put a backslash in
front of it: >

	:let name = "\"peter\""
	:echo name
<	"peter" ~

To avoid the need for a backslash, you can use a string in single quotes: >

	:let name = '"peter"'
	:echo name
<	"peter" ~

Inside a single-quote string all the characters are as they are.  Only the
single quote itself is special: you need to use two to get one.  A backslash
is taken literally, thus you can't use it to change the meaning of the
character after it.
   In double-quote strings it is possible to use special characters.  Here are
a few useful ones:

	\t		<Tab>
	\n		<NL>, line break
	\r		<CR>, <Enter>
	\e		<Esc>
	\b		<BS>, backspace
	\"		"
	\\		\, backslash
	\<Esc>		<Esc>
	\<C-W>		CTRL-W

The last two are just examples.  The  "\<name>" form can be used to include
the special key "name".
   See |expr-quote| for the full list of special items in a string.

==============================================================================
*41.3*	Expressions

Vim has a rich, yet simple way to handle expressions.  You can read the
definition here: |expression-syntax|.  Here we will show the most common
items.
   The numbers, strings and variables mentioned above are expressions by
themselves.  Thus everywhere an expression is expected, you can use a number,
string or variable.  Other basic items in an expression are:

	$NAME		environment variable
	&name		option
	@r		register

Examples: >

	:echo "The value of 'tabstop' is" &ts
	:echo "Your home directory is" $HOME
	:if @a > 5

The &name form can be used to save an option value, set it to a new value,
do something and restore the old value.  Example: >

	:let save_ic = &ic
	:set noic
	:/The Start/,$delete
	:let &ic = save_ic

This makes sure the "The Start" pattern is used with the 'ignorecase' option
off.  Still, it keeps the value that the user had set.  (Another way to do
this would be to add "\C" to the pattern, see |/\C|.)


MATHEMATICS

It becomes more interesting if we combine these basic items.  Let's start with
mathematics on numbers:

	a + b		add
	a - b		subtract
	a * b		multiply
	a / b		divide
	a % b		modulo

The usual precedence is used.  Example: >

	:echo 10 + 5 * 2
<	20 ~

Grouping is done with parentheses.  No surprises here.  Example: >

	:echo (10 + 5) * 2
<	30 ~

Strings can be concatenated with ".".  Example: >

	:echo "foo" . "bar"
<	foobar ~

When the ":echo" command gets multiple arguments, it separates them with a
space.  In the example the argument is a single expression, thus no space is
inserted.

Borrowed from the C language is the conditional expression:

	a ? b : c

If "a" evaluates to true "b" is used, otherwise "c" is used.  Example: >

	:let i = 4
	:echo i > 5 ? "i is big" : "i is small"
<	i is small ~

The three parts of the constructs are always evaluated first, thus you could
see it work as:

	(a) ? (b) : (c)

==============================================================================
*41.4*	Conditionals

The ":if" commands executes the following statements, until the matching
":endif", only when a condition is met.  The generic form is:

	:if {condition}
	   {statements}
	:endif

Only when the expression {condition} evaluates to true (non-zero) will the
{statements} be executed.  These must still be valid commands.  If they
contain garbage, Vim won't be able to find the ":endif".
   You can also use ":else".  The generic form for this is:

	:if {condition}
	   {statements}
	:else
	   {statements}
	:endif

The second {statements} is only executed if the first one isn't.
   Finally, there is ":elseif":

	:if {condition}
	   {statements}
	:elseif {condition}
	   {statements}
	:endif

This works just like using ":else" and then "if", but without the need for an
extra ":endif".
   A useful example for your vimrc file is checking the 'term' option and
doing something depending upon its value: >

	:if &term == "xterm"
	:  " Do stuff for xterm
	:elseif &term == "vt100"
	:  " Do stuff for a vt100 terminal
	:else
	:  " Do something for other terminals
	:endif


LOGIC OPERATIONS

We already used some of them in the examples.  These are the most often used
ones:

	a == b		equal to
	a != b		not equal to
	a >  b		greater than
	a >= b		greater than or equal to
	a <  b		less than
	a <= b		less than or equal to

The result is one if the condition is met and zero otherwise.  An example: >

	:if v:version >= 700
	:  echo "congratulations"
	:else
	:  echo "you are using an old version, upgrade!"
	:endif

Here "v:version" is a variable defined by Vim, which has the value of the Vim
version.  600 is for version 6.0.  Version 6.1 has the value 601.  This is
very useful to write a script that works with multiple versions of Vim.
|v:version|

The logic operators work both for numbers and strings.  When comparing two
strings, the mathematical difference is used.  This compares byte values,
which may not be right for some languages.
   When comparing a string with a number, the string is first converted to a
number.  This is a bit tricky, because when a string doesn't look like a
number, the number zero is used.  Example: >

	:if 0 == "one"
	:  echo "yes"
	:endif

This will echo "yes", because "one" doesn't look like a number, thus it is
converted to the number zero.

For strings there are two more items:

	a =~ b		matches with
	a !~ b		does not match with

The left item "a" is used as a string.  The right item "b" is used as a
pattern, like what's used for searching.  Example: >

	:if str =~ " "
	:  echo "str contains a space"
	:endif
	:if str !~ '\.$'
	:  echo "str does not end in a full stop"
	:endif

Notice the use of a single-quote string for the pattern.  This is useful,
because backslashes would need to be doubled in a double-quote string and
patterns tend to contain many backslashes.

The 'ignorecase' option is used when comparing strings.  When you don't want
that, append "#" to match case and "?" to ignore case.  Thus "==?" compares
two strings to be equal while ignoring case.  And "!~#" checks if a pattern
doesn't match, also checking the case of letters.  For the full table see
|expr-==|.


MORE LOOPING

The ":while" command was already mentioned.  Two more statements can be used
in between the ":while" and the ":endwhile":

	:continue		Jump back to the start of the while loop; the
				loop continues.
	:break			Jump forward to the ":endwhile"; the loop is
				discontinued.

Example: >

	:while counter < 40
	:  call do_something()
	:  if skip_flag
	:    continue
	:  endif
	:  if finished_flag
	:    break
	:  endif
	:  sleep 50m
	:endwhile

The ":sleep" command makes Vim take a nap.  The "50m" specifies fifty
milliseconds.  Another example is ":sleep 4", which sleeps for four seconds.

Even more looping can be done with the ":for" command, see below in |41.8|.

==============================================================================
*41.5*	Executing an expression

So far the commands in the script were executed by Vim directly.  The
":execute" command allows executing the result of an expression.  This is a
very powerful way to build commands and execute them.
   An example is to jump to a tag, which is contained in a variable: >

	:execute "tag " . tag_name

The "." is used to concatenate the string "tag " with the value of variable
"tag_name".  Suppose "tag_name" has the value "get_cmd", then the command that
will be executed is: >

	:tag get_cmd

The ":execute" command can only execute colon commands.  The ":normal" command
executes Normal mode commands.  However, its argument is not an expression but
the literal command characters.  Example: >

	:normal gg=G

This jumps to the first line and formats all lines with the "=" operator.
   To make ":normal" work with an expression, combine ":execute" with it.
Example: >

	:execute "normal " . normal_commands

The variable "normal_commands" must contain the Normal mode commands.
   Make sure that the argument for ":normal" is a complete command.  Otherwise
Vim will run into the end of the argument and abort the command.  For example,
if you start Insert mode, you must leave Insert mode as well.  This works: >

	:execute "normal Inew text \<Esc>"

This inserts "new text " in the current line.  Notice the use of the special
key "\<Esc>".  This avoids having to enter a real <Esc> character in your
script.

If you don't want to execute a string but evaluate it to get its expression
value, you can use the eval() function: >

	:let optname = "path"
	:let optval = eval('&' . optname)

A "&" character is prepended to "path", thus the argument to eval() is
"&path".  The result will then be the value of the 'path' option.
   The same thing can be done with: >
	:exe 'let optval = &' . optname

==============================================================================
*41.6*	Using functions

Vim defines many functions and provides a large amount of functionality that
way.  A few examples will be given in this section.  You can find the whole
list here: |functions|.

A function is called with the ":call" command.  The parameters are passed in
between parentheses separated by commas.  Example: >

	:call search("Date: ", "W")

This calls the search() function, with arguments "Date: " and "W".  The
search() function uses its first argument as a search pattern and the second
one as flags.  The "W" flag means the search doesn't wrap around the end of
the file.

A function can be called in an expression.  Example: >

	:let line = getline(".")
	:let repl = substitute(line, '\a', "*", "g")
	:call setline(".", repl)

The getline() function obtains a line from the current buffer.  Its argument
is a specification of the line number.  In this case "." is used, which means
the line where the cursor is.
   The substitute() function does something similar to the ":substitute"
command.  The first argument is the string on which to perform the
substitution.  The second argument is the pattern, the third the replacement
string.  Finally, the last arguments are the flags.
   The setline() function sets the line, specified by the first argument, to a
new string, the second argument.  In this example the line under the cursor is
replaced with the result of the substitute().  Thus the effect of the three
statements is equal to: >

	:substitute/\a/*/g

Using the functions becomes more interesting when you do more work before and
after the substitute() call.

==============================================================================
*41.7*	Defining a function

Vim enables you to define your own functions.  The basic function declaration
begins as follows: >

	:function {name}({var1}, {var2}, ...)
	:  {body}
	:endfunction
<
	Note:
	Function names must begin with a capital letter.

Let's define a short function to return the smaller of two numbers.  It starts
with this line: >

	:function Min(num1, num2)

This tells Vim that the function is named "Min" and it takes two arguments:
"num1" and "num2".
   The first thing you need to do is to check to see which number is smaller:
   >
	:  if a:num1 < a:num2

The special prefix "a:" tells Vim that the variable is a function argument.
Let's assign the variable "smaller" the value of the smallest number: >

	:  if a:num1 < a:num2
	:    let smaller = a:num1
	:  else
	:    let smaller = a:num2
	:  endif

The variable "smaller" is a local variable.  Variables used inside a function
are local unless prefixed by something like "g:", "a:", or "s:".

	Note:
	To access a global variable from inside a function you must prepend
	"g:" to it.  Thus "g:today" inside a function is used for the global
	variable "today", and "today" is another variable, local to the
	function.

You now use the ":return" statement to return the smallest number to the user.
Finally, you end the function: >

	:  return smaller
	:endfunction

The complete function definition is as follows: >

	:function Min(num1, num2)
	:  if a:num1 < a:num2
	:    let smaller = a:num1
	:  else
	:    let smaller = a:num2
	:  endif
	:  return smaller
	:endfunction

For people who like short functions, this does the same thing: >

	:function Min(num1, num2)
	:  if a:num1 < a:num2
	:    return a:num1
	:  endif
	:  return a:num2
	:endfunction

A user defined function is called in exactly the same way as a built-in
function.  Only the name is different.  The Min function can be used like
this: >

	:echo Min(5, 8)

Only now will the function be executed and the lines be interpreted by Vim.
If there are mistakes, like using an undefined variable or function, you will
now get an error message.  When defining the function these errors are not
detected.

When a function reaches ":endfunction" or ":return" is used without an
argument, the function returns zero.

To redefine a function that already exists, use the ! for the ":function"
command: >

	:function!  Min(num1, num2, num3)


USING A RANGE

The ":call" command can be given a line range.  This can have one of two
meanings.  When a function has been defined with the "range" keyword, it will
take care of the line range itself.
  The function will be passed the variables "a:firstline" and "a:lastline".
These will have the line numbers from the range the function was called with.
Example: >

	:function Count_words() range
	:  let lnum = a:firstline
	:  let n = 0
	:  while lnum <= a:lastline
	:    let n = n + len(split(getline(lnum)))
	:    let lnum = lnum + 1
	:  endwhile
	:  echo "found " . n . " words"
	:endfunction

You can call this function with: >

	:10,30call Count_words()

It will be executed once and echo the number of words.
   The other way to use a line range is by defining a function without the
"range" keyword.  The function will be called once for every line in the
range, with the cursor in that line.  Example: >

	:function  Number()
	:  echo "line " . line(".") . " contains: " . getline(".")
	:endfunction

If you call this function with: >

	:10,15call Number()

The function will be called six times.


VARIABLE NUMBER OF ARGUMENTS

Vim enables you to define functions that have a variable number of arguments.
The following command, for instance, defines a function that must have 1
argument (start) and can have up to 20 additional arguments: >

	:function Show(start, ...)

The variable "a:1" contains the first optional argument, "a:2" the second, and
so on.  The variable "a:0" contains the number of extra arguments.
   For example: >

	:function Show(start, ...)
	:  echohl Title
	:  echo "start is " . a:start
	:  echohl None
	:  let index = 1
	:  while index <= a:0
	:    echo "  Arg " . index . " is " . a:{index}
	:    let index = index + 1
	:  endwhile
	:  echo ""
	:endfunction

This uses the ":echohl" command to specify the highlighting used for the
following ":echo" command.  ":echohl None" stops it again.  The ":echon"
command works like ":echo", but doesn't output a line break.

You can also use the a:000 variable, it is a List of all the "..." arguments.
See |a:000|.


LISTING FUNCTIONS

The ":function" command lists the names and arguments of all user-defined
functions: >

	:function
<	function Show(start, ...) ~
	function GetVimIndent() ~
	function SetSyn(name) ~

To see what a function does, use its name as an argument for ":function": >

	:function SetSyn
<	1     if &syntax == '' ~
	2       let &syntax = a:name ~
	3     endif ~
	   endfunction ~


DEBUGGING

The line number is useful for when you get an error message or when debugging.
See |debug-scripts| about debugging mode.
   You can also set the 'verbose' option to 12 or higher to see all function
calls.  Set it to 15 or higher to see every executed line.


DELETING A FUNCTION

To delete the Show() function: >

	:delfunction Show

You get an error when the function doesn't exist.


FUNCTION REFERENCES

Sometimes it can be useful to have a variable point to one function or
another.  You can do it with the function() function.  It turns the name of a
function into a reference: >

	:let result = 0		" or 1
	:function! Right()
	:  return 'Right!'
	:endfunc
	:function! Wrong()
	:  return 'Wrong!'
	:endfunc
	:
	:if result == 1
	:  let Afunc = function('Right')
	:else
	:  let Afunc = function('Wrong')
	:endif
	:echo call(Afunc, [])
<	Wrong! ~

Note that the name of a variable that holds a function reference must start
with a capital.  Otherwise it could be confused with the name of a builtin
function.
   The way to invoke a function that a variable refers to is with the call()
function.  Its first argument is the function reference, the second argument
is a List with arguments.

Function references are most useful in combination with a Dictionary, as is
explained in the next section.

==============================================================================
*41.8*	Lists and Dictionaries

So far we have used the basic types String and Number.  Vim also supports two
composite types: List and Dictionary.

A List is an ordered sequence of things.  The things can be any kind of value,
thus you can make a List of numbers, a List of Lists and even a List of mixed
items.  To create a List with three strings: >

	:let alist = ['aap', 'mies', 'noot']

The List items are enclosed in square brackets and separated by commas.  To
create an empty List: >

	:let alist = []

You can add items to a List with the add() function: >

	:let alist = []
	:call add(alist, 'foo')
	:call add(alist, 'bar')
	:echo alist
<	['foo', 'bar'] ~

List concatenation is done with +: >

	:echo alist + ['foo', 'bar']
<	['foo', 'bar', 'foo', 'bar'] ~

Or, if you want to extend a List directly: >

	:let alist = ['one']
	:call extend(alist, ['two', 'three'])
	:echo alist
<	['one', 'two', 'three'] ~

Notice that using add() will have a different effect: >

	:let alist = ['one']
	:call add(alist, ['two', 'three'])
	:echo alist
<	['one', ['two', 'three']] ~

The second argument of add() is added as a single item.


FOR LOOP

One of the nice things you can do with a List is iterate over it: >

	:let alist = ['one', 'two', 'three']
	:for n in alist
	:  echo n
	:endfor
<	one ~
	two ~
	three ~

This will loop over each element in List "alist", assigning the value to
variable "n".  The generic form of a for loop is: >

	:for {varname} in {listexpression}
	:  {commands}
	:endfor

To loop a certain number of times you need a List of a specific length.  The
range() function creates one for you: >

	:for a in range(3)
	:  echo a
	:endfor
<	0 ~
	1 ~
	2 ~

Notice that the first item of the List that range() produces is zero, thus the
last item is one less than the length of the list.
   You can also specify the maximum value, the stride and even go backwards: >

	:for a in range(8, 4, -2)
	:  echo a
	:endfor
<	8 ~
	6 ~
	4 ~

A more useful example, looping over lines in the buffer: >

	:for line in getline(1, 20)
	:  if line =~ "Date: "
	:    echo matchstr(line, 'Date: \zs.*')
	:  endif
	:endfor

This looks into lines 1 to 20 (inclusive) and echoes any date found in there.


DICTIONARIES

A Dictionary stores key-value pairs.  You can quickly lookup a value if you
know the key.  A Dictionary is created with curly braces: >

	:let uk2nl = {'one': 'een', 'two': 'twee', 'three': 'drie'}

Now you can lookup words by putting the key in square brackets: >

	:echo uk2nl['two']
<	twee ~

The generic form for defining a Dictionary is: >

	{<key> : <value>, ...}

An empty Dictionary is one without any keys: >

	{}

The possibilities with Dictionaries are numerous.  There are various functions
for them as well.  For example, you can obtain a list of the keys and loop
over them: >

	:for key in keys(uk2nl)
	:  echo key
	:endfor
<	three ~
	one ~
	two ~

You will notice the keys are not ordered.  You can sort the list to get a
specific order: >

	:for key in sort(keys(uk2nl))
	:  echo key
	:endfor
<	one ~
	three ~
	two ~

But you can never get back the order in which items are defined.  For that you
need to use a List, it stores items in an ordered sequence.


DICTIONARY FUNCTIONS

The items in a Dictionary can normally be obtained with an index in square
brackets: >

	:echo uk2nl['one']
<	een ~

A method that does the same, but without so many punctuation characters: >

	:echo uk2nl.one
<	een ~

This only works for a key that is made of ASCII letters, digits and the
underscore.  You can also assign a new value this way: >

	:let uk2nl.four = 'vier'
	:echo uk2nl
<	{'three': 'drie', 'four': 'vier', 'one': 'een', 'two': 'twee'} ~

And now for something special: you can directly define a function and store a
reference to it in the dictionary: >

	:function uk2nl.translate(line) dict
	:  return join(map(split(a:line), 'get(self, v:val, "???")'))
	:endfunction

Let's first try it out: >

	:echo uk2nl.translate('three two five one')
<	drie twee ??? een ~

The first special thing you notice is the "dict" at the end of the ":function"
line.  This marks the function as being used from a Dictionary.  The "self"
local variable will then refer to that Dictionary.
   Now let's break up the complicated return command: >

	split(a:line)

The split() function takes a string, chops it into whitespace separated words
and returns a list with these words.  Thus in the example it returns: >

	:echo split('three two five one')
<	['three', 'two', 'five', 'one'] ~

This list is the first argument to the map() function.  This will go through
the list, evaluating its second argument with "v:val" set to the value of each
item.  This is a shortcut to using a for loop.  This command: >

	:let alist = map(split(a:line), 'get(self, v:val, "???")')

Is equivalent to: >

	:let alist = split(a:line)
	:for idx in range(len(alist))
	:  let alist[idx] = get(self, alist[idx], "???")
	:endfor

The get() function checks if a key is present in a Dictionary.  If it is, then
the value is retrieved.  If it isn't, then the default value is returned, in
the example it's '???'.  This is a convenient way to handle situations where a
key may not be present and you don't want an error message.

The join() function does the opposite of split(): it joins together a list of
words, putting a space in between.
  This combination of split(), map() and join() is a nice way to filter a line
of words in a very compact way.


OBJECT ORIENTED PROGRAMMING

Now that you can put both values and functions in a Dictionary, you can
actually use a Dictionary like an object.
   Above we used a Dictionary for translating Dutch to English.  We might want
to do the same for other languages.  Let's first make an object (aka
Dictionary) that has the translate function, but no words to translate: >

	:let transdict = {}
	:function transdict.translate(line) dict
	:  return join(map(split(a:line), 'get(self.words, v:val, "???")'))
	:endfunction

It's slightly different from the function above, using 'self.words' to lookup
word translations.  But we don't have a self.words.  Thus you could call this
an abstract class.

Now we can instantiate a Dutch translation object: >

	:let uk2nl = copy(transdict)
	:let uk2nl.words = {'one': 'een', 'two': 'twee', 'three': 'drie'}
	:echo uk2nl.translate('three one')
<	drie een ~

And a German translator: >

	:let uk2de = copy(transdict)
	:let uk2de.words = {'one': 'ein', 'two': 'zwei', 'three': 'drei'}
	:echo uk2de.translate('three one')
<	drei ein ~

You see that the copy() function is used to make a copy of the "transdict"
Dictionary and then the copy is changed to add the words.  The original
remains the same, of course.

Now you can go one step further, and use your preferred translator: >

	:if $LANG =~ "de"
	:  let trans = uk2de
	:else
	:  let trans = uk2nl
	:endif
	:echo trans.translate('one two three')
<	een twee drie ~

Here "trans" refers to one of the two objects (Dictionaries).  No copy is
made.  More about List and Dictionary identity can be found at |list-identity|
and |dict-identity|.

Now you might use a language that isn't supported.  You can overrule the
translate() function to do nothing: >

	:let uk2uk = copy(transdict)
	:function! uk2uk.translate(line)
	:  return a:line
	:endfunction
	:echo uk2uk.translate('three one wladiwostok')
<	three one wladiwostok ~

Notice that a ! was used to overwrite the existing function reference.  Now
use "uk2uk" when no recognized language is found: >

	:if $LANG =~ "de"
	:  let trans = uk2de
	:elseif $LANG =~ "nl"
	:  let trans = uk2nl
	:else
	:  let trans = uk2uk
	:endif
	:echo trans.translate('one two three')
<	one two three ~

For further reading see |Lists| and |Dictionaries|.

==============================================================================
*41.9*	Exceptions

Let's start with an example: >

	:try
	:   read ~/templates/pascal.tmpl
	:catch /E484:/
	:   echo "Sorry, the Pascal template file cannot be found."
	:endtry

The ":read" command will fail if the file does not exist.  Instead of
generating an error message, this code catches the error and gives the user a
nice message.

For the commands in between ":try" and ":endtry" errors are turned into
exceptions.  An exception is a string.  In the case of an error the string
contains the error message.  And every error message has a number.  In this
case, the error we catch contains "E484:".  This number is guaranteed to stay
the same (the text may change, e.g., it may be translated).

When the ":read" command causes another error, the pattern "E484:" will not
match in it.  Thus this exception will not be caught and result in the usual
error message.

You might be tempted to do this: >

	:try
	:   read ~/templates/pascal.tmpl
	:catch
	:   echo "Sorry, the Pascal template file cannot be found."
	:endtry

This means all errors are caught.  But then you will not see errors that are
useful, such as "E21: Cannot make changes, 'modifiable' is off".

Another useful mechanism is the ":finally" command: >

	:let tmp = tempname()
	:try
	:   exe ".,$write " . tmp
	:   exe "!filter " . tmp
	:   .,$delete
	:   exe "$read " . tmp
	:finally
	:   call delete(tmp)
	:endtry

This filters the lines from the cursor until the end of the file through the
"filter" command, which takes a file name argument.  No matter if the
filtering works, something goes wrong in between ":try" and ":finally" or the
user cancels the filtering by pressing CTRL-C, the "call delete(tmp)" is
always executed.  This makes sure you don't leave the temporary file behind.

More information about exception handling can be found in the reference
manual: |exception-handling|.

==============================================================================
*41.10*	Various remarks

Here is a summary of items that apply to Vim scripts.  They are also mentioned
elsewhere, but form a nice checklist.

The end-of-line character depends on the system.  For Unix a single <NL>
character is used.  For MS-DOS, Windows, OS/2 and the like, <CR><LF> is used.
This is important when using mappings that end in a <CR>.  See |:source_crnl|.


WHITE SPACE

Blank lines are allowed and ignored.

Leading whitespace characters (blanks and TABs) are always ignored.  The
whitespaces between parameters (e.g. between the 'set' and the 'cpoptions' in
the example below) are reduced to one blank character and plays the role of a
separator, the whitespaces after the last (visible) character may or may not
be ignored depending on the situation, see below.

For a ":set" command involving the "=" (equal) sign, such as in: >

	:set cpoptions    =aABceFst

the whitespace immediately before the "=" sign is ignored.  But there can be
no whitespace after the "=" sign!

To include a whitespace character in the value of an option, it must be
escaped by a "\" (backslash)  as in the following example: >

	:set tags=my\ nice\ file

The same example written as: >

	:set tags=my nice file

will issue an error, because it is interpreted as: >

	:set tags=my
	:set nice
	:set file


COMMENTS

The character " (the double quote mark) starts a comment.  Everything after
and including this character until the end-of-line is considered a comment and
is ignored, except for commands that don't consider comments, as shown in
examples below.  A comment can start on any character position on the line.

There is a little "catch" with comments for some commands.  Examples: >

	:abbrev dev development		" shorthand
	:map <F3> o#include		" insert include
	:execute cmd			" do it
	:!ls *.c			" list C files

The abbreviation 'dev' will be expanded to 'development     " shorthand'.  The
mapping of <F3> will actually be the whole line after the 'o# ....' including
the '" insert include'.  The "execute" command will give an error.  The "!"
command will send everything after it to the shell, causing an error for an
unmatched '"' character.
   There can be no comment after ":map", ":abbreviate", ":execute" and "!"
commands (there are a few more commands with this restriction).  For the
":map", ":abbreviate" and ":execute" commands there is a trick: >

	:abbrev dev development|" shorthand
	:map <F3> o#include|" insert include
	:execute cmd			|" do it

With the '|' character the command is separated from the next one.  And that
next command is only a comment.  For the last command you need to do two
things: |:execute| and use '|': >
	:exe '!ls *.c'			|" list C files

Notice that there is no white space before the '|' in the abbreviation and
mapping.  For these commands, any character until the end-of-line or '|' is
included.  As a consequence of this behavior, you don't always see that
trailing whitespace is included: >

	:map <F4> o#include  

To spot these problems, you can set the 'list' option when editing vimrc
files.

For Unix there is one special way to comment a line, that allows making a Vim
script executable: >
	#!/usr/bin/env vim -S
	echo "this is a Vim script"
	quit

The "#" command by itself lists a line with the line number.  Adding an
exclamation mark changes it into doing nothing, so that you can add the shell
command to execute the rest of the file. |:#!| |-S|


PITFALLS

Even bigger problem arises in the following example: >

	:map ,ab o#include
	:unmap ,ab 

Here the unmap command will not work, because it tries to unmap ",ab ".  This
does not exist as a mapped sequence.  An error will be issued, which is very
hard to identify, because the ending whitespace character in ":unmap ,ab " is
not visible.

And this is the same as what happens when one uses a comment after an 'unmap'
command: >

	:unmap ,ab     " comment

Here the comment part will be ignored.  However, Vim will try to unmap
',ab     ', which does not exist.  Rewrite it as: >

	:unmap ,ab|    " comment


RESTORING THE VIEW

Sometimes you want to make a change and go back to where the cursor was.
Restoring the relative position would also be nice, so that the same line
appears at the top of the window.
   This example yanks the current line, puts it above the first line in the
file and then restores the view: >

	map ,p ma"aYHmbgg"aP`bzt`a

What this does: >
	ma"aYHmbgg"aP`bzt`a
<	ma			set mark a at cursor position
	  "aY			yank current line into register a
	     Hmb		go to top line in window and set mark b there
		gg		go to first line in file
		  "aP		put the yanked line above it
		     `b		go back to top line in display
		       zt	position the text in the window as before
			 `a	go back to saved cursor position


PACKAGING

To avoid your function names to interfere with functions that you get from
others, use this scheme:
- Prepend a unique string before each function name.  I often use an
  abbreviation.  For example, "OW_" is used for the option window functions.
- Put the definition of your functions together in a file.  Set a global
  variable to indicate that the functions have been loaded.  When sourcing the
  file again, first unload the functions.
Example: >

	" This is the XXX package

	if exists("XXX_loaded")
	  delfun XXX_one
	  delfun XXX_two
	endif

	function XXX_one(a)
		... body of function ...
	endfun

	function XXX_two(b)
		... body of function ...
	endfun

	let XXX_loaded = 1

==============================================================================
*41.11*	Writing a plugin				*write-plugin*

You can write a Vim script in such a way that many people can use it.  This is
called a plugin.  Vim users can drop your script in their plugin directory and
use its features right away |add-plugin|.

There are actually two types of plugins:

  global plugins: For all types of files.
filetype plugins: Only for files of a specific type.

In this section the first type is explained.  Most items are also relevant for
writing filetype plugins.  The specifics for filetype plugins are in the next
section |write-filetype-plugin|.


NAME

First of all you must choose a name for your plugin.  The features provided
by the plugin should be clear from its name.  And it should be unlikely that
someone else writes a plugin with the same name but which does something
different.  And please limit the name to 8 characters, to avoid problems on
old Windows systems.

A script that corrects typing mistakes could be called "typecorr.vim".  We
will use it here as an example.

For the plugin to work for everybody, it should follow a few guidelines.  This
will be explained step-by-step.  The complete example plugin is at the end.


BODY

Let's start with the body of the plugin, the lines that do the actual work: >

 14	iabbrev teh the
 15	iabbrev otehr other
 16	iabbrev wnat want
 17	iabbrev synchronisation
 18		\ synchronization
 19	let s:count = 4

The actual list should be much longer, of course.

The line numbers have only been added to explain a few things, don't put them
in your plugin file!


HEADER

You will probably add new corrections to the plugin and soon have several
versions lying around.  And when distributing this file, people will want to
know who wrote this wonderful plugin and where they can send remarks.
Therefore, put a header at the top of your plugin: >

  1	" Vim global plugin for correcting typing mistakes
  2	" Last Change:	2000 Oct 15
  3	" Maintainer:	Bram Moolenaar <Bram@vim.org>

About copyright and licensing: Since plugins are very useful and it's hardly
worth restricting their distribution, please consider making your plugin
either public domain or use the Vim |license|.  A short note about this near
the top of the plugin should be sufficient.  Example: >

  4	" License:	This file is placed in the public domain.


LINE CONTINUATION, AVOIDING SIDE EFFECTS		*use-cpo-save*

In line 18 above, the line-continuation mechanism is used |line-continuation|.
Users with 'compatible' set will run into trouble here, they will get an error
message.  We can't just reset 'compatible', because that has a lot of side
effects.  To avoid this, we will set the 'cpoptions' option to its Vim default
value and restore it later.  That will allow the use of line-continuation and
make the script work for most people.  It is done like this: >

 11	let s:save_cpo = &cpo
 12	set cpo&vim
 ..
 42	let &cpo = s:save_cpo
 43	unlet s:save_cpo

We first store the old value of 'cpoptions' in the s:save_cpo variable.  At
the end of the plugin this value is restored.

Notice that a script-local variable is used |s:var|.  A global variable could
already be in use for something else.  Always use script-local variables for
things that are only used in the script.


NOT LOADING

It's possible that a user doesn't always want to load this plugin.  Or the
system administrator has dropped it in the system-wide plugin directory, but a
user has his own plugin he wants to use.  Then the user must have a chance to
disable loading this specific plugin.  This will make it possible: >

  6	if exists("g:loaded_typecorr")
  7	  finish
  8	endif
  9	let g:loaded_typecorr = 1

This also avoids that when the script is loaded twice it would cause error
messages for redefining functions and cause trouble for autocommands that are
added twice.

The name is recommended to start with "loaded_" and then the file name of the
plugin, literally.  The "g:" is prepended just to avoid mistakes when using
the variable in a function (without "g:" it would be a variable local to the
function).

Using "finish" stops Vim from reading the rest of the file, it's much quicker
than using if-endif around the whole file.


MAPPING

Now let's make the plugin more interesting: We will add a mapping that adds a
correction for the word under the cursor.  We could just pick a key sequence
for this mapping, but the user might already use it for something else.  To
allow the user to define which keys a mapping in a plugin uses, the <Leader>
item can be used: >

 22	  map <unique> <Leader>a  <Plug>TypecorrAdd

The "<Plug>TypecorrAdd" thing will do the work, more about that further on.

The user can set the "mapleader" variable to the key sequence that he wants
this mapping to start with.  Thus if the user has done: >

	let mapleader = "_"

the mapping will define "_a".  If the user didn't do this, the default value
will be used, which is a backslash.  Then a map for "\a" will be defined.

Note that <unique> is used, this will cause an error message if the mapping
already happened to exist. |:map-<unique>|

But what if the user wants to define his own key sequence?  We can allow that
with this mechanism: >

 21	if !hasmapto('<Plug>TypecorrAdd')
 22	  map <unique> <Leader>a  <Plug>TypecorrAdd
 23	endif

This checks if a mapping to "<Plug>TypecorrAdd" already exists, and only
defines the mapping from "<Leader>a" if it doesn't.  The user then has a
chance of putting this in his vimrc file: >

	map ,c  <Plug>TypecorrAdd

Then the mapped key sequence will be ",c" instead of "_a" or "\a".


PIECES

If a script gets longer, you often want to break up the work in pieces.  You
can use functions or mappings for this.  But you don't want these functions
and mappings to interfere with the ones from other scripts.  For example, you
could define a function Add(), but another script could try to define the same
function.  To avoid this, we define the function local to the script by
prepending it with "s:".

We will define a function that adds a new typing correction: >

 30	function s:Add(from, correct)
 31	  let to = input("type the correction for " . a:from . ": ")
 32	  exe ":iabbrev " . a:from . " " . to
 ..
 36	endfunction

Now we can call the function s:Add() from within this script.  If another
script also defines s:Add(), it will be local to that script and can only
be called from the script it was defined in.  There can also be a global Add()
function (without the "s:"), which is again another function.

<SID> can be used with mappings.  It generates a script ID, which identifies
the current script.  In our typing correction plugin we use it like this: >

 24	noremap <unique> <script> <Plug>TypecorrAdd  <SID>Add
 ..
 28	noremap <SID>Add  :call <SID>Add(expand("<cword>"), 1)<CR>

Thus when a user types "\a", this sequence is invoked: >

	\a  ->  <Plug>TypecorrAdd  ->  <SID>Add  ->  :call <SID>Add()

If another script would also map <SID>Add, it would get another script ID and
thus define another mapping.

Note that instead of s:Add() we use <SID>Add() here.  That is because the
mapping is typed by the user, thus outside of the script.  The <SID> is
translated to the script ID, so that Vim knows in which script to look for
the Add() function.

This is a bit complicated, but it's required for the plugin to work together
with other plugins.  The basic rule is that you use <SID>Add() in mappings and
s:Add() in other places (the script itself, autocommands, user commands).

We can also add a menu entry to do the same as the mapping: >

 26	noremenu <script> Plugin.Add\ Correction      <SID>Add

The "Plugin" menu is recommended for adding menu items for plugins.  In this
case only one item is used.  When adding more items, creating a submenu is
recommended.  For example, "Plugin.CVS" could be used for a plugin that offers
CVS operations "Plugin.CVS.checkin", "Plugin.CVS.checkout", etc.

Note that in line 28 ":noremap" is used to avoid that any other mappings cause
trouble.  Someone may have remapped ":call", for example.  In line 24 we also
use ":noremap", but we do want "<SID>Add" to be remapped.  This is why
"<script>" is used here.  This only allows mappings which are local to the
script. |:map-<script>|  The same is done in line 26 for ":noremenu".
|:menu-<script>|


<SID> AND <Plug>					*using-<Plug>*

Both <SID> and <Plug> are used to avoid that mappings of typed keys interfere
with mappings that are only to be used from other mappings.  Note the
difference between using <SID> and <Plug>:

<Plug>	is visible outside of the script.  It is used for mappings which the
	user might want to map a key sequence to.  <Plug> is a special code
	that a typed key will never produce.
	To make it very unlikely that other plugins use the same sequence of
	characters, use this structure: <Plug> scriptname mapname
	In our example the scriptname is "Typecorr" and the mapname is "Add".
	This results in "<Plug>TypecorrAdd".  Only the first character of
	scriptname and mapname is uppercase, so that we can see where mapname
	starts.

<SID>	is the script ID, a unique identifier for a script.
	Internally Vim translates <SID> to "<SNR>123_", where "123" can be any
	number.  Thus a function "<SID>Add()" will have a name "<SNR>11_Add()"
	in one script, and "<SNR>22_Add()" in another.  You can see this if
	you use the ":function" command to get a list of functions.  The
	translation of <SID> in mappings is exactly the same, that's how you
	can call a script-local function from a mapping.


USER COMMAND

Now let's add a user command to add a correction: >

 38	if !exists(":Correct")
 39	  command -nargs=1  Correct  :call s:Add(<q-args>, 0)
 40	endif

The user command is defined only if no command with the same name already
exists.  Otherwise we would get an error here.  Overriding the existing user
command with ":command!" is not a good idea, this would probably make the user
wonder why the command he defined himself doesn't work.  |:command|


SCRIPT VARIABLES

When a variable starts with "s:" it is a script variable.  It can only be used
inside a script.  Outside the script it's not visible.  This avoids trouble
with using the same variable name in different scripts.  The variables will be
kept as long as Vim is running.  And the same variables are used when sourcing
the same script again. |s:var|

The fun is that these variables can also be used in functions, autocommands
and user commands that are defined in the script.  In our example we can add
a few lines to count the number of corrections: >

 19	let s:count = 4
 ..
 30	function s:Add(from, correct)
 ..
 34	  let s:count = s:count + 1
 35	  echo s:count . " corrections now"
 36	endfunction

First s:count is initialized to 4 in the script itself.  When later the
s:Add() function is called, it increments s:count.  It doesn't matter from
where the function was called, since it has been defined in the script, it
will use the local variables from this script.


THE RESULT

Here is the resulting complete example: >

  1	" Vim global plugin for correcting typing mistakes
  2	" Last Change:	2000 Oct 15
  3	" Maintainer:	Bram Moolenaar <Bram@vim.org>
  4	" License:	This file is placed in the public domain.
  5
  6	if exists("g:loaded_typecorr")
  7	  finish
  8	endif
  9	let g:loaded_typecorr = 1

 25
 26	noremenu <script> Plugin.Add\ Correction      <SID>Add
 27
 28	noremap <SID>Add  :call <SID>Add(expand("<cword>"), 1)<CR>
 29
 30	function s:Add(from, correct)
 31	  let to = input("type the correction for " . a:from . ": ")
 32	  exe ":iabbrev " . a:from . " " . to
 33	  if a:correct | exe "normal viws\<C-R>\" \b\e" | endif
 34	  let s:count = s:count + 1
 35	  echo s:count . " corrections now"
 36	endfunction
 37
 38	if !exists(":Correct")
 39	  command -nargs=1  Correct  :call s:Add(<q-args>, 0)
 40	endif
 41
 42	let &cpo = s:save_cpo
 43	unlet s:save_cpo

Line 33 wasn't explained yet.  It applies the new correction to the word under
the cursor.  The |:normal| command is used to use the new abbreviation.  Note
that mappings and abbreviations are expanded here, even though the function
was called from a mapping defined with ":noremap".

Using "unix" for the 'fileformat' option is recommended.  The Vim scripts will
then work everywhere.  Scripts with 'fileformat' set to "dos" do not work on
Unix.  Also see |:source_crnl|.  To be sure it is set right, do this before
writing the file: >

	:set fileformat=unix


DOCUMENTATION						*write-local-help*

It's a good idea to also write some documentation for your plugin.  Especially
when its behavior can be changed by the user.  See |add-local-help| for how
they are installed.

Here is a simple example for a plugin help file, called "typecorr.txt": >

  1	*typecorr.txt*	Plugin for correcting typing mistakes
  2
  3	If you make typing mistakes, this plugin will have them corrected
  4	automatically.
  5
  6	There are currently only a few corrections.  Add your own if you like.
  7
  8	Mappings:
  9	<Leader>a   or   <Plug>TypecorrAdd
 10		Add a correction for the word under the cursor.
 11
 12	Commands:
 13	:Correct {word}
 14		Add a correction for {word}.
 15
 16							*typecorr-settings*
 17	This plugin doesn't have any settings.

The first line is actually the only one for which the format matters.  It will
be extracted from the help file to be put in the "LOCAL ADDITIONS:" section of
help.txt |local-additions|.  The first "*" must be in the first column of the
first line.  After adding your help file do ":help" and check that the entries
line up nicely.

You can add more tags inside ** in your help file.  But be careful not to use
existing help tags.  You would probably use the name of your plugin in most of
them, like "typecorr-settings" in the example.

Using references to other parts of the help in || is recommended.  This makes
it easy for the user to find associated help.


FILETYPE DETECTION					*plugin-filetype*

If your filetype is not already detected by Vim, you should create a filetype
detection snippet in a separate file.  It is usually in the form of an
autocommand that sets the filetype when the file name matches a pattern.
Example: >

	au BufNewFile,BufRead *.foo			set filetype=foofoo

Write this single-line file as "ftdetect/foofoo.vim" in the first directory
that appears in 'runtimepath'.  For Unix that would be
"~/.vim/ftdetect/foofoo.vim".  The convention is to use the name of the
filetype for the script name.

You can make more complicated checks if you like, for example to inspect the
contents of the file to recognize the language.  Also see |new-filetype|.


SUMMARY							*plugin-special*

Summary of special things to use in a plugin:

s:name			Variables local to the script.

<SID>			Script-ID, used for mappings and functions local to
			the script.

hasmapto()		Function to test if the user already defined a mapping
			for functionality the script offers.

<Leader>		Value of "mapleader", which the user defines as the
			keys that plugin mappings start with.

:map <unique>		Give a warning if a mapping already exists.

:noremap <script>	Use only mappings local to the script, not global
			mappings.

exists(":Cmd")		Check if a user command already exists.

==============================================================================
*41.12*	Writing a filetype plugin	*write-filetype-plugin* *ftplugin*

A filetype plugin is like a global plugin, except that it sets options and
defines mappings for the current buffer only.  See |add-filetype-plugin| for
how this type of plugin is used.

First read the section on global plugins above |41.11|.  All that is said there
also applies to filetype plugins.  There are a few extras, which are explained
here.  The essential thing is that a filetype plugin should only have an
effect on the current buffer.


DISABLING

If you are writing a filetype plugin to be used by many people, they need a
chance to disable loading it.  Put this at the top of the plugin: >

	" Only do this when not done yet for this buffer
	if exists("b:did_ftplugin")
	  finish
	endif
	let b:did_ftplugin = 1

This also needs to be used to avoid that the same plugin is executed twice for
the same buffer (happens when using an ":edit" command without arguments).

Now users can disable loading the default plugin completely by making a
filetype plugin with only this line: >

	let b:did_ftplugin = 1

This does require that the filetype plugin directory comes before $VIMRUNTIME
in 'runtimepath'!

If you do want to use the default plugin, but overrule one of the settings,
you can write the different setting in a script: >

	setlocal textwidth=70

Now write this in the "after" directory, so that it gets sourced after the
distributed "vim.vim" ftplugin |after-directory|.  For Unix this would be
"~/.vim/after/ftplugin/vim.vim".  Note that the default plugin will have set
"b:did_ftplugin", but it is ignored here.


OPTIONS

To make sure the filetype plugin only affects the current buffer use the >

	:setlocal

command to set options.  And only set options which are local to a buffer (see
the help for the option to check that).  When using |:setlocal| for global
options or options local to a window, the value will change for many buffers,
and that is not what a filetype plugin should do.

When an option has a value that is a list of flags or items, consider using
"+=" and "-=" to keep the existing value.  Be aware that the user may have
changed an option value already.  First resetting to the default value and
then changing it is often a good idea.  Example: >

	:setlocal formatoptions& formatoptions+=ro


MAPPINGS

To make sure mappings will only work in the current buffer use the >

	:map <buffer>

command.  This needs to be combined with the two-step mapping explained above.
An example of how to define functionality in a filetype plugin: >

	if !hasmapto('<Plug>JavaImport')
	  map <buffer> <unique> <LocalLeader>i <Plug>JavaImport
	endif
	noremap <buffer> <unique> <Plug>JavaImport oimport ""<Left><Esc>

|hasmapto()| is used to check if the user has already defined a map to
<Plug>JavaImport.  If not, then the filetype plugin defines the default
mapping.  This starts with |<LocalLeader>|, which allows the user to select
the key(s) he wants filetype plugin mappings to start with.  The default is a
backslash.
"<unique>" is used to give an error message if the mapping already exists or
overlaps with an existing mapping.
|:noremap| is used to avoid that any other mappings that the user has defined
interferes.  You might want to use ":noremap <script>" to allow remapping
mappings defined in this script that start with <SID>.

The user must have a chance to disable the mappings in a filetype plugin,
without disabling everything.  Here is an example of how this is done for a
plugin for the mail filetype: >

	" Add mappings, unless the user didn't want this.
	if !exists("no_plugin_maps") && !exists("no_mail_maps")
	  " Quote text by inserting "> "
	  if !hasmapto('<Plug>MailQuote')
	    vmap <buffer> <LocalLeader>q <Plug>MailQuote
	    nmap <buffer> <LocalLeader>q <Plug>MailQuote
	  endif
	  vnoremap <buffer> <Plug>MailQuote :s/^/> /<CR>
	  nnoremap <buffer> <Plug>MailQuote :.,$s/^/> /<CR>
	endif

Two global variables are used:
no_plugin_maps		disables mappings for all filetype plugins
no_mail_maps		disables mappings for a specific filetype


USER COMMANDS

To add a user command for a specific file type, so that it can only be used in
one buffer, use the "-buffer" argument to |:command|.  Example: >

	:command -buffer  Make  make %:r.s


VARIABLES

A filetype plugin will be sourced for each buffer of the type it's for.  Local
script variables |s:var| will be shared between all invocations.  Use local
buffer variables |b:var| if you want a variable specifically for one buffer.


FUNCTIONS

When defining a function, this only needs to be done once.  But the filetype
plugin will be sourced every time a file with this filetype will be opened.
This construct makes sure the function is only defined once: >

	:if !exists("*s:Func")
	:  function s:Func(arg)
	:    ...
	:  endfunction
	:endif
<

UNDO							*undo_ftplugin*

When the user does ":setfiletype xyz" the effect of the previous filetype
should be undone.  Set the b:undo_ftplugin variable to the commands that will
undo the settings in your filetype plugin.  Example: >

	let b:undo_ftplugin = "setlocal fo< com< tw< commentstring<"
		\ . "| unlet b:match_ignorecase b:match_words b:match_skip"

Using ":setlocal" with "<" after the option name resets the option to its
global value.  That is mostly the best way to reset the option value.

This does require removing the "C" flag from 'cpoptions' to allow line
continuation, as mentioned above |use-cpo-save|.


FILE NAME

The filetype must be included in the file name |ftplugin-name|.  Use one of
these three forms:

	.../ftplugin/stuff.vim
	.../ftplugin/stuff_foo.vim
	.../ftplugin/stuff/bar.vim

"stuff" is the filetype, "foo" and "bar" are arbitrary names.


SUMMARY							*ftplugin-special*

Summary of special things to use in a filetype plugin:

<LocalLeader>		Value of "maplocalleader", which the user defines as
			the keys that filetype plugin mappings start with.

:map <buffer>		Define a mapping local to the buffer.

:noremap <script>	Only remap mappings defined in this script that start
			with <SID>.

:setlocal		Set an option for the current buffer only.

:command -buffer	Define a user command local to the buffer.

exists("*s:Func")	Check if a function was already defined.

Also see |plugin-special|, the special things used for all plugins.

==============================================================================
*41.13*	Writing a compiler plugin		*write-compiler-plugin*

A compiler plugin sets options for use with a specific compiler.  The user can
load it with the |:compiler| command.  The main use is to set the
'errorformat' and 'makeprg' options.

Easiest is to have a look at examples.  This command will edit all the default
compiler plugins: >

	:next $VIMRUNTIME/compiler/*.vim

Use |:next| to go to the next plugin file.

There are two special items about these files.  First is a mechanism to allow
a user to overrule or add to the default file.  The default files start with: >

	:if exists("current_compiler")
	:  finish
	:endif
	:let current_compiler = "mine"

When you write a compiler file and put it in your personal runtime directory
(e.g., ~/.vim/compiler for Unix), you set the "current_compiler" variable to
make the default file skip the settings.
							*:CompilerSet*
The second mechanism is to use ":set" for ":compiler!" and ":setlocal" for
":compiler".  Vim defines the ":CompilerSet" user command for this.  However,
older Vim versions don't, thus your plugin should define it then.  This is an
example: >

  if exists(":CompilerSet") != 2
    command -nargs=* CompilerSet setlocal <args>
  endif
  CompilerSet errorformat&		" use the default 'errorformat'
  CompilerSet makeprg=nmake

When you write a compiler plugin for the Vim distribution or for a system-wide
runtime directory, use the mechanism mentioned above.  When
"current_compiler" was already set by a user plugin nothing will be done.

When you write a compiler plugin to overrule settings from a default plugin,
don't check "current_compiler".  This plugin is supposed to be loaded
last, thus it should be in a directory at the end of 'runtimepath'.  For Unix
that could be ~/.vim/after/compiler.

==============================================================================
*41.14*	Writing a plugin that loads quickly	*write-plugin-quickload*

A plugin may grow and become quite long.  The startup delay may become
noticeable, while you hardly ever use the plugin.  Then it's time for a
quickload plugin.

The basic idea is that the plugin is loaded twice.  The first time user
commands and mappings are defined that offer the functionality.  The second
time the functions that implement the functionality are defined.

It may sound surprising that quickload means loading a script twice.  What we
mean is that it loads quickly the first time, postponing the bulk of the
script to the second time, which only happens when you actually use it.  When
you always use the functionality it actually gets slower!

Note that since Vim 7 there is an alternative: use the |autoload|
functionality |41.15|.

The following example shows how it's done: >

	" Vim global plugin for demonstrating quick loading
	" Last Change:	2005 Feb 25
	" Maintainer:	Bram Moolenaar <Bram@vim.org>
	" License:	This file is placed in the public domain.

	if !exists("s:did_load")
		command -nargs=* BNRead  call BufNetRead(<f-args>)
		map <F19> :call BufNetWrite('something')<CR>

		let s:did_load = 1
		exe 'au FuncUndefined BufNet* source ' . expand('<sfile>')
		finish
	endif

	function BufNetRead(...)
		echo 'BufNetRead(' . string(a:000) . ')'
		" read functionality here
	endfunction

	function BufNetWrite(...)
		echo 'BufNetWrite(' . string(a:000) . ')'
		" write functionality here
	endfunction

When the script is first loaded "s:did_load" is not set.  The commands between
the "if" and "endif" will be executed.  This ends in a |:finish| command, thus
the rest of the script is not executed.

The second time the script is loaded "s:did_load" exists and the commands
after the "endif" are executed.  This defines the (possible long)
BufNetRead() and BufNetWrite() functions.

If you drop this script in your plugin directory Vim will execute it on
startup.  This is the sequence of events that happens:

1. The "BNRead" command is defined and the <F19> key is mapped when the script
   is sourced at startup.  A |FuncUndefined| autocommand is defined.  The
   ":finish" command causes the script to terminate early.

2. The user types the BNRead command or presses the <F19> key.  The
   BufNetRead() or BufNetWrite() function will be called.

3. Vim can't find the function and triggers the |FuncUndefined| autocommand
   event.  Since the pattern "BufNet*" matches the invoked function, the
   command "source fname" will be executed.  "fname" will be equal to the name
   of the script, no matter where it is located, because it comes from
   expanding "<sfile>" (see |expand()|).

4. The script is sourced again, the "s:did_load" variable exists and the
   functions are defined.

Notice that the functions that are loaded afterwards match the pattern in the
|FuncUndefined| autocommand.  You must make sure that no other plugin defines
functions that match this pattern.

==============================================================================
*41.15*	Writing library scripts			*write-library-script*

Some functionality will be required in several places.  When this becomes more
than a few lines you will want to put it in one script and use it from many
scripts.  We will call that one script a library script.

Manually loading a library script is possible, so long as you avoid loading it
when it's already done.  You can do this with the |exists()| function.
Example: >

	if !exists('*MyLibFunction')
	   runtime library/mylibscript.vim
	endif
	call MyLibFunction(arg)

Here you need to know that MyLibFunction() is defined in a script
"library/mylibscript.vim" in one of the directories in 'runtimepath'.

To make this a bit simpler Vim offers the autoload mechanism.  Then the
example looks like this: >

	call mylib#myfunction(arg)

That's a lot simpler, isn't it?  Vim will recognize the function name and when
it's not defined search for the script "autoload/mylib.vim" in 'runtimepath'.
That script must define the "mylib#myfunction()" function.

You can put many other functions in the mylib.vim script, you are free to
organize your functions in library scripts.  But you must use function names
where the part before the '#' matches the script name.  Otherwise Vim would
not know what script to load.

If you get really enthusiastic and write lots of library scripts, you may
want to use subdirectories.  Example: >

	call netlib#ftp#read('somefile')

For Unix the library script used for this could be:

	~/.vim/autoload/netlib/ftp.vim

Where the function is defined like this: >

	function netlib#ftp#read(fname)
		"  Read the file fname through ftp
	endfunction

Notice that the name the function is defined with is exactly the same as the
name used for calling the function.  And the part before the last '#'
exactly matches the subdirectory and script name.

You can use the same mechanism for variables: >

	let weekdays = dutch#weekdays

This will load the script "autoload/dutch.vim", which should contain something
like: >

	let dutch#weekdays = ['zondag', 'maandag', 'dinsdag', 'woensdag',
		\ 'donderdag', 'vrijdag', 'zaterdag']

Further reading: |autoload|.

==============================================================================
*41.16*	Distributing Vim scripts			*distribute-script*

Vim users will look for scripts on the Vim website: http://www.vim.org.
If you made something that is useful for others, share it!

Vim scripts can be used on any system.  There might not be a tar or gzip
command.  If you want to pack files together and/or compress them the "zip"
utility is recommended.

For utmost portability use Vim itself to pack scripts together.  This can be
done with the Vimball utility.  See |vimball|.

It's good if you add a line to allow automatic updating.  See |glvs-plugins|.

Syntax highlighting		*syntax* *syntax-highlighting* *coloring*

Syntax highlighting enables Vim to show parts of the text in another font or
color.	Those parts can be specific keywords or text matching a pattern.  Vim
doesn't parse the whole file (to keep it fast), so the highlighting has its
limitations.  Lexical highlighting might be a better name, but since everybody
calls it syntax highlighting we'll stick with that.

Vim supports syntax highlighting on all terminals.  But since most ordinary
terminals have very limited highlighting possibilities, it works best in the
GUI version, gvim.

In the User Manual:
|usr_06.txt| introduces syntax highlighting.
|usr_44.txt| introduces writing a syntax file.

{Vi does not have any of these commands}

Syntax highlighting is not available when the |+syntax| feature has been
disabled at compile time.

==============================================================================
1. Quick start						*:syn-qstart*

						*:syn-enable* *:syntax-enable*
This command switches on syntax highlighting: >

	:syntax enable

What this command actually does is to execute the command >
	:source $VIMRUNTIME/syntax/syntax.vim

If the VIM environment variable is not set, Vim will try to find
the path in another way (see |$VIMRUNTIME|).  Usually this works just
fine.  If it doesn't, try setting the VIM environment variable to the
directory where the Vim stuff is located.  For example, if your syntax files
are in the "/usr/vim/vim50/syntax" directory, set $VIMRUNTIME to
"/usr/vim/vim50".  You must do this in the shell, before starting Vim.

							*:syn-on* *:syntax-on*
The ":syntax enable" command will keep your current color settings.  This
allows using ":highlight" commands to set your preferred colors before or
after using this command.  If you want Vim to overrule your settings with the
defaults, use: >
	:syntax on
<
					*:hi-normal* *:highlight-normal*
If you are running in the GUI, you can get white text on a black background
with: >
	:highlight Normal guibg=Black guifg=White
For a color terminal see |:hi-normal-cterm|.
For setting up your own colors syntax highlighting see |syncolor|.

NOTE: The syntax files on MS-DOS and Windows have lines that end in <CR><NL>.
The files for Unix end in <NL>.  This means you should use the right type of
file for your system.  Although on MS-DOS and Windows the right format is
automatically selected if the 'fileformats' option is not empty.

NOTE: When using reverse video ("gvim -fg white -bg black"), the default value
of 'background' will not be set until the GUI window is opened, which is after
reading the |gvimrc|.  This will cause the wrong default highlighting to be
used.  To set the default value of 'background' before switching on
highlighting, include the ":gui" command in the |gvimrc|: >

   :gui		" open window and set default for 'background'
   :syntax on	" start highlighting, use 'background' to set colors

NOTE: Using ":gui" in the |gvimrc| means that "gvim -f" won't start in the
foreground!  Use ":gui -f" then.

							*g:syntax_on*
You can toggle the syntax on/off with this command: >
   :if exists("g:syntax_on") | syntax off | else | syntax enable | endif

To put this into a mapping, you can use: >
   :map <F7> :if exists("g:syntax_on") <Bar>
	\   syntax off <Bar>
	\ else <Bar>
	\   syntax enable <Bar>
	\ endif <CR>
[using the |<>| notation, type this literally]

Details:
The ":syntax" commands are implemented by sourcing a file.  To see exactly how
this works, look in the file:
    command		file ~
    :syntax enable	$VIMRUNTIME/syntax/syntax.vim
    :syntax on		$VIMRUNTIME/syntax/syntax.vim
    :syntax manual	$VIMRUNTIME/syntax/manual.vim
    :syntax off		$VIMRUNTIME/syntax/nosyntax.vim
Also see |syntax-loading|.

NOTE: If displaying long lines is slow and switching off syntax highlighting
makes it fast, consider setting the 'synmaxcol' option to a lower value.

==============================================================================
2. Syntax files						*:syn-files*

The syntax and highlighting commands for one language are normally stored in
a syntax file.	The name convention is: "{name}.vim".  Where {name} is the
name of the language, or an abbreviation (to fit the name in 8.3 characters,
a requirement in case the file is used on a DOS filesystem).
Examples:
	c.vim		perl.vim	java.vim	html.vim
	cpp.vim		sh.vim		csh.vim

The syntax file can contain any Ex commands, just like a vimrc file.  But
the idea is that only commands for a specific language are included.  When a
language is a superset of another language, it may include the other one,
for example, the cpp.vim file could include the c.vim file: >
   :so $VIMRUNTIME/syntax/c.vim

The .vim files are normally loaded with an autocommand.  For example: >
   :au Syntax c	    runtime! syntax/c.vim
   :au Syntax cpp   runtime! syntax/cpp.vim
These commands are normally in the file $VIMRUNTIME/syntax/synload.vim.


MAKING YOUR OWN SYNTAX FILES				*mysyntaxfile*

When you create your own syntax files, and you want to have Vim use these
automatically with ":syntax enable", do this:

1. Create your user runtime directory.	You would normally use the first item
   of the 'runtimepath' option.  Example for Unix: >
	mkdir ~/.vim

2. Create a directory in there called "syntax".  For Unix: >
	mkdir ~/.vim/syntax

3. Write the Vim syntax file.  Or download one from the internet.  Then write
   it in your syntax directory.  For example, for the "mine" syntax: >
	:w ~/.vim/syntax/mine.vim

Now you can start using your syntax file manually: >
	:set syntax=mine
You don't have to exit Vim to use this.

If you also want Vim to detect the type of file, see |new-filetype|.

If you are setting up a system with many users and you don't want each user
to add the same syntax file, you can use another directory from 'runtimepath'.


ADDING TO AN EXISTING SYNTAX FILE		*mysyntaxfile-add*

If you are mostly satisfied with an existing syntax file, but would like to
add a few items or change the highlighting, follow these steps:

1. Create your user directory from 'runtimepath', see above.

2. Create a directory in there called "after/syntax".  For Unix: >
	mkdir ~/.vim/after
	mkdir ~/.vim/after/syntax

3. Write a Vim script that contains the commands you want to use.  For
   example, to change the colors for the C syntax: >
	highlight cComment ctermfg=Green guifg=Green

4. Write that file in the "after/syntax" directory.  Use the name of the
   syntax, with ".vim" added.  For our C syntax: >
	:w ~/.vim/after/syntax/c.vim

That's it.  The next time you edit a C file the Comment color will be
different.  You don't even have to restart Vim.

If you have multiple files, you can use the filetype as the directory name.
All the "*.vim" files in this directory will be used, for example:
	~/.vim/after/syntax/c/one.vim
	~/.vim/after/syntax/c/two.vim


REPLACING AN EXISTING SYNTAX FILE			*mysyntaxfile-replace*

If you don't like a distributed syntax file, or you have downloaded a new
version, follow the same steps as for |mysyntaxfile| above.  Just make sure
that you write the syntax file in a directory that is early in 'runtimepath'.
Vim will only load the first syntax file found, assuming that it sets
b:current_syntax.


NAMING CONVENTIONS		    *group-name* *{group-name}* *E669* *W18*

A syntax group name is to be used for syntax items that match the same kind of
thing.  These are then linked to a highlight group that specifies the color.
A syntax group name doesn't specify any color or attributes itself.

The name for a highlight or syntax group must consist of ASCII letters, digits
and the underscore.  As a regexp: "[a-zA-Z0-9_]*"

To be able to allow each user to pick his favorite set of colors, there must
be preferred names for highlight groups that are common for many languages.
These are the suggested group names (if syntax highlighting works properly
you can see the actual color, except for "Ignore"):

	*Comment	any comment

	*Constant	any constant
	 String		a string constant: "this is a string"
	 Character	a character constant: 'c', '\n'
	 Number		a number constant: 234, 0xff
	 Boolean	a boolean constant: TRUE, false
	 Float		a floating point constant: 2.3e10

	*Identifier	any variable name
	 Function	function name (also: methods for classes)

	*Statement	any statement
	 Conditional	if, then, else, endif, switch, etc.
	 Repeat		for, do, while, etc.
	 Label		case, default, etc.
	 Operator	"sizeof", "+", "*", etc.
	 Keyword	any other keyword
	 Exception	try, catch, throw

	*PreProc	generic Preprocessor
	 Include	preprocessor #include
	 Define		preprocessor #define
	 Macro		same as Define
	 PreCondit	preprocessor #if, #else, #endif, etc.

	*Type		int, long, char, etc.
	 StorageClass	static, register, volatile, etc.
	 Structure	struct, union, enum, etc.
	 Typedef	A typedef

	*Special	any special symbol
	 SpecialChar	special character in a constant
	 Tag		you can use CTRL-] on this
	 Delimiter	character that needs attention
	 SpecialComment	special things inside a comment
	 Debug		debugging statements

	*Underlined	text that stands out, HTML links

	*Ignore		left blank, hidden  |hl-Ignore|

	*Error		any erroneous construct

	*Todo		anything that needs extra attention; mostly the
			keywords TODO FIXME and XXX

The names marked with * are the preferred groups; the others are minor groups.
For the preferred groups, the "syntax.vim" file contains default highlighting.
The minor groups are linked to the preferred groups, so they get the same
highlighting.  You can override these defaults by using ":highlight" commands
after sourcing the "syntax.vim" file.

Note that highlight group names are not case sensitive.  "String" and "string"
can be used for the same group.

The following names are reserved and cannot be used as a group name:
	NONE   ALL   ALLBUT   contains	 contained

							*hl-Ignore*
When using the Ignore group, you may also consider using the conceal
mechanism.  See |conceal|.

==============================================================================
3. Syntax loading procedure				*syntax-loading*

This explains the details that happen when the command ":syntax enable" is
issued.  When Vim initializes itself, it finds out where the runtime files are
located.  This is used here as the variable |$VIMRUNTIME|.

":syntax enable" and ":syntax on" do the following:

    Source $VIMRUNTIME/syntax/syntax.vim
    |
    +-	Clear out any old syntax by sourcing $VIMRUNTIME/syntax/nosyntax.vim
    |
    +-	Source first syntax/synload.vim in 'runtimepath'
    |	|
    |	+-  Setup the colors for syntax highlighting.  If a color scheme is
    |	|   defined it is loaded again with ":colors {name}".  Otherwise
    |	|   ":runtime! syntax/syncolor.vim" is used.  ":syntax on" overrules
    |	|   existing colors, ":syntax enable" only sets groups that weren't
    |	|   set yet.
    |	|
    |	+-  Set up syntax autocmds to load the appropriate syntax file when
    |	|   the 'syntax' option is set. *synload-1*
    |	|
    |	+-  Source the user's optional file, from the |mysyntaxfile| variable.
    |	    This is for backwards compatibility with Vim 5.x only. *synload-2*
    |
    +-	Do ":filetype on", which does ":runtime! filetype.vim".  It loads any
    |	filetype.vim files found.  It should always Source
    |	$VIMRUNTIME/filetype.vim, which does the following.
    |	|
    |	+-  Install autocmds based on suffix to set the 'filetype' option
    |	|   This is where the connection between file name and file type is
    |	|   made for known file types. *synload-3*
    |	|
    |	+-  Source the user's optional file, from the *myfiletypefile*
    |	|   variable.  This is for backwards compatibility with Vim 5.x only.
    |	|   *synload-4*
    |	|
    |	+-  Install one autocommand which sources scripts.vim when no file
    |	|   type was detected yet. *synload-5*
    |	|
    |	+-  Source $VIMRUNTIME/menu.vim, to setup the Syntax menu. |menu.vim|
    |
    +-	Install a FileType autocommand to set the 'syntax' option when a file
    |	type has been detected. *synload-6*
    |
    +-	Execute syntax autocommands to start syntax highlighting for each
	already loaded buffer.


Upon loading a file, Vim finds the relevant syntax file as follows:

    Loading the file triggers the BufReadPost autocommands.
    |
    +-	If there is a match with one of the autocommands from |synload-3|
    |	(known file types) or |synload-4| (user's file types), the 'filetype'
    |	option is set to the file type.
    |
    +-	The autocommand at |synload-5| is triggered.  If the file type was not
    |	found yet, then scripts.vim is searched for in 'runtimepath'.  This
    |	should always load $VIMRUNTIME/scripts.vim, which does the following.
    |	|
    |	+-  Source the user's optional file, from the *myscriptsfile*
    |	|   variable.  This is for backwards compatibility with Vim 5.x only.
    |	|
    |	+-  If the file type is still unknown, check the contents of the file,
    |	    again with checks like "getline(1) =~ pattern" as to whether the
    |	    file type can be recognized, and set 'filetype'.
    |
    +-	When the file type was determined and 'filetype' was set, this
    |	triggers the FileType autocommand |synload-6| above.  It sets
    |	'syntax' to the determined file type.
    |
    +-	When the 'syntax' option was set above, this triggers an autocommand
    |	from |synload-1| (and |synload-2|).  This find the main syntax file in
    |	'runtimepath', with this command:
    |		runtime! syntax/<name>.vim
    |
    +-	Any other user installed FileType or Syntax autocommands are
	triggered.  This can be used to change the highlighting for a specific
	syntax.

==============================================================================
4. Syntax file remarks					*:syn-file-remarks*

						*b:current_syntax-variable*
Vim stores the name of the syntax that has been loaded in the
"b:current_syntax" variable.  You can use this if you want to load other
settings, depending on which syntax is active.	Example: >
   :au BufReadPost * if b:current_syntax == "csh"
   :au BufReadPost *   do-some-things
   :au BufReadPost * endif


2HTML						*2html.vim* *convert-to-HTML*

This is not a syntax file itself, but a script that converts the current
window into HTML. Vim opens a new window in which it builds the HTML file.

After you save the resulting file, you can view it with any browser. The
colors should be exactly the same as you see them in Vim.  With
|g:html_line_ids| you can jump to specific lines by adding (for example) #L123
or #123 to the end of the URL in your browser's address bar. And with
|g:html_dynamic_folds| enabled, you can show or hide the text that is folded
in Vim.

You are not supposed to set the 'filetype' or 'syntax' option to "2html"!
Source the script to convert the current file: >

	:runtime! syntax/2html.vim
<
Many variables affect the output of 2html.vim; see below. Any of the on/off
options listed below can be enabled or disabled by setting them explicitly to
the desired value, or restored to their default by removing the variable using
|:unlet|.

Remarks:
- Some truly ancient browsers may not show the background colors.
- From most browsers you can also print the file (in color)!
- The latest TOhtml may actually work with older versions of Vim, but some
  features such as conceal support will not function, and the colors may be
  incorrect for an old Vim without GUI support compiled in.

Here is an example how to run the script over all .c and .h files from a
Unix shell: >
   for f in *.[ch]; do gvim -f +"syn on" +"run! syntax/2html.vim" +"wq" +"q" $f; done
<
					*g:html_start_line* *g:html_end_line*
To restrict the conversion to a range of lines, use a range with the |:TOhtml|
command below, or set "g:html_start_line" and "g:html_end_line" to the first
and last line to be converted.  Example, using the last set Visual area: >

	:let g:html_start_line = line("'<")
	:let g:html_end_line = line("'>")
	:runtime! syntax/2html.vim
<
							*:TOhtml*
:[range]TOhtml		The ":TOhtml" command is defined in a standard plugin.
			This command will source |2html.vim| for you. When a
			range is given, set |g:html_start_line| and
			|g:html_end_line| to the start and end of the range,
			respectively. Default range is the entire buffer.

                        If the current window is part of a |diff|, unless
                        |g:html_diff_one_file| is set, :TOhtml will convert
                        all windows which are part of the diff in the current
                        tab and place them side-by-side in a <table> element
                        in the generated HTML. With |g:html_line_ids| you can
                        jump to lines in specific windows with (for example)
                        #W1L42 for line 42 in the first diffed window, or
                        #W3L87 for line 87 in the third.

			Examples: >

	:10,40TOhtml " convert lines 10-40 to html
	:'<,'>TOhtml " convert current/last visual selection
	:TOhtml      " convert entire buffer
<
							*g:html_diff_one_file*
Default: 0.
When 0, and using |:TOhtml| all windows involved in a |diff| in the current tab
page are converted to HTML and placed side-by-side in a <table> element. When
1, only the current buffer is converted.
Example: >

	let g:html_diff_one_file = 1
<
							 *g:html_whole_filler*
Default: 0.
When 0, if |g:html_diff_one_file| is 1, a sequence of more than 3 filler lines
is displayed as three lines with the middle line mentioning the total number
of inserted lines.
When 1, always display all inserted lines as if |g:html_diff_one_file| were
not set.
>
    :let g:html_whole_filler = 1
<
				     *TOhtml-performance* *g:html_no_progress*
Default: 0.
When 0, display a progress bar in the statusline for each major step in the
2html.vim conversion process.
When 1, do not display the progress bar. This offers a minor speed improvement
but you won't have any idea how much longer the conversion might take; for big
files it can take a long time!
Example: >

	let g:html_no_progress = 1
<
You can obtain better performance improvements by also instructing Vim to not
run interactively, so that too much time is not taken to redraw as the script
moves through the buffer, switches windows, and the like: >

  vim -E -s -c "let g:html_no_progress=1" -c "syntax on" -c "set ft=c" -c "runtime syntax/2html.vim" -cwqa myfile.c
<
Note that the -s flag prevents loading your .vimrc and any plugins, so you
need to explicitly source/enable anything that will affect the HTML
conversion. See |-E| and |-s-ex| for details. It is probably best to create a
script to replace all the -c commands and use it with the -u flag instead of
specifying each command separately.

							 *g:html_number_lines*
Default: current 'number' setting.
When 0, buffer text is displayed in the generated HTML without line numbering.
When 1, a column of line numbers is added to the generated HTML with the same
highlighting as the line number column in Vim (|hl-LineNr|).
Force line numbers even if 'number' is not set: >
   :let g:html_number_lines = 1
Force to omit the line numbers: >
   :let g:html_number_lines = 0
Go back to the default to use 'number' by deleting the variable: >
   :unlet g:html_number_lines
<
                                                             *g:html_line_ids*
Default: 1 if |g:html_number_lines| is set, 0 otherwise.
When 1, adds an HTML id attribute to each line number, or to an empty <span>
inserted for that purpose if no line numbers are shown. This ID attribute
takes the form of L123 for single-buffer HTML pages, or W2L123 for diff-view
pages, and is used to jump to a specific line (in a specific window of a diff
view). Javascript is inserted to open any closed dynamic folds
(|g:html_dynamic_folds|) containing the specified line before jumping. The
javascript also allows omitting the window ID in the url, and the leading L.
For example: >

	page.html#L123	jumps to line 123 in a single-buffer file
	page.html#123	does the same

	diff.html#W1L42	jumps to line 42 in the first window in a diff
	diff.html#42	does the same
<
							      *g:html_use_css*
Default: 1.
When 1, generate valid HTML 4.01 markup with CSS1 styling, supported in all
modern browsers and most old browsers.
When 0, generate <font> tags and similar outdated markup. This is not
recommended but it may work better in really old browsers, email clients,
forum posts, and similar situations where basic CSS support is unavailable.
Example: >
   :let g:html_use_css = 0
<
						       *g:html_ignore_conceal*
Default: 0.
When 0, concealed text is removed from the HTML and replaced with a character
from |:syn-cchar| or 'listchars' as appropriate, depending on the current
value of 'conceallevel'.
When 1, include all text from the buffer in the generated HTML, even if it is
|conceal|ed.

Either of the following commands will ensure that all text in the buffer is
included in the generated HTML (unless it is folded): >
   :let g:html_ignore_conceal = 1
   :setl conceallevel=0
<
						       *g:html_ignore_folding*
Default: 0.
When 0, text in a closed fold is replaced by the text shown for the fold in
Vim (|fold-foldtext|). See |g:html_dynamic_folds| if you also want to allow
the user to expand the fold as in Vim to see the text inside.
When 1, include all text from the buffer in the generated HTML; whether the
text is in a fold has no impact at all. |g:html_dynamic_folds| has no effect.

Either of these commands will ensure that all text in the buffer is included
in the generated HTML (unless it is concealed): >
   zR
   :let g:html_ignore_folding = 1
<
							*g:html_dynamic_folds*
Default: 0.
When 0, text in a closed fold is not included at all in the generated HTML.
When 1, generate javascript to open a fold and show the text within, just like
in Vim.

Setting this variable to 1 causes 2html.vim to always use CSS for styling,
regardless of what |g:html_use_css| is set to.

This variable is ignored when |g:html_ignore_folding| is set.
>
   :let g:html_dynamic_folds = 1
<
							*g:html_no_foldcolumn*
Default: 0.
When 0, if |g:html_dynamic_folds| is 1, generate a column of text similar to
Vim's foldcolumn (|fold-foldcolumn|) the user can click on to toggle folds
open or closed. The minimum width of the generated text column is the current
'foldcolumn' setting.
When 1, do not generate this column; instead, hovering the mouse cursor over
folded text will open the fold as if |g:html_hover_unfold| were set.
>
   :let g:html_no_foldcolumn = 1
<
				*TOhtml-uncopyable-text* *g:html_prevent_copy*
Default: empty string.
This option prevents certain regions of the generated HTML from being copied,
when you select all text in document rendered in a browser and copy it. Useful
for allowing users to copy-paste only the source text even if a fold column or
line numbers are shown in the generated content. Specify regions to be
affected in this way as follows:
	f:	fold column
	n:	line numbers (also within fold text)
	t:	fold text
	d:	diff filler

Example, to make the fold column and line numbers uncopyable: >
	:let g:html_prevent_copy = "fn"
<
This feature is currently implemented by inserting read-only <input> elements
into the markup to contain the uncopyable areas. This does not work well in
all cases. When pasting to some applications which understand HTML, the
<input> elements also get pasted. But plain-text paste destinations should
always work.

							   *g:html_no_invalid*
Default: 0.
When 0, if |g:html_prevent_copy| is non-empty, an invalid attribute is
intentionally inserted into the <input> element for the uncopyable areas. This
increases the number of applications you can paste to without also pasting the
<input> elements. Specifically, Microsoft Word will not paste the <input>
elements if they contain this invalid attribute.
When 1, no invalid markup is ever intentionally inserted, and the generated
page should validate. However, be careful pasting into Microsoft Word when
|g:html_prevent_copy| is non-empty; it can be hard to get rid of the <input>
elements which get pasted.

							 *g:html_hover_unfold*
Default: 0.
When 0, the only way to open a fold generated by 2html.vim with
|g:html_dynamic_folds| set, is to click on the generated fold column.
When 1, use CSS 2.0 to allow the user to open a fold by moving the mouse
cursor over the displayed fold text. This is useful to allow users with
disabled javascript to view the folded text.

Note that old browsers (notably Internet Explorer 6) will not support this
feature.  Browser-specific markup for IE6 is included to fall back to the
normal CSS1 styling so that the folds show up correctly for this browser, but
they will not be openable without a foldcolumn.
>
   :let g:html_hover_unfold = 1
<
							      *g:html_id_expr*
Default: ""
Dynamic folding and jumping to line IDs rely on unique IDs within the document
to work. If generated HTML is copied into a larger document, these IDs are no
longer guaranteed to be unique. Set g:html_id_expr to an expression Vim can
evaluate to get a unique string to append to each ID used in a given document,
so that the full IDs will be unique even when combined with other content in a
larger HTML document. Example, to append _ and the buffer number to each ID: >

	:let g:html_id_expr = '"_".bufnr("%")'
<
To append a string "_mystring" to the end of each ID: >

	:let g:html_id_expr = '"_mystring"'
<
Note, when converting a diff view to HTML, the expression will only be
evaluated for the first window in the diff, and the result used for all the
windows.

					  *TOhtml-wrap-text* *g:html_pre_wrap*
Default: current 'wrap' setting.
When 0, if |g:html_no_pre| is 0 or unset, the text in the generated HTML does
not wrap at the edge of the browser window.
When 1, if |g:html_use_css| is 1, the CSS 2.0 "white-space:pre-wrap" value is
used, causing the text to wrap at whitespace at the edge of the browser
window.
Explicitly enable text wrapping: >
   :let g:html_pre_wrap = 1
Explicitly disable wrapping: >
   :let g:html_pre_wrap = 0
Go back to default, determine wrapping from 'wrap' setting: >
   :unlet g:html_pre_wrap
<
							       *g:html_no_pre*
Default: 0.
When 0, buffer text in the generated HTML is surrounded by <pre>...</pre>
tags. Series of whitespace is shown as in Vim without special markup, and tab
characters can be included literally (see |g:html_expand_tabs|).
When 1 (not recommended), the <pre> tags are omitted, and a plain <div> is
used instead. Whitespace is replaced by a series of &nbsp; character
references, and <br> is used to end each line. This is another way to allow
text in the generated HTML is wrap (see |g:html_pre_wrap|) which also works in
old browsers, but may cause noticeable differences between Vim's display and
the rendered page generated by 2html.vim.
>
   :let g:html_no_pre = 1
<
							  *g:html_expand_tabs*
Default: 1 if 'tabstop' is 8, 'expandtab' is 0, and no fold column or line
		numbers occur in the generated HTML;
	 0 otherwise.
When 0, <Tab> characters in the buffer text are replaced with an appropriate
number of space characters, or &nbsp; references if |g:html_no_pre| is 1.
When 1, if |g:html_no_pre| is 0 or unset, <Tab> characters in the buffer text
are included as-is in the generated HTML. This is useful for when you want to
allow copy and paste from a browser without losing the actual whitespace in
the source document. Note that this can easily break text alignment and
indentation in the HTML, unless set by default.

Force |2html.vim| to keep <Tab> characters: >
   :let g:html_expand_tabs = 0
<
Force tabs to be expanded: >
   :let g:html_expand_tabs = 1
<
				    *TOhtml-encoding-detect* *TOhtml-encoding*
It is highly recommended to set your desired encoding with
|g:html_use_encoding| for any content which will be placed on a web server.

If you do not specify an encoding, |2html.vim| uses the preferred IANA name
for the current value of 'fileencoding' if set, or 'encoding' if not.
'encoding' is always used for certain 'buftype' values. 'fileencoding' will be
set to match the chosen document encoding.

Automatic detection works for the encodings mentioned specifically by name in
|encoding-names|, but TOhtml will only automatically use those encodings with
wide browser support. However, you can override this to support specific
encodings that may not be automatically detected by default (see options
below). See http://www.iana.org/assignments/character-sets for the IANA names.

Note, by default all Unicode encodings are converted to UTF-8 with no BOM in
the generated HTML, as recommended by W3C:

	http://www.w3.org/International/questions/qa-choosing-encodings
	http://www.w3.org/International/questions/qa-byte-order-mark

							 *g:html_use_encoding*
Default: none, uses IANA name for current 'fileencoding' as above.
To overrule all automatic charset detection, set g:html_use_encoding to the
name of the charset to be used. It is recommended to set this variable to
something widely supported, like UTF-8, for anything you will be hosting on a
webserver: >
   :let g:html_use_encoding = "UTF-8"
You can also use this option to omit the line that specifies the charset
entirely, by setting g:html_use_encoding to an empty string (NOT recommended): >
   :let g:html_use_encoding = ""
To go back to the automatic mechanism, delete the |g:html_use_encoding|
variable: >
   :unlet g:html_use_encoding
<
						    *g:html_encoding_override*
Default: none, autoload/tohtml.vim contains default conversions for encodings
		mentioned by name at |encoding-names|.
This option allows |2html.vim| to detect the correct 'fileencoding' when you
specify an encoding with |g:html_use_encoding| which is not in the default
list of conversions.

This is a dictionary of charset-encoding pairs that will replace existing
pairs automatically detected by TOhtml, or supplement with new pairs.

Detect the HTML charset "windows-1252" as the encoding "8bit-cp1252": >
   :let g:html_encoding_override = {'windows-1252': '8bit-cp1252'}
<
						     *g:html_charset_override*
Default: none, autoload/tohtml.vim contains default conversions for encodings
		mentioned by name at |encoding-names| and which have wide
		browser support.
This option allows |2html.vim| to detect the HTML charset for any
'fileencoding' or 'encoding' which is not detected automatically. You can also
use it to override specific existing encoding-charset pairs. For example,
TOhtml will by default use UTF-8 for all Unicode/UCS encodings. To use UTF-16
and UTF-32 instead, use: >
   :let g:html_charset_override = {'ucs-4': 'UTF-32', 'utf-16': 'UTF-16'}

Note that documents encoded in either UTF-32 or UTF-16 have known
compatibility problems with some major browsers.

			*convert-to-XML* *convert-to-XHTML* *g:html_use_xhtml*
Default: 0.
When 0, generate standard HTML 4.01 (strict when possible).
When 1, generate XHTML 1.0 instead (XML compliant HTML).
>
    :let g:html_use_xhtml = 1
<

ABEL						*abel.vim* *ft-abel-syntax*

ABEL highlighting provides some user-defined options.  To enable them, assign
any value to the respective variable.  Example: >
	:let abel_obsolete_ok=1
To disable them use ":unlet".  Example: >
	:unlet abel_obsolete_ok

Variable			Highlight ~
abel_obsolete_ok		obsolete keywords are statements, not errors
abel_cpp_comments_illegal	do not interpret '//' as inline comment leader


ADA

See |ft-ada-syntax|


ANT						*ant.vim* *ft-ant-syntax*

The ant syntax file provides syntax highlighting for javascript and python
by default.  Syntax highlighting for other script languages can be installed
by the function AntSyntaxScript(), which takes the tag name as first argument
and the script syntax file name as second argument.  Example: >

	:call AntSyntaxScript('perl', 'perl.vim')

will install syntax perl highlighting for the following ant code >

	<script language = 'perl'><![CDATA[
	    # everything inside is highlighted as perl
	]]></script>

See |mysyntaxfile-add| for installing script languages permanently.


APACHE						*apache.vim* *ft-apache-syntax*

The apache syntax file provides syntax highlighting depending on Apache HTTP
server version, by default for 1.3.x.  Set "apache_version" to Apache version
(as a string) to get highlighting for another version.	Example: >

	:let apache_version = "2.0"
<

		*asm.vim* *asmh8300.vim* *nasm.vim* *masm.vim* *asm68k*
ASSEMBLY	*ft-asm-syntax* *ft-asmh8300-syntax* *ft-nasm-syntax*
		*ft-masm-syntax* *ft-asm68k-syntax* *fasm.vim*

Files matching "*.i" could be Progress or Assembly.  If the automatic detection
doesn't work for you, or you don't edit Progress at all, use this in your
startup vimrc: >
   :let filetype_i = "asm"
Replace "asm" with the type of assembly you use.

There are many types of assembly languages that all use the same file name
extensions.  Therefore you will have to select the type yourself, or add a
line in the assembly file that Vim will recognize.  Currently these syntax
files are included:
	asm		GNU assembly (the default)
	asm68k		Motorola 680x0 assembly
	asmh8300	Hitachi H-8300 version of GNU assembly
	ia64		Intel Itanium 64
	fasm		Flat assembly (http://flatassembler.net)
	masm		Microsoft assembly (probably works for any 80x86)
	nasm		Netwide assembly
	tasm		Turbo Assembly (with opcodes 80x86 up to Pentium, and
			MMX)
	pic		PIC assembly (currently for PIC16F84)

The most flexible is to add a line in your assembly file containing: >
	asmsyntax=nasm
Replace "nasm" with the name of the real assembly syntax.  This line must be
one of the first five lines in the file.  No non-white text must be
immediately before or after this text.  Note that specifying asmsyntax=foo is
equivalent to setting ft=foo in a |modeline|, and that in case of a conflict
between the two settings the one from the modeline will take precedence (in
particular, if you have ft=asm in the modeline, you will get the GNU syntax
highlighting regardless of what is specified as asmsyntax).

The syntax type can always be overruled for a specific buffer by setting the
b:asmsyntax variable: >
	:let b:asmsyntax = "nasm"

If b:asmsyntax is not set, either automatically or by hand, then the value of
the global variable asmsyntax is used.	This can be seen as a default assembly
language: >
	:let asmsyntax = "nasm"

As a last resort, if nothing is defined, the "asm" syntax is used.


Netwide assembler (nasm.vim) optional highlighting ~

To enable a feature: >
	:let   {variable}=1|set syntax=nasm
To disable a feature: >
	:unlet {variable}  |set syntax=nasm

Variable		Highlight ~
nasm_loose_syntax	unofficial parser allowed syntax not as Error
			  (parser dependent; not recommended)
nasm_ctx_outside_macro	contexts outside macro not as Error
nasm_no_warn		potentially risky syntax not as ToDo


ASPPERL and ASPVBS			*ft-aspperl-syntax* *ft-aspvbs-syntax*

*.asp and *.asa files could be either Perl or Visual Basic script.  Since it's
hard to detect this you can set two global variables to tell Vim what you are
using.	For Perl script use: >
	:let g:filetype_asa = "aspperl"
	:let g:filetype_asp = "aspperl"
For Visual Basic use: >
	:let g:filetype_asa = "aspvbs"
	:let g:filetype_asp = "aspvbs"


BAAN						    *baan.vim* *baan-syntax*

The baan.vim gives syntax support for BaanC of release BaanIV upto SSA ERP LN
for both 3 GL and 4 GL programming. Large number of standard defines/constants
are supported.

Some special violation of coding standards will be signalled when one specify
in ones |.vimrc|: >
	let baan_code_stds=1

*baan-folding*

Syntax folding can be enabled at various levels through the variables
mentioned below (Set those in your |.vimrc|). The more complex folding on
source blocks and SQL can be CPU intensive.

To allow any folding and enable folding at function level use: >
	let baan_fold=1
Folding can be enabled at source block level as if, while, for ,... The
indentation preceding the begin/end keywords has to match (spaces are not
considered equal to a tab). >
	let baan_fold_block=1
Folding can be enabled for embedded SQL blocks as SELECT, SELECTDO,
SELECTEMPTY, ... The indentation preceding the begin/end keywords has to
match (spaces are not considered equal to a tab). >
	let baan_fold_sql=1
Note: Block folding can result in many small folds. It is suggested to |:set|
the options 'foldminlines' and 'foldnestmax' in |.vimrc| or use |:setlocal| in
.../after/syntax/baan.vim (see |after-directory|). Eg: >
	set foldminlines=5
	set foldnestmax=6


BASIC			*basic.vim* *vb.vim* *ft-basic-syntax* *ft-vb-syntax*

Both Visual Basic and "normal" basic use the extension ".bas".	To detect
which one should be used, Vim checks for the string "VB_Name" in the first
five lines of the file.  If it is not found, filetype will be "basic",
otherwise "vb".  Files with the ".frm" extension will always be seen as Visual
Basic.


C							*c.vim* *ft-c-syntax*

A few things in C highlighting are optional.  To enable them assign any value
to the respective variable.  Example: >
	:let c_comment_strings = 1
To disable them use ":unlet".  Example: >
	:unlet c_comment_strings

Variable		Highlight ~
c_gnu			GNU gcc specific items
c_comment_strings	strings and numbers inside a comment
c_space_errors		trailing white space and spaces before a <Tab>
c_no_trail_space_error	 ... but no trailing spaces
c_no_tab_space_error	 ... but no spaces before a <Tab>
c_no_bracket_error	don't highlight {}; inside [] as errors
c_no_curly_error	don't highlight {}; inside [] and () as errors;
				except { and } in first column
c_curly_error		highlight a missing }; this forces syncing from the
			start of the file, can be slow
c_no_ansi		don't do standard ANSI types and constants
c_ansi_typedefs		 ... but do standard ANSI types
c_ansi_constants	 ... but do standard ANSI constants
c_no_utf		don't highlight \u and \U in strings
c_syntax_for_h		for *.h files use C syntax instead of C++ and use objc
			syntax instead of objcpp
c_no_if0		don't highlight "#if 0" blocks as comments
c_no_cformat		don't highlight %-formats in strings
c_no_c99		don't highlight C99 standard items
c_no_c11		don't highlight C11 standard items

When 'foldmethod' is set to "syntax" then /* */ comments and { } blocks will
become a fold.  If you don't want comments to become a fold use: >
	:let c_no_comment_fold = 1
"#if 0" blocks are also folded, unless: >
	:let c_no_if0_fold = 1

If you notice highlighting errors while scrolling backwards, which are fixed
when redrawing with CTRL-L, try setting the "c_minlines" internal variable
to a larger number: >
	:let c_minlines = 100
This will make the syntax synchronization start 100 lines before the first
displayed line.  The default value is 50 (15 when c_no_if0 is set).  The
disadvantage of using a larger number is that redrawing can become slow.

When using the "#if 0" / "#endif" comment highlighting, notice that this only
works when the "#if 0" is within "c_minlines" from the top of the window.  If
you have a long "#if 0" construct it will not be highlighted correctly.

To match extra items in comments, use the cCommentGroup cluster.
Example: >
   :au Syntax c call MyCadd()
   :function MyCadd()
   :  syn keyword cMyItem contained Ni
   :  syn cluster cCommentGroup add=cMyItem
   :  hi link cMyItem Title
   :endfun

ANSI constants will be highlighted with the "cConstant" group.	This includes
"NULL", "SIG_IGN" and others.  But not "TRUE", for example, because this is
not in the ANSI standard.  If you find this confusing, remove the cConstant
highlighting: >
	:hi link cConstant NONE

If you see '{' and '}' highlighted as an error where they are OK, reset the
highlighting for cErrInParen and cErrInBracket.

If you want to use folding in your C files, you can add these lines in a file
in the "after" directory in 'runtimepath'.  For Unix this would be
~/.vim/after/syntax/c.vim. >
    syn sync fromstart
    set foldmethod=syntax

CH						*ch.vim* *ft-ch-syntax*

C/C++ interpreter.  Ch has similar syntax highlighting to C and builds upon
the C syntax file.  See |c.vim| for all the settings that are available for C.

By setting a variable you can tell Vim to use Ch syntax for *.h files, instead
of C or C++: >
	:let ch_syntax_for_h = 1


CHILL						*chill.vim* *ft-chill-syntax*

Chill syntax highlighting is similar to C.  See |c.vim| for all the settings
that are available.  Additionally there is:

chill_space_errors	like c_space_errors
chill_comment_string	like c_comment_strings
chill_minlines		like c_minlines


CHANGELOG				*changelog.vim* *ft-changelog-syntax*

ChangeLog supports highlighting spaces at the start of a line.
If you do not like this, add following line to your .vimrc: >
	let g:changelog_spacing_errors = 0
This works the next time you edit a changelog file.  You can also use
"b:changelog_spacing_errors" to set this per buffer (before loading the syntax
file).

You can change the highlighting used, e.g., to flag the spaces as an error: >
	:hi link ChangelogError Error
Or to avoid the highlighting: >
	:hi link ChangelogError NONE
This works immediately.


CLOJURE							*ft-clojure-syntax*

Setting *g:clojure_fold* enables folding Clojure code via the syntax engine.
Any list, vector, or map that extends over more than one line can be folded
using the standard Vim |fold-commands|.

Please note that this option does not work with scripts that redefine the
bracket syntax regions, such as rainbow-parentheses plugins.

This option is off by default.
>
	" Default
	let g:clojure_fold = 0
<

COBOL						*cobol.vim* *ft-cobol-syntax*

COBOL highlighting has different needs for legacy code than it does for fresh
development.  This is due to differences in what is being done (maintenance
versus development) and other factors.	To enable legacy code highlighting,
add this line to your .vimrc: >
	:let cobol_legacy_code = 1
To disable it again, use this: >
	:unlet cobol_legacy_code


COLD FUSION			*coldfusion.vim* *ft-coldfusion-syntax*

The ColdFusion has its own version of HTML comments.  To turn on ColdFusion
comment highlighting, add the following line to your startup file: >

	:let html_wrong_comments = 1

The ColdFusion syntax file is based on the HTML syntax file.


CPP						*cpp.vim* *ft-cpp-syntax*

Most of things are same as |ft-c-syntax|.

Variable		Highlight ~
cpp_no_c11		don't highlight C++11 standard items


CSH						*csh.vim* *ft-csh-syntax*

This covers the shell named "csh".  Note that on some systems tcsh is actually
used.

Detecting whether a file is csh or tcsh is notoriously hard.  Some systems
symlink /bin/csh to /bin/tcsh, making it almost impossible to distinguish
between csh and tcsh.  In case VIM guesses wrong you can set the
"filetype_csh" variable.  For using csh:  *g:filetype_csh*
>
	:let g:filetype_csh = "csh"

For using tcsh: >

	:let g:filetype_csh = "tcsh"

Any script with a tcsh extension or a standard tcsh filename (.tcshrc,
tcsh.tcshrc, tcsh.login) will have filetype tcsh.  All other tcsh/csh scripts
will be classified as tcsh, UNLESS the "filetype_csh" variable exists.  If the
"filetype_csh" variable exists, the filetype will be set to the value of the
variable.


CYNLIB						*cynlib.vim* *ft-cynlib-syntax*

Cynlib files are C++ files that use the Cynlib class library to enable
hardware modelling and simulation using C++.  Typically Cynlib files have a .cc
or a .cpp extension, which makes it very difficult to distinguish them from a
normal C++ file.  Thus, to enable Cynlib highlighting for .cc files, add this
line to your .vimrc file: >

	:let cynlib_cyntax_for_cc=1

Similarly for cpp files (this extension is only usually used in Windows) >

	:let cynlib_cyntax_for_cpp=1

To disable these again, use this: >

	:unlet cynlib_cyntax_for_cc
	:unlet cynlib_cyntax_for_cpp
<

CWEB						*cweb.vim* *ft-cweb-syntax*

Files matching "*.w" could be Progress or cweb.  If the automatic detection
doesn't work for you, or you don't edit Progress at all, use this in your
startup vimrc: >
   :let filetype_w = "cweb"


DESKTOP					   *desktop.vim* *ft-desktop-syntax*

Primary goal of this syntax file is to highlight .desktop and .directory files
according to freedesktop.org standard:
http://standards.freedesktop.org/desktop-entry-spec/latest/
But actually almost none implements this standard fully.  Thus it will
highlight all Unix ini files.  But you can force strict highlighting according
to standard by placing this in your vimrc file: >
	:let enforce_freedesktop_standard = 1


DIRCOLORS			       *dircolors.vim* *ft-dircolors-syntax*

The dircolors utility highlighting definition has one option.  It exists to
provide compatibility with the Slackware GNU/Linux distributions version of
the command.  It adds a few keywords that are generally ignored by most
versions.  On Slackware systems, however, the utility accepts the keywords and
uses them for processing.  To enable the Slackware keywords add the following
line to your startup file: >
	let dircolors_is_slackware = 1


DOCBOOK					*docbk.vim* *ft-docbk-syntax* *docbook*
DOCBOOK XML				*docbkxml.vim* *ft-docbkxml-syntax*
DOCBOOK SGML				*docbksgml.vim* *ft-docbksgml-syntax*

There are two types of DocBook files: SGML and XML.  To specify what type you
are using the "b:docbk_type" variable should be set.  Vim does this for you
automatically if it can recognize the type.  When Vim can't guess it the type
defaults to XML.
You can set the type manually: >
	:let docbk_type = "sgml"
or: >
	:let docbk_type = "xml"
You need to do this before loading the syntax file, which is complicated.
Simpler is setting the filetype to "docbkxml" or "docbksgml": >
	:set filetype=docbksgml
or: >
	:set filetype=docbkxml

You can specify the DocBook version: >
	:let docbk_ver = 3
When not set 4 is used.


DOSBATCH				*dosbatch.vim* *ft-dosbatch-syntax*

There is one option with highlighting DOS batch files.	This covers new
extensions to the Command Interpreter introduced with Windows 2000 and
is controlled by the variable dosbatch_cmdextversion.  For Windows NT
this should have the value 1, and for Windows 2000 it should be 2.
Select the version you want with the following line: >

   :let dosbatch_cmdextversion = 1

If this variable is not defined it defaults to a value of 2 to support
Windows 2000.

A second option covers whether *.btm files should be detected as type
"dosbatch" (MS-DOS batch files) or type "btm" (4DOS batch files).  The latter
is used by default.  You may select the former with the following line: >

   :let g:dosbatch_syntax_for_btm = 1

If this variable is undefined or zero, btm syntax is selected.


DOXYGEN						*doxygen.vim* *doxygen-syntax*

Doxygen generates code documentation using a special documentation format
(similar to Javadoc).  This syntax script adds doxygen highlighting to c, cpp,
idl and php files, and should also work with java.

There are a few of ways to turn on doxygen formatting. It can be done
explicitly or in a modeline by appending '.doxygen' to the syntax of the file.
Example: >
	:set syntax=c.doxygen
or >
	// vim:syntax=c.doxygen

It can also be done automatically for C, C++, C#, IDL and PHP files by setting
the global or buffer-local variable load_doxygen_syntax.  This is done by
adding the following to your .vimrc. >
	:let g:load_doxygen_syntax=1

There are a couple of variables that have an effect on syntax highlighting, and
are to do with non-standard highlighting options.

Variable			Default	Effect ~
g:doxygen_enhanced_color
g:doxygen_enhanced_colour	0	Use non-standard highlighting for
					doxygen comments.

doxygen_my_rendering		0	Disable rendering of HTML bold, italic
					and html_my_rendering underline.

doxygen_javadoc_autobrief	1	Set to 0 to disable javadoc autobrief
					colour highlighting.

doxygen_end_punctuation		'[.]'	Set to regexp match for the ending
					punctuation of brief

There are also some hilight groups worth mentioning as they can be useful in
configuration.

Highlight			Effect ~
doxygenErrorComment		The colour of an end-comment when missing
				punctuation in a code, verbatim or dot section
doxygenLinkError		The colour of an end-comment when missing the
				\endlink from a \link section.


DTD						*dtd.vim* *ft-dtd-syntax*

The DTD syntax highlighting is case sensitive by default.  To disable
case-sensitive highlighting, add the following line to your startup file: >

	:let dtd_ignore_case=1

The DTD syntax file will highlight unknown tags as errors.  If
this is annoying, it can be turned off by setting: >

	:let dtd_no_tag_errors=1

before sourcing the dtd.vim syntax file.
Parameter entity names are highlighted in the definition using the
'Type' highlighting group and 'Comment' for punctuation and '%'.
Parameter entity instances are highlighted using the 'Constant'
highlighting group and the 'Type' highlighting group for the
delimiters % and ;.  This can be turned off by setting: >

	:let dtd_no_param_entities=1

The DTD syntax file is also included by xml.vim to highlight included dtd's.


EIFFEL					*eiffel.vim* *ft-eiffel-syntax*

While Eiffel is not case-sensitive, its style guidelines are, and the
syntax highlighting file encourages their use.  This also allows to
highlight class names differently.  If you want to disable case-sensitive
highlighting, add the following line to your startup file: >

	:let eiffel_ignore_case=1

Case still matters for class names and TODO marks in comments.

Conversely, for even stricter checks, add one of the following lines: >

	:let eiffel_strict=1
	:let eiffel_pedantic=1

Setting eiffel_strict will only catch improper capitalization for the
five predefined words "Current", "Void", "Result", "Precursor", and
"NONE", to warn against their accidental use as feature or class names.

Setting eiffel_pedantic will enforce adherence to the Eiffel style
guidelines fairly rigorously (like arbitrary mixes of upper- and
lowercase letters as well as outdated ways to capitalize keywords).

If you want to use the lower-case version of "Current", "Void",
"Result", and "Precursor", you can use >

	:let eiffel_lower_case_predef=1

instead of completely turning case-sensitive highlighting off.

Support for ISE's proposed new creation syntax that is already
experimentally handled by some compilers can be enabled by: >

	:let eiffel_ise=1

Finally, some vendors support hexadecimal constants.  To handle them, add >

	:let eiffel_hex_constants=1

to your startup file.


EUPHORIA	    *euphoria3.vim* *euphoria4.vim* *ft-euphoria-syntax*

Two syntax highlighting files exists for Euphoria. One for Euphoria 
version 3.1.1, which is the default syntax highlighting file, and one for 
Euphoria version 4.0.5 or later.

Euphoria version 3.1.1 (http://www.rapideuphoria.com/) is still necessary 
for developing applications for the DOS platform, which Euphoria version 4 
(http://www.openeuphoria.org/) does not support.

The following file extensions are auto-detected as Euphoria file type: 
    
	*.e, *.eu, *.ew, *.ex, *.exu, *.exw
	*.E, *.EU, *.EW, *.EX, *.EXU, *.EXW

To select syntax highlighting file for Euphoria, as well as for 
auto-detecting the *.e and *.E file extensions as Euphoria file type,
add the following line to your startup file: >

	:let filetype_euphoria="euphoria3"

	or 

	:let filetype_euphoria="euphoria4"


ERLANG						*erlang.vim* *ft-erlang-syntax*

Erlang is a functional programming language developed by Ericsson.  Files with
the following extensions are recognized as Erlang files: erl, hrl, yaws.

The BIFs (built-in functions) are highlighted by default. To disable this,
put the following line in your vimrc: >

      :let g:erlang_highlight_bifs = 0

To enable highlighting some special atoms, put this in your vimrc: >

      :let g:erlang_highlight_special_atoms = 1


FLEXWIKI				*flexwiki.vim* *ft-flexwiki-syntax*

FlexWiki is an ASP.NET-based wiki package available at http://www.flexwiki.com
NOTE: this site currently doesn't work, on Wikipedia is mentioned that
development stopped in 2009.

Syntax highlighting is available for the most common elements of FlexWiki
syntax. The associated ftplugin script sets some buffer-local options to make
editing FlexWiki pages more convenient. FlexWiki considers a newline as the
start of a new paragraph, so the ftplugin sets 'tw'=0 (unlimited line length),
'wrap' (wrap long lines instead of using horizontal scrolling), 'linebreak'
(to wrap at a character in 'breakat' instead of at the last char on screen),
and so on. It also includes some keymaps that are disabled by default.

If you want to enable the keymaps that make "j" and "k" and the cursor keys
move up and down by display lines, add this to your .vimrc: >
	:let flexwiki_maps = 1


FORM						*form.vim* *ft-form-syntax*

The coloring scheme for syntax elements in the FORM file uses the default
modes Conditional, Number, Statement, Comment, PreProc, Type, and String,
following the language specifications in 'Symbolic Manipulation with FORM' by
J.A.M. Vermaseren, CAN, Netherlands, 1991.

If you want include your own changes to the default colors, you have to
redefine the following syntax groups:

    - formConditional
    - formNumber
    - formStatement
    - formHeaderStatement
    - formComment
    - formPreProc
    - formDirective
    - formType
    - formString

Note that the form.vim syntax file implements FORM preprocessor commands and
directives per default in the same syntax group.

A predefined enhanced color mode for FORM is available to distinguish between
header statements and statements in the body of a FORM program.  To activate
this mode define the following variable in your vimrc file >

	:let form_enhanced_color=1

The enhanced mode also takes advantage of additional color features for a dark
gvim display.  Here, statements are colored LightYellow instead of Yellow, and
conditionals are LightBlue for better distinction.


FORTRAN					*fortran.vim* *ft-fortran-syntax*

Default highlighting and dialect ~
Highlighting appropriate for Fortran 2008 is used by default.  This choice
should be appropriate for most users most of the time because Fortran 2008 is
almost a superset of previous versions (Fortran 2003, 95, 90, and 77).

Fortran source code form ~
Fortran code can be in either fixed or free source form.  Note that the
syntax highlighting will not be correct if the form is incorrectly set.

When you create a new fortran file, the syntax script assumes fixed source
form.  If you always use free source form, then >
    :let fortran_free_source=1
in your .vimrc prior to the :syntax on command.  If you always use fixed source
form, then >
    :let fortran_fixed_source=1
in your .vimrc prior to the :syntax on command.

If the form of the source code depends upon the file extension, then it is
most convenient to set fortran_free_source in a ftplugin file.  For more
information on ftplugin files, see |ftplugin|.  For example, if all your
fortran files with an .f90 extension are written in free source form and the
rest in fixed source form, add the following code to your ftplugin file >
    let s:extfname = expand("%:e")
    if s:extfname ==? "f90"
	let fortran_free_source=1
	unlet! fortran_fixed_source
    else
	let fortran_fixed_source=1
	unlet! fortran_free_source
    endif
Note that this will work only if the "filetype plugin indent on" command
precedes the "syntax on" command in your .vimrc file.

When you edit an existing fortran file, the syntax script will assume free
source form if the fortran_free_source variable has been set, and assumes
fixed source form if the fortran_fixed_source variable has been set.  If
neither of these variables have been set, the syntax script attempts to
determine which source form has been used by examining the first five columns
of the first 250 lines of your file.  If no signs of free source form are
detected, then the file is assumed to be in fixed source form.  The algorithm
should work in the vast majority of cases.  In some cases, such as a file that
begins with 250 or more full-line comments, the script may incorrectly decide
that the fortran code is in fixed form.  If that happens, just add a
non-comment statement beginning anywhere in the first five columns of the
first twenty five lines, save (:w) and then reload (:e!) the file.

Tabs in fortran files ~
Tabs are not recognized by the Fortran standards.  Tabs are not a good idea in
fixed format fortran source code which requires fixed column boundaries.
Therefore, tabs are marked as errors.  Nevertheless, some programmers like
using tabs.  If your fortran files contain tabs, then you should set the
variable fortran_have_tabs in your .vimrc with a command such as >
    :let fortran_have_tabs=1
placed prior to the :syntax on command.  Unfortunately, the use of tabs will
mean that the syntax file will not be able to detect incorrect margins.

Syntax folding of fortran files ~
If you wish to use foldmethod=syntax, then you must first set the variable
fortran_fold with a command such as >
    :let fortran_fold=1
to instruct the syntax script to define fold regions for program units, that
is main programs starting with a program statement, subroutines, function
subprograms, block data subprograms, interface blocks, and modules.  If you
also set the variable fortran_fold_conditionals with a command such as >
    :let fortran_fold_conditionals=1
then fold regions will also be defined for do loops, if blocks, and select
case constructs.  If you also set the variable
fortran_fold_multilinecomments with a command such as >
    :let fortran_fold_multilinecomments=1
then fold regions will also be defined for three or more consecutive comment
lines.  Note that defining fold regions can be slow for large files.

If fortran_fold, and possibly fortran_fold_conditionals and/or
fortran_fold_multilinecomments, have been set, then vim will fold your file if
you set foldmethod=syntax.  Comments or blank lines placed between two program
units are not folded because they are seen as not belonging to any program
unit.

More precise fortran syntax ~
If you set the variable fortran_more_precise with a command such as >
    :let fortran_more_precise=1
then the syntax coloring will be more precise but slower.  In particular,
statement labels used in do, goto and arithmetic if statements will be
recognized, as will construct names at the end of a do, if, select or forall
construct.

Non-default fortran dialects ~
The syntax script supports two Fortran dialects: f08 and F. You will probably
find the default highlighting (f08) satisfactory.  A few legacy constructs
deleted or declared obsolescent in the 2008 standard are highlighted as todo
items.

If you use F, the advantage of setting the dialect appropriately is that
other legacy features excluded from F will be highlighted as todo items and
that free source form will be assumed.

The dialect can be selected in various ways.  If all your fortran files use
the same dialect, set the global variable fortran_dialect in your .vimrc prior
to your syntax on statement.  The case-sensitive, permissible values of
fortran_dialect are "f08" or "F".  Invalid values of fortran_dialect are
ignored.

If the dialect depends upon the file extension, then it is most convenient to
set a buffer-local variable in a ftplugin file.  For more information on
ftplugin files, see |ftplugin|.  For example, if all your fortran files with
an .f90 extension are written in the F subset, your ftplugin file should
contain the code >
    let s:extfname = expand("%:e")
    if s:extfname ==? "f90"
	let b:fortran_dialect="F"
    else
	unlet! b:fortran_dialect
    endif
Note that this will work only if the "filetype plugin indent on" command
precedes the "syntax on" command in your .vimrc file.

Finer control is necessary if the file extension does not uniquely identify
the dialect.  You can override the default dialect, on a file-by-file basis,
by including a comment with the directive "fortran_dialect=xx" (where xx=F or
f08) in one of the first three lines in your file.  For example, your older .f
files may be legacy code but your newer ones may be F codes, and you would
identify the latter by including in the first three lines of those files a
Fortran comment of the form >
  ! fortran_dialect=F

For previous versions of the syntax, you may have set fortran_dialect to the
now-obsolete values "f77", "f90", "f95", or "elf". Such settings will be
silently handled as "f08". Users of "elf" may wish to experiment with "F"
instead.

The syntax/fortran.vim script contains embedded comments that tell you how to
comment and/or uncomment some lines to (a) activate recognition of some
non-standard, vendor-supplied intrinsics and (b) to prevent features deleted
or declared obsolescent in the 2008 standard from being highlighted as todo
items.

Limitations ~
Parenthesis checking does not catch too few closing parentheses.  Hollerith
strings are not recognized.  Some keywords may be highlighted incorrectly
because Fortran90 has no reserved words.

For further information related to fortran, see |ft-fortran-indent| and
|ft-fortran-plugin|.


FVWM CONFIGURATION FILES			*fvwm.vim* *ft-fvwm-syntax*

In order for Vim to recognize Fvwm configuration files that do not match
the patterns *fvwmrc* or *fvwm2rc* , you must put additional patterns
appropriate to your system in your myfiletypes.vim file.  For these
patterns, you must set the variable "b:fvwm_version" to the major version
number of Fvwm, and the 'filetype' option to fvwm.

For example, to make Vim identify all files in /etc/X11/fvwm2/
as Fvwm2 configuration files, add the following: >

  :au! BufNewFile,BufRead /etc/X11/fvwm2/*  let b:fvwm_version = 2 |
					 \ set filetype=fvwm

If you'd like Vim to highlight all valid color names, tell it where to
find the color database (rgb.txt) on your system.  Do this by setting
"rgb_file" to its location.  Assuming your color database is located
in /usr/X11/lib/X11/, you should add the line >

	:let rgb_file = "/usr/X11/lib/X11/rgb.txt"

to your .vimrc file.


GSP						*gsp.vim* *ft-gsp-syntax*

The default coloring style for GSP pages is defined by |html.vim|, and
the coloring for java code (within java tags or inline between backticks)
is defined by |java.vim|.  The following HTML groups defined in |html.vim|
are redefined to incorporate and highlight inline java code:

    htmlString
    htmlValue
    htmlEndTag
    htmlTag
    htmlTagN

Highlighting should look fine most of the places where you'd see inline
java code, but in some special cases it may not.  To add another HTML
group where you will have inline java code where it does not highlight
correctly, just copy the line you want from |html.vim| and add gspJava
to the contains clause.

The backticks for inline java are highlighted according to the htmlError
group to make them easier to see.


GROFF						*groff.vim* *ft-groff-syntax*

The groff syntax file is a wrapper for |nroff.vim|, see the notes
under that heading for examples of use and configuration.  The purpose
of this wrapper is to set up groff syntax extensions by setting the
filetype from a |modeline| or in a personal filetype definitions file
(see |filetype.txt|).


HASKELL			     *haskell.vim* *lhaskell.vim* *ft-haskell-syntax*

The Haskell syntax files support plain Haskell code as well as literate
Haskell code, the latter in both Bird style and TeX style.  The Haskell
syntax highlighting will also highlight C preprocessor directives.

If you want to highlight delimiter characters (useful if you have a
light-coloured background), add to your .vimrc: >
	:let hs_highlight_delimiters = 1
To treat True and False as keywords as opposed to ordinary identifiers,
add: >
	:let hs_highlight_boolean = 1
To also treat the names of primitive types as keywords: >
	:let hs_highlight_types = 1
And to treat the names of even more relatively common types as keywords: >
	:let hs_highlight_more_types = 1
If you want to highlight the names of debugging functions, put in
your .vimrc: >
	:let hs_highlight_debug = 1

The Haskell syntax highlighting also highlights C preprocessor
directives, and flags lines that start with # but are not valid
directives as erroneous.  This interferes with Haskell's syntax for
operators, as they may start with #.  If you want to highlight those
as operators as opposed to errors, put in your .vimrc: >
	:let hs_allow_hash_operator = 1

The syntax highlighting for literate Haskell code will try to
automatically guess whether your literate Haskell code contains
TeX markup or not, and correspondingly highlight TeX constructs
or nothing at all.  You can override this globally by putting
in your .vimrc >
	:let lhs_markup = none
for no highlighting at all, or >
	:let lhs_markup = tex
to force the highlighting to always try to highlight TeX markup.
For more flexibility, you may also use buffer local versions of
this variable, so e.g. >
	:let b:lhs_markup = tex
will force TeX highlighting for a particular buffer.  It has to be
set before turning syntax highlighting on for the buffer or
loading a file.


HTML						*html.vim* *ft-html-syntax*

The coloring scheme for tags in the HTML file works as follows.

The  <> of opening tags are colored differently than the </> of a closing tag.
This is on purpose! For opening tags the 'Function' color is used, while for
closing tags the 'Type' color is used (See syntax.vim to check how those are
defined for you)

Known tag names are colored the same way as statements in C.  Unknown tag
names are colored with the same color as the <> or </> respectively which
makes it easy to spot errors

Note that the same is true for argument (or attribute) names.  Known attribute
names are colored differently than unknown ones.

Some HTML tags are used to change the rendering of text.  The following tags
are recognized by the html.vim syntax coloring file and change the way normal
text is shown: <B> <I> <U> <EM> <STRONG> (<EM> is used as an alias for <I>,
while <STRONG> as an alias for <B>), <H1> - <H6>, <HEAD>, <TITLE> and <A>, but
only if used as a link (that is, it must include a href as in
<A href="somefile.html">).

If you want to change how such text is rendered, you must redefine the
following syntax groups:

    - htmlBold
    - htmlBoldUnderline
    - htmlBoldUnderlineItalic
    - htmlUnderline
    - htmlUnderlineItalic
    - htmlItalic
    - htmlTitle for titles
    - htmlH1 - htmlH6 for headings

To make this redefinition work you must redefine them all with the exception
of the last two (htmlTitle and htmlH[1-6], which are optional) and define the
following variable in your vimrc (this is due to the order in which the files
are read during initialization) >
	:let html_my_rendering=1

If you'd like to see an example download mysyntax.vim at
http://www.fleiner.com/vim/download.html

You can also disable this rendering by adding the following line to your
vimrc file: >
	:let html_no_rendering=1

HTML comments are rather special (see an HTML reference document for the
details), and the syntax coloring scheme will highlight all errors.
However, if you prefer to use the wrong style (starts with <!-- and
ends with -->) you can define >
	:let html_wrong_comments=1

JavaScript and Visual Basic embedded inside HTML documents are highlighted as
'Special' with statements, comments, strings and so on colored as in standard
programming languages.  Note that only JavaScript and Visual Basic are currently
supported, no other scripting language has been added yet.

Embedded and inlined cascading style sheets (CSS) are highlighted too.

There are several html preprocessor languages out there.  html.vim has been
written such that it should be trivial to include it.  To do so add the
following two lines to the syntax coloring file for that language
(the example comes from the asp.vim file):

    runtime! syntax/html.vim
    syn cluster htmlPreproc add=asp

Now you just need to make sure that you add all regions that contain
the preprocessor language to the cluster htmlPreproc.


HTML/OS (by Aestiva)				*htmlos.vim* *ft-htmlos-syntax*

The coloring scheme for HTML/OS works as follows:

Functions and variable names are the same color by default, because VIM
doesn't specify different colors for Functions and Identifiers.  To change
this (which is recommended if you want function names to be recognizable in a
different color) you need to add the following line to either your ~/.vimrc: >
  :hi Function term=underline cterm=bold ctermfg=LightGray

Of course, the ctermfg can be a different color if you choose.

Another issues that HTML/OS runs into is that there is no special filetype to
signify that it is a file with HTML/OS coding.	You can change this by opening
a file and turning on HTML/OS syntax by doing the following: >
  :set syntax=htmlos

Lastly, it should be noted that the opening and closing characters to begin a
block of HTML/OS code can either be << or [[ and >> or ]], respectively.


IA64				*ia64.vim* *intel-itanium* *ft-ia64-syntax*

Highlighting for the Intel Itanium 64 assembly language.  See |asm.vim| for
how to recognize this filetype.

To have *.inc files be recognized as IA64, add this to your .vimrc file: >
	:let g:filetype_inc = "ia64"


INFORM						*inform.vim* *ft-inform-syntax*

Inform highlighting includes symbols provided by the Inform Library, as
most programs make extensive use of it.  If do not wish Library symbols
to be highlighted add this to your vim startup: >
	:let inform_highlight_simple=1

By default it is assumed that Inform programs are Z-machine targeted,
and highlights Z-machine assembly language symbols appropriately.  If
you intend your program to be targeted to a Glulx/Glk environment you
need to add this to your startup sequence: >
	:let inform_highlight_glulx=1

This will highlight Glulx opcodes instead, and also adds glk() to the
set of highlighted system functions.

The Inform compiler will flag certain obsolete keywords as errors when
it encounters them.  These keywords are normally highlighted as errors
by Vim.  To prevent such error highlighting, you must add this to your
startup sequence: >
	:let inform_suppress_obsolete=1

By default, the language features highlighted conform to Compiler
version 6.30 and Library version 6.11.  If you are using an older
Inform development environment, you may with to add this to your
startup sequence: >
	:let inform_highlight_old=1

IDL							*idl.vim* *idl-syntax*

IDL (Interface Definition Language) files are used to define RPC calls.  In
Microsoft land, this is also used for defining COM interfaces and calls.

IDL's structure is simple enough to permit a full grammar based approach to
rather than using a few heuristics.  The result is large and somewhat
repetitive but seems to work.

There are some Microsoft extensions to idl files that are here.  Some of them
are disabled by defining idl_no_ms_extensions.

The more complex of the extensions are disabled by defining idl_no_extensions.

Variable			Effect ~

idl_no_ms_extensions		Disable some of the Microsoft specific
				extensions
idl_no_extensions		Disable complex extensions
idlsyntax_showerror		Show IDL errors (can be rather intrusive, but
				quite helpful)
idlsyntax_showerror_soft	Use softer colours by default for errors


JAVA						*java.vim* *ft-java-syntax*

The java.vim syntax highlighting file offers several options:

In Java 1.0.2 it was never possible to have braces inside parens, so this was
flagged as an error.  Since Java 1.1 this is possible (with anonymous
classes), and therefore is no longer marked as an error.  If you prefer the old
way, put the following line into your vim startup file: >
	:let java_mark_braces_in_parens_as_errors=1

All identifiers in java.lang.* are always visible in all classes.  To
highlight them use: >
	:let java_highlight_java_lang_ids=1

You can also highlight identifiers of most standard Java packages if you
download the javaid.vim script at http://www.fleiner.com/vim/download.html.
If you prefer to only highlight identifiers of a certain package, say java.io
use the following: >
	:let java_highlight_java_io=1
Check the javaid.vim file for a list of all the packages that are supported.

Function names are not highlighted, as the way to find functions depends on
how you write Java code.  The syntax file knows two possible ways to highlight
functions:

If you write function declarations that are always indented by either
a tab, 8 spaces or 2 spaces you may want to set >
	:let java_highlight_functions="indent"
However, if you follow the Java guidelines about how functions and classes are
supposed to be named (with respect to upper and lowercase), use >
	:let java_highlight_functions="style"
If both options do not work for you, but you would still want function
declarations to be highlighted create your own definitions by changing the
definitions in java.vim or by creating your own java.vim which includes the
original one and then adds the code to highlight functions.

In Java 1.1 the functions System.out.println() and System.err.println() should
only be used for debugging.  Therefore it is possible to highlight debugging
statements differently.  To do this you must add the following definition in
your startup file: >
	:let java_highlight_debug=1
The result will be that those statements are highlighted as 'Special'
characters.  If you prefer to have them highlighted differently you must define
new highlightings for the following groups.:
    Debug, DebugSpecial, DebugString, DebugBoolean, DebugType
which are used for the statement itself, special characters used in debug
strings, strings, boolean constants and types (this, super) respectively.  I
have opted to chose another background for those statements.

Javadoc is a program that takes special comments out of Java program files and
creates HTML pages.  The standard configuration will highlight this HTML code
similarly to HTML files (see |html.vim|).  You can even add Javascript
and CSS inside this code (see below).  There are four differences however:
  1. The title (all characters up to the first '.' which is followed by
     some white space or up to the first '@') is colored differently (to change
     the color change the group CommentTitle).
  2. The text is colored as 'Comment'.
  3. HTML comments are colored as 'Special'
  4. The special Javadoc tags (@see, @param, ...) are highlighted as specials
     and the argument (for @see, @param, @exception) as Function.
To turn this feature off add the following line to your startup file: >
	:let java_ignore_javadoc=1

If you use the special Javadoc comment highlighting described above you
can also turn on special highlighting for Javascript, visual basic
scripts and embedded CSS (stylesheets).  This makes only sense if you
actually have Javadoc comments that include either Javascript or embedded
CSS.  The options to use are >
	:let java_javascript=1
	:let java_css=1
	:let java_vb=1

In order to highlight nested parens with different colors define colors
for javaParen, javaParen1 and javaParen2, for example with >
	:hi link javaParen Comment
or >
	:hi javaParen ctermfg=blue guifg=#0000ff

If you notice highlighting errors while scrolling backwards, which are fixed
when redrawing with CTRL-L, try setting the "java_minlines" internal variable
to a larger number: >
	:let java_minlines = 50
This will make the syntax synchronization start 50 lines before the first
displayed line.  The default value is 10.  The disadvantage of using a larger
number is that redrawing can become slow.


LACE						*lace.vim* *ft-lace-syntax*

Lace (Language for Assembly of Classes in Eiffel) is case insensitive, but the
style guide lines are not.  If you prefer case insensitive highlighting, just
define the vim variable 'lace_case_insensitive' in your startup file: >
	:let lace_case_insensitive=1


LEX						*lex.vim* *ft-lex-syntax*

Lex uses brute-force synchronizing as the "^%%$" section delimiter
gives no clue as to what section follows.  Consequently, the value for >
	:syn sync minlines=300
may be changed by the user if s/he is experiencing synchronization
difficulties (such as may happen with large lex files).


LIFELINES				*lifelines.vim* *ft-lifelines-syntax*

To highlight deprecated functions as errors, add in your .vimrc: >

	:let g:lifelines_deprecated = 1
<

LISP						*lisp.vim* *ft-lisp-syntax*

The lisp syntax highlighting provides two options: >

	g:lisp_instring : if it exists, then "(...)" strings are highlighted
			  as if the contents of the string were lisp.
			  Useful for AutoLisp.
	g:lisp_rainbow  : if it exists and is nonzero, then differing levels
			  of parenthesization will receive different
			  highlighting.
<
The g:lisp_rainbow option provides 10 levels of individual colorization for
the parentheses and backquoted parentheses.  Because of the quantity of
colorization levels, unlike non-rainbow highlighting, the rainbow mode
specifies its highlighting using ctermfg and guifg, thereby bypassing the
usual colorscheme control using standard highlighting groups.  The actual
highlighting used depends on the dark/bright setting  (see |'bg'|).


LITE						*lite.vim* *ft-lite-syntax*

There are two options for the lite syntax highlighting.

If you like SQL syntax highlighting inside Strings, use this: >

	:let lite_sql_query = 1

For syncing, minlines defaults to 100.	If you prefer another value, you can
set "lite_minlines" to the value you desire.  Example: >

	:let lite_minlines = 200


LPC						*lpc.vim* *ft-lpc-syntax*

LPC stands for a simple, memory-efficient language: Lars Pensj| C.  The
file name of LPC is usually *.c.  Recognizing these files as LPC would bother
users writing only C programs.	If you want to use LPC syntax in Vim, you
should set a variable in your .vimrc file: >

	:let lpc_syntax_for_c = 1

If it doesn't work properly for some particular C or LPC files, use a
modeline.  For a LPC file:

	// vim:set ft=lpc:

For a C file that is recognized as LPC:

	// vim:set ft=c:

If you don't want to set the variable, use the modeline in EVERY LPC file.

There are several implementations for LPC, we intend to support most widely
used ones.  Here the default LPC syntax is for MudOS series, for MudOS v22
and before, you should turn off the sensible modifiers, and this will also
assert the new efuns after v22 to be invalid, don't set this variable when
you are using the latest version of MudOS: >

	:let lpc_pre_v22 = 1

For LpMud 3.2 series of LPC: >

	:let lpc_compat_32 = 1

For LPC4 series of LPC: >

	:let lpc_use_lpc4_syntax = 1

For uLPC series of LPC:
uLPC has been developed to Pike, so you should use Pike syntax
instead, and the name of your source file should be *.pike


LUA						*lua.vim* *ft-lua-syntax*

The Lua syntax file can be used for versions 4.0, 5.0, 5.1 and 5.2 (5.2 is
the default). You can select one of these versions using the global variables
lua_version and lua_subversion. For example, to activate Lua
5.1 syntax highlighting, set the variables like this:

	:let lua_version = 5
	:let lua_subversion = 1


MAIL						*mail.vim* *ft-mail.vim*

Vim highlights all the standard elements of an email (headers, signatures,
quoted text and URLs / email addresses).  In keeping with standard conventions,
signatures begin in a line containing only "--" followed optionally by
whitespaces and end with a newline.

Vim treats lines beginning with ']', '}', '|', '>' or a word followed by '>'
as quoted text.  However Vim highlights headers and signatures in quoted text
only if the text is quoted with '>' (optionally followed by one space).

By default mail.vim synchronises syntax to 100 lines before the first
displayed line.  If you have a slow machine, and generally deal with emails
with short headers, you can change this to a smaller value: >

    :let mail_minlines = 30


MAKE						*make.vim* *ft-make-syntax*

In makefiles, commands are usually highlighted to make it easy for you to spot
errors.  However, this may be too much coloring for you.  You can turn this
feature off by using: >

	:let make_no_commands = 1


MAPLE						*maple.vim* *ft-maple-syntax*

Maple V, by Waterloo Maple Inc, supports symbolic algebra.  The language
supports many packages of functions which are selectively loaded by the user.
The standard set of packages' functions as supplied in Maple V release 4 may be
highlighted at the user's discretion.  Users may place in their .vimrc file: >

	:let mvpkg_all= 1

to get all package functions highlighted, or users may select any subset by
choosing a variable/package from the table below and setting that variable to
1, also in their .vimrc file (prior to sourcing
$VIMRUNTIME/syntax/syntax.vim).

	Table of Maple V Package Function Selectors >
  mv_DEtools	 mv_genfunc	mv_networks	mv_process
  mv_Galois	 mv_geometry	mv_numapprox	mv_simplex
  mv_GaussInt	 mv_grobner	mv_numtheory	mv_stats
  mv_LREtools	 mv_group	mv_orthopoly	mv_student
  mv_combinat	 mv_inttrans	mv_padic	mv_sumtools
  mv_combstruct mv_liesymm	mv_plots	mv_tensor
  mv_difforms	 mv_linalg	mv_plottools	mv_totorder
  mv_finance	 mv_logic	mv_powseries


MATHEMATICA		*mma.vim* *ft-mma-syntax* *ft-mathematica-syntax*

Empty *.m files will automatically be presumed to be Matlab files unless you
have the following in your .vimrc: >

	let filetype_m = "mma"


MOO						*moo.vim* *ft-moo-syntax*

If you use C-style comments inside expressions and find it mangles your
highlighting, you may want to use extended (slow!) matches for C-style
comments: >

	:let moo_extended_cstyle_comments = 1

To disable highlighting of pronoun substitution patterns inside strings: >

	:let moo_no_pronoun_sub = 1

To disable highlighting of the regular expression operator '%|', and matching
'%(' and '%)' inside strings: >

	:let moo_no_regexp = 1

Unmatched double quotes can be recognized and highlighted as errors: >

	:let moo_unmatched_quotes = 1

To highlight builtin properties (.name, .location, .programmer etc.): >

	:let moo_builtin_properties = 1

Unknown builtin functions can be recognized and highlighted as errors.  If you
use this option, add your own extensions to the mooKnownBuiltinFunction group.
To enable this option: >

	:let moo_unknown_builtin_functions = 1

An example of adding sprintf() to the list of known builtin functions: >

	:syn keyword mooKnownBuiltinFunction sprintf contained


MSQL						*msql.vim* *ft-msql-syntax*

There are two options for the msql syntax highlighting.

If you like SQL syntax highlighting inside Strings, use this: >

	:let msql_sql_query = 1

For syncing, minlines defaults to 100.	If you prefer another value, you can
set "msql_minlines" to the value you desire.  Example: >

	:let msql_minlines = 200


NCF						*ncf.vim* *ft-ncf-syntax*

There is one option for NCF syntax highlighting.

If you want to have unrecognized (by ncf.vim) statements highlighted as
errors, use this: >

	:let ncf_highlight_unknowns = 1

If you don't want to highlight these errors, leave it unset.


NROFF						*nroff.vim* *ft-nroff-syntax*

The nroff syntax file works with AT&T n/troff out of the box.  You need to
activate the GNU groff extra features included in the syntax file before you
can use them.

For example, Linux and BSD distributions use groff as their default text
processing package.  In order to activate the extra syntax highlighting
features for groff, add the following option to your start-up files: >

  :let b:nroff_is_groff = 1

Groff is different from the old AT&T n/troff that you may still find in
Solaris.  Groff macro and request names can be longer than 2 characters and
there are extensions to the language primitives.  For example, in AT&T troff
you access the year as a 2-digit number with the request \(yr.  In groff you
can use the same request, recognized for compatibility, or you can use groff's
native syntax, \[yr].  Furthermore, you can use a 4-digit year directly:
\[year].  Macro requests can be longer than 2 characters, for example, GNU mm
accepts the requests ".VERBON" and ".VERBOFF" for creating verbatim
environments.

In order to obtain the best formatted output g/troff can give you, you should
follow a few simple rules about spacing and punctuation.

1. Do not leave empty spaces at the end of lines.

2. Leave one space and one space only after an end-of-sentence period,
   exclamation mark, etc.

3. For reasons stated below, it is best to follow all period marks with a
   carriage return.

The reason behind these unusual tips is that g/n/troff have a line breaking
algorithm that can be easily upset if you don't follow the rules given above.

Unlike TeX, troff fills text line-by-line, not paragraph-by-paragraph and,
furthermore, it does not have a concept of glue or stretch, all horizontal and
vertical space input will be output as is.

Therefore, you should be careful about not using more space between sentences
than you intend to have in your final document.  For this reason, the common
practice is to insert a carriage return immediately after all punctuation
marks.  If you want to have "even" text in your final processed output, you
need to maintain regular spacing in the input text.  To mark both trailing
spaces and two or more spaces after a punctuation as an error, use: >

  :let nroff_space_errors = 1

Another technique to detect extra spacing and other errors that will interfere
with the correct typesetting of your file, is to define an eye-catching
highlighting definition for the syntax groups "nroffDefinition" and
"nroffDefSpecial" in your configuration files.  For example: >

  hi def nroffDefinition term=italic cterm=italic gui=reverse
  hi def nroffDefSpecial term=italic,bold cterm=italic,bold
			 \ gui=reverse,bold

If you want to navigate preprocessor entries in your source file as easily as
with section markers, you can activate the following option in your .vimrc
file: >

	let b:preprocs_as_sections = 1

As well, the syntax file adds an extra paragraph marker for the extended
paragraph macro (.XP) in the ms package.

Finally, there is a |groff.vim| syntax file that can be used for enabling
groff syntax highlighting either on a file basis or globally by default.


OCAML						*ocaml.vim* *ft-ocaml-syntax*

The OCaml syntax file handles files having the following prefixes: .ml,
.mli, .mll and .mly.  By setting the following variable >

	:let ocaml_revised = 1

you can switch from standard OCaml-syntax to revised syntax as supported
by the camlp4 preprocessor.  Setting the variable >

	:let ocaml_noend_error = 1

prevents highlighting of "end" as error, which is useful when sources
contain very long structures that Vim does not synchronize anymore.


PAPP						*papp.vim* *ft-papp-syntax*

The PApp syntax file handles .papp files and, to a lesser extend, .pxml
and .pxsl files which are all a mixture of perl/xml/html/other using xml
as the top-level file format.  By default everything inside phtml or pxml
sections is treated as a string with embedded preprocessor commands.  If
you set the variable: >

	:let papp_include_html=1

in your startup file it will try to syntax-hilight html code inside phtml
sections, but this is relatively slow and much too colourful to be able to
edit sensibly. ;)

The newest version of the papp.vim syntax file can usually be found at
http://papp.plan9.de.


PASCAL						*pascal.vim* *ft-pascal-syntax*

Files matching "*.p" could be Progress or Pascal.  If the automatic detection
doesn't work for you, or you don't edit Progress at all, use this in your
startup vimrc: >

   :let filetype_p = "pascal"

The Pascal syntax file has been extended to take into account some extensions
provided by Turbo Pascal, Free Pascal Compiler and GNU Pascal Compiler.
Delphi keywords are also supported.  By default, Turbo Pascal 7.0 features are
enabled.  If you prefer to stick with the standard Pascal keywords, add the
following line to your startup file: >

   :let pascal_traditional=1

To switch on Delphi specific constructions (such as one-line comments,
keywords, etc): >

   :let pascal_delphi=1


The option pascal_symbol_operator controls whether symbol operators such as +,
*, .., etc. are displayed using the Operator color or not.  To colorize symbol
operators, add the following line to your startup file: >

   :let pascal_symbol_operator=1

Some functions are highlighted by default.  To switch it off: >

   :let pascal_no_functions=1

Furthermore, there are specific variables for some compilers.  Besides
pascal_delphi, there are pascal_gpc and pascal_fpc.  Default extensions try to
match Turbo Pascal. >

   :let pascal_gpc=1

or >

   :let pascal_fpc=1

To ensure that strings are defined on a single line, you can define the
pascal_one_line_string variable. >

   :let pascal_one_line_string=1

If you dislike <Tab> chars, you can set the pascal_no_tabs variable.  Tabs
will be highlighted as Error. >

   :let pascal_no_tabs=1



PERL						*perl.vim* *ft-perl-syntax*

There are a number of possible options to the perl syntax highlighting.

Inline POD highlighting is now turned on by default.  If you don't wish
to have the added complexity of highlighting POD embedded within Perl
files, you may set the 'perl_include_pod' option to 0: >

	:let perl_include_pod = 0

To reduce the complexity of parsing (and increase performance) you can switch
off two elements in the parsing of variable names and contents. >

To handle package references in variable and function names not differently
from the rest of the name (like 'PkgName::' in '$PkgName::VarName'): >

	:let perl_no_scope_in_variables = 1

(In Vim 6.x it was the other way around: "perl_want_scope_in_variables"
enabled it.)

If you do not want complex things like '@{${"foo"}}' to be parsed: >

	:let perl_no_extended_vars = 1

(In Vim 6.x it was the other way around: "perl_extended_vars" enabled it.)

The coloring strings can be changed.  By default strings and qq friends will be
highlighted like the first line.  If you set the variable
perl_string_as_statement, it will be highlighted as in the second line.

   "hello world!"; qq|hello world|;
   ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^NN^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^N	  (unlet perl_string_as_statement)
   S^^^^^^^^^^^^SNNSSS^^^^^^^^^^^SN	  (let perl_string_as_statement)

(^ = perlString, S = perlStatement, N = None at all)

The syncing has 3 options.  The first two switch off some triggering of
synchronization and should only be needed in case it fails to work properly.
If while scrolling all of a sudden the whole screen changes color completely
then you should try and switch off one of those.  Let me know if you can figure
out the line that causes the mistake.

One triggers on "^\s*sub\s*" and the other on "^[$@%]" more or less. >

	:let perl_no_sync_on_sub
	:let perl_no_sync_on_global_var

Below you can set the maximum distance VIM should look for starting points for
its attempts in syntax highlighting. >

	:let perl_sync_dist = 100

If you want to use folding with perl, set perl_fold: >

	:let perl_fold = 1

If you want to fold blocks in if statements, etc. as well set the following: >

	:let perl_fold_blocks = 1

Subroutines are folded by default if 'perl_fold' is set.  If you do not want
this, you can set 'perl_nofold_subs': >

	:let perl_nofold_subs = 1

Anonymous subroutines are not folded by default; you may enable their folding
via 'perl_fold_anonymous_subs': >

	:let perl_fold_anonymous_subs = 1

Packages are also folded by default if 'perl_fold' is set.  To disable this
behavior, set 'perl_nofold_packages': >

	:let perl_nofold_packages = 1

PHP3 and PHP4		*php.vim* *php3.vim* *ft-php-syntax* *ft-php3-syntax*

[note: previously this was called "php3", but since it now also supports php4
it has been renamed to "php"]

There are the following options for the php syntax highlighting.

If you like SQL syntax highlighting inside Strings: >

  let php_sql_query = 1

For highlighting the Baselib methods: >

  let php_baselib = 1

Enable HTML syntax highlighting inside strings: >

  let php_htmlInStrings = 1

Using the old colorstyle: >

  let php_oldStyle = 1

Enable highlighting ASP-style short tags: >

  let php_asp_tags = 1

Disable short tags: >

  let php_noShortTags = 1

For highlighting parent error ] or ): >

  let php_parent_error_close = 1

For skipping a php end tag, if there exists an open ( or [ without a closing
one: >

  let php_parent_error_open = 1

Enable folding for classes and functions: >

  let php_folding = 1

Selecting syncing method: >

  let php_sync_method = x

x = -1 to sync by search (default),
x > 0 to sync at least x lines backwards,
x = 0 to sync from start.


PLAINTEX				*plaintex.vim* *ft-plaintex-syntax*

TeX is a typesetting language, and plaintex is the file type for the "plain"
variant of TeX.  If you never want your *.tex files recognized as plain TeX,
see |ft-tex-plugin|.

This syntax file has the option >

	let g:plaintex_delimiters = 1

if you want to highlight brackets "[]" and braces "{}".


PPWIZARD					*ppwiz.vim* *ft-ppwiz-syntax*

PPWizard is a preprocessor for HTML and OS/2 INF files

This syntax file has the options:

- ppwiz_highlight_defs : determines highlighting mode for PPWizard's
  definitions.  Possible values are

  ppwiz_highlight_defs = 1 : PPWizard #define statements retain the
    colors of their contents (e.g. PPWizard macros and variables)

  ppwiz_highlight_defs = 2 : preprocessor #define and #evaluate
    statements are shown in a single color with the exception of line
    continuation symbols

  The default setting for ppwiz_highlight_defs is 1.

- ppwiz_with_html : If the value is 1 (the default), highlight literal
  HTML code; if 0, treat HTML code like ordinary text.


PHTML						*phtml.vim* *ft-phtml-syntax*

There are two options for the phtml syntax highlighting.

If you like SQL syntax highlighting inside Strings, use this: >

	:let phtml_sql_query = 1

For syncing, minlines defaults to 100.	If you prefer another value, you can
set "phtml_minlines" to the value you desire.  Example: >

	:let phtml_minlines = 200


POSTSCRIPT				*postscr.vim* *ft-postscr-syntax*

There are several options when it comes to highlighting PostScript.

First which version of the PostScript language to highlight.  There are
currently three defined language versions, or levels.  Level 1 is the original
and base version, and includes all extensions prior to the release of level 2.
Level 2 is the most common version around, and includes its own set of
extensions prior to the release of level 3.  Level 3 is currently the highest
level supported.  You select which level of the PostScript language you want
highlighted by defining the postscr_level variable as follows: >

	:let postscr_level=2

If this variable is not defined it defaults to 2 (level 2) since this is
the most prevalent version currently.

Note, not all PS interpreters will support all language features for a
particular language level.  In particular the %!PS-Adobe-3.0 at the start of
PS files does NOT mean the PostScript present is level 3 PostScript!

If you are working with Display PostScript, you can include highlighting of
Display PS language features by defining the postscr_display variable as
follows: >

	:let postscr_display=1

If you are working with Ghostscript, you can include highlighting of
Ghostscript specific language features by defining the variable
postscr_ghostscript as follows: >

	:let postscr_ghostscript=1

PostScript is a large language, with many predefined elements.	While it
useful to have all these elements highlighted, on slower machines this can
cause Vim to slow down.  In an attempt to be machine friendly font names and
character encodings are not highlighted by default.  Unless you are working
explicitly with either of these this should be ok.  If you want them to be
highlighted you should set one or both of the following variables: >

	:let postscr_fonts=1
	:let postscr_encodings=1

There is a stylistic option to the highlighting of and, or, and not.  In
PostScript the function of these operators depends on the types of their
operands - if the operands are booleans then they are the logical operators,
if they are integers then they are binary operators.  As binary and logical
operators can be highlighted differently they have to be highlighted one way
or the other.  By default they are treated as logical operators.  They can be
highlighted as binary operators by defining the variable
postscr_andornot_binary as follows: >

	:let postscr_andornot_binary=1
<

			*ptcap.vim* *ft-printcap-syntax*
PRINTCAP + TERMCAP	*ft-ptcap-syntax* *ft-termcap-syntax*

This syntax file applies to the printcap and termcap databases.

In order for Vim to recognize printcap/termcap files that do not match
the patterns *printcap*, or *termcap*, you must put additional patterns
appropriate to your system in your |myfiletypefile| file.  For these
patterns, you must set the variable "b:ptcap_type" to either "print" or
"term", and then the 'filetype' option to ptcap.

For example, to make Vim identify all files in /etc/termcaps/ as termcap
files, add the following: >

   :au BufNewFile,BufRead /etc/termcaps/* let b:ptcap_type = "term" |
				       \ set filetype=ptcap

If you notice highlighting errors while scrolling backwards, which
are fixed when redrawing with CTRL-L, try setting the "ptcap_minlines"
internal variable to a larger number: >

   :let ptcap_minlines = 50

(The default is 20 lines.)


PROGRESS				*progress.vim* *ft-progress-syntax*

Files matching "*.w" could be Progress or cweb.  If the automatic detection
doesn't work for you, or you don't edit cweb at all, use this in your
startup vimrc: >
   :let filetype_w = "progress"
The same happens for "*.i", which could be assembly, and "*.p", which could be
Pascal.  Use this if you don't use assembly and Pascal: >
   :let filetype_i = "progress"
   :let filetype_p = "progress"


PYTHON						*python.vim* *ft-python-syntax*

There are six options to control Python syntax highlighting.

For highlighted numbers: >
	:let python_no_number_highlight = 1

For highlighted builtin functions: >
	:let python_no_builtin_highlight = 1

For highlighted standard exceptions: >
	:let python_no_exception_highlight = 1

For highlighted doctests and code inside: >
	:let python_no_doctest_highlight = 1
or >
	:let python_no_doctest_code_highlight = 1
(first option implies second one).

For highlighted trailing whitespace and mix of spaces and tabs: >
	:let python_space_error_highlight = 1

If you want all possible Python highlighting (the same as setting the
preceding last option and unsetting all other ones): >
	:let python_highlight_all = 1

Note: only existence of these options matter, not their value. You can replace
      1 above with anything.


QUAKE						*quake.vim* *ft-quake-syntax*

The Quake syntax definition should work for most any FPS (First Person
Shooter) based on one of the Quake engines.  However, the command names vary
a bit between the three games (Quake, Quake 2, and Quake 3 Arena) so the
syntax definition checks for the existence of three global variables to allow
users to specify what commands are legal in their files.  The three variables
can be set for the following effects:

set to highlight commands only available in Quake: >
	:let quake_is_quake1 = 1

set to highlight commands only available in Quake 2: >
	:let quake_is_quake2 = 1

set to highlight commands only available in Quake 3 Arena: >
	:let quake_is_quake3 = 1

Any combination of these three variables is legal, but might highlight more
commands than are actually available to you by the game.


READLINE				*readline.vim* *ft-readline-syntax*

The readline library is primarily used by the BASH shell, which adds quite a
few commands and options to the ones already available.  To highlight these
items as well you can add the following to your |vimrc| or just type it in the
command line before loading a file with the readline syntax: >
	let readline_has_bash = 1

This will add highlighting for the commands that BASH (version 2.05a and
later, and part earlier) adds.


RESTRUCTURED TEXT			*rst.vim* *ft-rst-syntax*

You may set what syntax definitions should be used for code blocks via
	let rst_syntax_code_list = ['vim', 'lisp', ...]


REXX						*rexx.vim* *ft-rexx-syntax*

If you notice highlighting errors while scrolling backwards, which are fixed
when redrawing with CTRL-L, try setting the "rexx_minlines" internal variable
to a larger number: >
	:let rexx_minlines = 50
This will make the syntax synchronization start 50 lines before the first
displayed line.  The default value is 10.  The disadvantage of using a larger
number is that redrawing can become slow.

Vim tries to guess what type a ".r" file is.  If it can't be detected (from
comment lines), the default is "r".  To make the default rexx add this line to
your .vimrc:  *g:filetype_r*
>
	:let g:filetype_r = "r"


RUBY						*ruby.vim* *ft-ruby-syntax*

There are a number of options to the Ruby syntax highlighting.

By default, the "end" keyword is colorized according to the opening statement
of the block it closes.  While useful, this feature can be expensive; if you
experience slow redrawing (or you are on a terminal with poor color support)
you may want to turn it off by defining the "ruby_no_expensive" variable: >

	:let ruby_no_expensive = 1
<
In this case the same color will be used for all control keywords.

If you do want this feature enabled, but notice highlighting errors while
scrolling backwards, which are fixed when redrawing with CTRL-L, try setting
the "ruby_minlines" variable to a value larger than 50: >

	:let ruby_minlines = 100
<
Ideally, this value should be a number of lines large enough to embrace your
largest class or module.

Highlighting of special identifiers can be disabled by removing the
rubyIdentifier highlighting: >

	:hi link rubyIdentifier NONE
<
This will prevent highlighting of special identifiers like "ConstantName",
"$global_var", "@@class_var", "@instance_var", "| block_param |", and
":symbol".

Significant methods of Kernel, Module and Object are highlighted by default.
This can be disabled by defining "ruby_no_special_methods": >

	:let ruby_no_special_methods = 1
<
This will prevent highlighting of important methods such as "require", "attr",
"private", "raise" and "proc".

Ruby operators can be highlighted. This is enabled by defining
"ruby_operators": >

	:let ruby_operators = 1
<
Whitespace errors can be highlighted by defining "ruby_space_errors": >

	:let ruby_space_errors = 1
<
This will highlight trailing whitespace and tabs preceded by a space character
as errors.  This can be refined by defining "ruby_no_trail_space_error" and
"ruby_no_tab_space_error" which will ignore trailing whitespace and tabs after
spaces respectively.

Folding can be enabled by defining "ruby_fold": >

	:let ruby_fold = 1
<
This will set the 'foldmethod' option to "syntax" and allow folding of
classes, modules, methods, code blocks, heredocs and comments.

Folding of multiline comments can be disabled by defining
"ruby_no_comment_fold": >

	:let ruby_no_comment_fold = 1
<

SCHEME						*scheme.vim* *ft-scheme-syntax*

By default only R5RS keywords are highlighted and properly indented.

MzScheme-specific stuff will be used if b:is_mzscheme or g:is_mzscheme
variables are defined.

Also scheme.vim supports keywords of the Chicken Scheme->C compiler.  Define
b:is_chicken or g:is_chicken, if you need them.


SDL						*sdl.vim* *ft-sdl-syntax*

The SDL highlighting probably misses a few keywords, but SDL has so many
of them it's almost impossibly to cope.

The new standard, SDL-2000, specifies that all identifiers are
case-sensitive (which was not so before), and that all keywords can be
used either completely lowercase or completely uppercase.  To have the
highlighting reflect this, you can set the following variable: >
	:let sdl_2000=1

This also sets many new keywords.  If you want to disable the old
keywords, which is probably a good idea, use: >
	:let SDL_no_96=1


The indentation is probably also incomplete, but right now I am very
satisfied with it for my own projects.


SED						*sed.vim* *ft-sed-syntax*

To make tabs stand out from regular blanks (accomplished by using Todo
highlighting on the tabs), define "highlight_sedtabs" by putting >

	:let highlight_sedtabs = 1

in the vimrc file.  (This special highlighting only applies for tabs
inside search patterns, replacement texts, addresses or text included
by an Append/Change/Insert command.)  If you enable this option, it is
also a good idea to set the tab width to one character; by doing that,
you can easily count the number of tabs in a string.

Bugs:

  The transform command (y) is treated exactly like the substitute
  command.  This means that, as far as this syntax file is concerned,
  transform accepts the same flags as substitute, which is wrong.
  (Transform accepts no flags.)  I tolerate this bug because the
  involved commands need very complex treatment (95 patterns, one for
  each plausible pattern delimiter).


SGML						*sgml.vim* *ft-sgml-syntax*

The coloring scheme for tags in the SGML file works as follows.

The <> of opening tags are colored differently than the </> of a closing tag.
This is on purpose! For opening tags the 'Function' color is used, while for
closing tags the 'Type' color is used (See syntax.vim to check how those are
defined for you)

Known tag names are colored the same way as statements in C.  Unknown tag
names are not colored which makes it easy to spot errors.

Note that the same is true for argument (or attribute) names.  Known attribute
names are colored differently than unknown ones.

Some SGML tags are used to change the rendering of text.  The following tags
are recognized by the sgml.vim syntax coloring file and change the way normal
text is shown: <varname> <emphasis> <command> <function> <literal>
<replaceable> <ulink> and <link>.

If you want to change how such text is rendered, you must redefine the
following syntax groups:

    - sgmlBold
    - sgmlBoldItalic
    - sgmlUnderline
    - sgmlItalic
    - sgmlLink for links

To make this redefinition work you must redefine them all and define the
following variable in your vimrc (this is due to the order in which the files
are read during initialization) >
   let sgml_my_rendering=1

You can also disable this rendering by adding the following line to your
vimrc file: >
   let sgml_no_rendering=1

(Adapted from the html.vim help text by Claudio Fleiner <claudio@fleiner.com>)


SH		*sh.vim* *ft-sh-syntax* *ft-bash-syntax* *ft-ksh-syntax*

This covers the "normal" Unix (Bourne) sh, bash and the Korn shell.

Vim attempts to determine which shell type is in use by specifying that
various filenames are of specific types: >

    ksh : .kshrc* *.ksh
    bash: .bashrc* bashrc bash.bashrc .bash_profile* *.bash
<
If none of these cases pertain, then the first line of the file is examined
(ex. /bin/sh  /bin/ksh	/bin/bash).  If the first line specifies a shelltype,
then that shelltype is used.  However some files (ex. .profile) are known to
be shell files but the type is not apparent.  Furthermore, on many systems
sh is symbolically linked to "bash" (Linux, Windows+cygwin) or "ksh" (Posix).

One may specify a global default by instantiating one of the following three
variables in your <.vimrc>:

    ksh: >
	let g:is_kornshell = 1
<   posix: (using this is the same as setting is_kornshell to 1) >
	let g:is_posix     = 1
<   bash: >
	let g:is_bash	   = 1
<   sh: (default) Bourne shell >
	let g:is_sh	   = 1

If there's no "#! ..." line, and the user hasn't availed himself/herself of a
default sh.vim syntax setting as just shown, then syntax/sh.vim will assume
the Bourne shell syntax.  No need to quote RFCs or market penetration
statistics in error reports, please -- just select the default version of the
sh your system uses in your <.vimrc>.

The syntax/sh.vim file provides several levels of syntax-based folding: >

	let g:sh_fold_enabled= 0     (default, no syntax folding)
	let g:sh_fold_enabled= 1     (enable function folding)
	let g:sh_fold_enabled= 2     (enable heredoc folding)
	let g:sh_fold_enabled= 4     (enable if/do/for folding)
>
then various syntax items (HereDocuments and function bodies) become
syntax-foldable (see |:syn-fold|).  You also may add these together
to get multiple types of folding: >

	let g:sh_fold_enabled= 3     (enables function and heredoc folding)

If you notice highlighting errors while scrolling backwards which are fixed
when one redraws with CTRL-L, try setting the "sh_minlines" internal variable
to a larger number.  Example: >

	let sh_minlines = 500

This will make syntax synchronization start 500 lines before the first
displayed line.  The default value is 200.  The disadvantage of using a larger
number is that redrawing can become slow.

If you don't have much to synchronize on, displaying can be very slow.	To
reduce this, the "sh_maxlines" internal variable can be set.  Example: >

	let sh_maxlines = 100
<
The default is to use the twice sh_minlines.  Set it to a smaller number to
speed up displaying.  The disadvantage is that highlight errors may appear.

						*g:sh_isk* *g:sh_noisk*
The shell languages appear to let "." be part of words, commands, etc;
consequently it should be in the isk for sh.vim.  As of v116 of syntax/sh.vim,
syntax/sh.vim will append the "." to |'iskeyword'| by default; you may control
this behavior with: >
	let g:sh_isk  = '..whatever characters you want as part of iskeyword'
	let g:sh_noisk= 1  " otherwise, if this exists, the isk will NOT chg
<
						*sh-embed*  *sh-awk*
 Sh: EMBEDDING LANGUAGES~

You may wish to embed languages into sh.  I'll give an example courtesy of
Lorance Stinson on how to do this with awk as an example. Put the following
file into $HOME/.vim/after/syntax/sh/awkembed.vim: >

    " AWK Embedding: {{{1
    " ==============
    " Shamelessly ripped from aspperl.vim by Aaron Hope.
    if exists("b:current_syntax")

    hi def link AWKCommand Type
<
This code will then let the awk code in the single quotes: >
	awk '...awk code here...'
be highlighted using the awk highlighting syntax.  Clearly this may be
extended to other languages.


SPEEDUP						*spup.vim* *ft-spup-syntax*
(AspenTech plant simulator)

The Speedup syntax file has some options:

- strict_subsections : If this variable is defined, only keywords for
  sections and subsections will be highlighted as statements but not
  other keywords (like WITHIN in the OPERATION section).

- highlight_types : Definition of this variable causes stream types
  like temperature or pressure to be highlighted as Type, not as a
  plain Identifier.  Included are the types that are usually found in
  the DECLARE section; if you defined own types, you have to include
  them in the syntax file.

- oneline_comments : this value ranges from 1 to 3 and determines the
  highlighting of # style comments.

  oneline_comments = 1 : allow normal Speedup code after an even
  number of #s.

  oneline_comments = 2 : show code starting with the second # as
  error.  This is the default setting.

  oneline_comments = 3 : show the whole line as error if it contains
  more than one #.

Since especially OPERATION sections tend to become very large due to
PRESETting variables, syncing may be critical.  If your computer is
fast enough, you can increase minlines and/or maxlines near the end of
the syntax file.


SQL						*sql.vim* *ft-sql-syntax*
				*sqlinformix.vim* *ft-sqlinformix-syntax*
				*sqlanywhere.vim* *ft-sqlanywhere-syntax*

While there is an ANSI standard for SQL, most database engines add their own
custom extensions.  Vim currently supports the Oracle and Informix dialects of
SQL.  Vim assumes "*.sql" files are Oracle SQL by default.

Vim currently has SQL support for a variety of different vendors via syntax
scripts.  You can change Vim's default from Oracle to any of the current SQL
supported types.  You can also easily alter the SQL dialect being used on a
buffer by buffer basis.

For more detailed instructions see |ft_sql.txt|.


TCSH						*tcsh.vim* *ft-tcsh-syntax*

This covers the shell named "tcsh".  It is a superset of csh.  See |csh.vim|
for how the filetype is detected.

Tcsh does not allow \" in strings unless the "backslash_quote" shell variable
is set.  If you want VIM to assume that no backslash quote constructs exist add
this line to your .vimrc: >

	:let tcsh_backslash_quote = 0

If you notice highlighting errors while scrolling backwards, which are fixed
when redrawing with CTRL-L, try setting the "tcsh_minlines" internal variable
to a larger number: >

	:let tcsh_minlines = 1000

This will make the syntax synchronization start 1000 lines before the first
displayed line.  If you set "tcsh_minlines" to "fromstart", then
synchronization is done from the start of the file. The default value for
tcsh_minlines is 100.  The disadvantage of using a larger number is that
redrawing can become slow.

				*tex-folding* *g:tex_fold_enabled*
 Tex: Want Syntax Folding? ~

As of version 28 of <syntax/tex.vim>, syntax-based folding of parts, chapters,
sections, subsections, etc are supported.  Put >
	let g:tex_fold_enabled=1
in your <.vimrc>, and :set fdm=syntax.  I suggest doing the latter via a
modeline at the end of your LaTeX file: >
	% vim: fdm=syntax
If your system becomes too slow, then you might wish to look into >
	https://vimhelp.appspot.com/vim_faq.txt.html#faq-29.7
<
						*g:tex_nospell*
 Tex: No Spell Checking Wanted~

If you don't want spell checking anywhere in your LaTeX document, put >
	let g:tex_nospell=1
into your .vimrc.  If you merely wish to suppress spell checking inside
comments only, see |g:tex_comment_nospell|.

				*tex-nospell* *g:tex_comment_nospell*
 Tex: Don't Want Spell Checking In Comments? ~

Some folks like to include things like source code in comments and so would
prefer that spell checking be disabled in comments in LaTeX files.  To do
this, put the following in your <.vimrc>: >
      let g:tex_comment_nospell= 1
If you want to suppress spell checking everywhere inside your LaTeX document,
see |g:tex_nospell|.

				*tex-verb* *g:tex_verbspell*
 Tex: Want Spell Checking in Verbatim Zones?~

Often verbatim regions are used for things like source code; seldom does
one want source code spell-checked.  However, for those of you who do
want your verbatim zones spell-checked, put the following in your <.vimrc>: >
	let g:tex_verbspell= 1
<
					*tex-runon* *tex-stopzone*
 Tex: Run-on Comments or MathZones ~

The <syntax/tex.vim> highlighting supports TeX, LaTeX, and some AmsTeX.  The
highlighting supports three primary zones/regions: normal, texZone, and
texMathZone.  Although considerable effort has been made to have these zones
terminate properly, zones delineated by $..$ and $$..$$ cannot be synchronized
as there's no difference between start and end patterns.  Consequently, a
special "TeX comment" has been provided >
	%stopzone
which will forcibly terminate the highlighting of either a texZone or a
texMathZone.

					*tex-slow* *tex-sync*
 Tex: Slow Syntax Highlighting? ~

If you have a slow computer, you may wish to reduce the values for >
	:syn sync maxlines=200
	:syn sync minlines=50
(especially the latter).  If your computer is fast, you may wish to
increase them.	This primarily affects synchronizing (i.e. just what group,
if any, is the text at the top of the screen supposed to be in?).

Another cause of slow highlighting is due to syntax-driven folding; see
|tex-folding| for a way around this.

					*g:tex_fast*

Finally, if syntax highlighting is still too slow, you may set >

	:let g:tex_fast= ""

in your .vimrc.  Used this way, the g:tex_fast variable causes the syntax
highlighting script to avoid defining any regions and associated
synchronization.  The result will be much faster syntax highlighting; the
price: you will no longer have as much highlighting or any syntax-based
folding, and you will be missing syntax-based error checking.

You may decide that some syntax is acceptable; you may use the following table
selectively to enable just some syntax highlighting: >

    b : allow bold and italic syntax
    c : allow texComment syntax
    m : allow texMatcher syntax (ie. {...} and [...])
    M : allow texMath syntax
    p : allow parts, chapter, section, etc syntax
    r : allow texRefZone syntax (nocite, bibliography, label, pageref, eqref)
    s : allow superscript/subscript regions
    S : allow texStyle syntax
    v : allow verbatim syntax
    V : allow texNewEnv and texNewCmd syntax
<
As an example, let g:tex_fast= "M" will allow math-associated highlighting
but suppress all the other region-based syntax highlighting.
(also see: |g:tex_conceal| and |tex-supersub|)

					*tex-morecommands* *tex-package*
 Tex: Want To Highlight More Commands? ~

LaTeX is a programmable language, and so there are thousands of packages full
of specialized LaTeX commands, syntax, and fonts.  If you're using such a
package you'll often wish that the distributed syntax/tex.vim would support
it.  However, clearly this is impractical.  So please consider using the
techniques in |mysyntaxfile-add| to extend or modify the highlighting provided
by syntax/tex.vim.  Please consider uploading any extensions that you write,
which typically would go in $HOME/after/syntax/tex/[pkgname].vim, to
http://vim.sf.net/.

					*tex-error* *g:tex_no_error*
 Tex: Excessive Error Highlighting? ~

The <tex.vim> supports lexical error checking of various sorts.  Thus,
although the error checking is ofttimes very useful, it can indicate
errors where none actually are.  If this proves to be a problem for you,
you may put in your <.vimrc> the following statement: >
	let g:tex_no_error=1
and all error checking by <syntax/tex.vim> will be suppressed.

								*tex-math*
 Tex: Need a new Math Group? ~

If you want to include a new math group in your LaTeX, the following
code shows you an example as to how you might do so: >
	call TexNewMathZone(sfx,mathzone,starform)
You'll want to provide the new math group with a unique suffix
(currently, A-L and V-Z are taken by <syntax/tex.vim> itself).
As an example, consider how eqnarray is set up by <syntax/tex.vim>: >
	call TexNewMathZone("D","eqnarray",1)
You'll need to change "mathzone" to the name of your new math group,
and then to the call to it in .vim/after/syntax/tex.vim.
The "starform" variable, if true, implies that your new math group
has a starred form (ie. eqnarray*).

					*tex-style* *b:tex_stylish*
 Tex: Starting a New Style? ~

One may use "\makeatletter" in *.tex files, thereby making the use of "@" in
commands available.  However, since the *.tex file doesn't have one of the
following suffices: sty cls clo dtx ltx, the syntax highlighting will flag
such use of @ as an error.  To solve this: >

	:let b:tex_stylish = 1
	:set ft=tex

Putting "let g:tex_stylish=1" into your <.vimrc> will make <syntax/tex.vim>
always accept such use of @.

					*tex-cchar* *tex-cole* *tex-conceal*
 Tex: Taking Advantage of Conceal Mode~

If you have |'conceallevel'| set to 2 and if your encoding is utf-8, then a
number of character sequences can be translated into appropriate utf-8 glyphs,
including various accented characters, Greek characters in MathZones, and
superscripts and subscripts in MathZones.  Not all characters can be made into
superscripts or subscripts; the constraint is due to what utf-8 supports.
In fact, only a few characters are supported as subscripts.

One way to use this is to have vertically split windows (see |CTRL-W_v|); one
with |'conceallevel'| at 0 and the other at 2; and both using |'scrollbind'|.

					*g:tex_conceal*
 Tex: Selective Conceal Mode~

You may selectively use conceal mode by setting g:tex_conceal in your
<.vimrc>.  By default, g:tex_conceal is set to "admgs" to enable concealment
for the following sets of characters: >

	a = accents/ligatures
	b = bold and italic
	d = delimiters
	m = math symbols
	g = Greek
	s = superscripts/subscripts
<
By leaving one or more of these out, the associated conceal-character
substitution will not be made.

						*g:tex_isk* *g:tex_stylish*
 Tex: Controlling iskeyword~

Normally, LaTeX keywords support 0-9, a-z, A-z, and 192-255 only. Latex
keywords don't support the underscore - except when in *.sty files.  The
syntax highlighting script handles this with the following logic:

	* If g:tex_stylish exists and is 1
		then the file will be treated as a "sty" file, so the "_"
		will be allowed as part of keywords
		(irregardless of g:tex_isk)
	* Else if the file's suffix is sty, cls, clo, dtx, or ltx,
		then the file will be treated as a "sty" file, so the "_"
		will be allowed as part of keywords
		(irregardless of g:tex_isk)

	* If g:tex_isk exists, then it will be used for the local 'iskeyword'
	* Else the local 'iskeyword' will be set to 48-57,a-z,A-Z,192-255

			*tex-supersub* *g:tex_superscripts* *g:tex_subscripts*
 Tex: Fine Subscript and Superscript Control~

	See |tex-conceal| for how to enable concealed character replacement.

	See |g:tex_conceal| for selectively concealing accents, bold/italic,
	math, Greek, and superscripts/subscripts.

	One may exert fine control over which superscripts and subscripts one
	wants syntax-based concealment for (see |:syn-cchar|).  Since not all
	fonts support all characters, one may override the
	concealed-replacement lists; by default these lists are given by: >

	    let g:tex_superscripts= "[0-9a-zA-W.,:;+-<>/()=]"
	    let g:tex_subscripts= "[0-9aehijklmnoprstuvx,+-/().]"
<
	For example, I use Luxi Mono Bold; it doesn't support subscript
	characters for "hklmnpst", so I put >
		let g:tex_subscripts= "[0-9aeijoruvx,+-/().]"
<	in ~/.vim/ftplugin/tex/tex.vim in order to avoid having inscrutable
	utf-8 glyphs appear.


TF						*tf.vim* *ft-tf-syntax*

There is one option for the tf syntax highlighting.

For syncing, minlines defaults to 100.	If you prefer another value, you can
set "tf_minlines" to the value you desire.  Example: >

	:let tf_minlines = your choice
<
VIM			*vim.vim*		*ft-vim-syntax*
			*g:vimsyn_minlines*	*g:vimsyn_maxlines*
There is a trade-off between more accurate syntax highlighting versus screen
updating speed.  To improve accuracy, you may wish to increase the
g:vimsyn_minlines variable.  The g:vimsyn_maxlines variable may be used to
improve screen updating rates (see |:syn-sync| for more on this). >

	g:vimsyn_minlines : used to set synchronization minlines
	g:vimsyn_maxlines : used to set synchronization maxlines
<
	(g:vim_minlines and g:vim_maxlines are deprecated variants of
	these two options)

						*g:vimsyn_embed*
The g:vimsyn_embed option allows users to select what, if any, types of
embedded script highlighting they wish to have. >

   g:vimsyn_embed == 0   : don't embed any scripts
   g:vimsyn_embed =~ 'm' : support embedded mzscheme
   g:vimsyn_embed =~ 'p' : support embedded perl
   g:vimsyn_embed =~ 'P' : support embedded python
   g:vimsyn_embed =~ 'r' : support embedded ruby
   g:vimsyn_embed =~ 't' : support embedded tcl
<
By default, g:vimsyn_embed is a string supporting interpreters that your vim
itself supports.  Concatenate multiple characters to support multiple types
of embedded interpreters; ie. g:vimsyn_embed= "mp" supports embedded mzscheme
and embedded perl.
						*g:vimsyn_folding*

Some folding is now supported with syntax/vim.vim: >

   g:vimsyn_folding == 0 or doesn't exist: no syntax-based folding
   g:vimsyn_folding =~ 'a' : augroups
   g:vimsyn_folding =~ 'f' : fold functions
   g:vimsyn_folding =~ 'm' : fold mzscheme script
   g:vimsyn_folding =~ 'p' : fold perl     script
   g:vimsyn_folding =~ 'P' : fold python   script
   g:vimsyn_folding =~ 'r' : fold ruby     script
   g:vimsyn_folding =~ 't' : fold tcl      script
<
							*g:vimsyn_noerror*
Not all error highlighting that syntax/vim.vim does may be correct; VimL is a
difficult language to highlight correctly.  A way to suppress error
highlighting is to put the following line in your |vimrc|: >

	let g:vimsyn_noerror = 1
<


XF86CONFIG				*xf86conf.vim* *ft-xf86conf-syntax*

The syntax of XF86Config file differs in XFree86 v3.x and v4.x.  Both
variants are supported.  Automatic detection is used, but is far from perfect.
You may need to specify the version manually.  Set the variable
xf86conf_xfree86_version to 3 or 4 according to your XFree86 version in
your .vimrc.  Example: >
	:let xf86conf_xfree86_version=3
When using a mix of versions, set the b:xf86conf_xfree86_version variable.

Note that spaces and underscores in option names are not supported.  Use
"SyncOnGreen" instead of "__s yn con gr_e_e_n" if you want the option name
highlighted.


XML						*xml.vim* *ft-xml-syntax*

Xml namespaces are highlighted by default.  This can be inhibited by
setting a global variable: >

	:let g:xml_namespace_transparent=1
<
							*xml-folding*
The xml syntax file provides syntax |folding| (see |:syn-fold|) between
start and end tags.  This can be turned on by >

	:let g:xml_syntax_folding = 1
	:set foldmethod=syntax

Note: syntax folding might slow down syntax highlighting significantly,
especially for large files.


X Pixmaps (XPM)					*xpm.vim* *ft-xpm-syntax*

xpm.vim creates its syntax items dynamically based upon the contents of the
XPM file.  Thus if you make changes e.g. in the color specification strings,
you have to source it again e.g. with ":set syn=xpm".

To copy a pixel with one of the colors, yank a "pixel" with "yl" and insert it
somewhere else with "P".

Do you want to draw with the mouse?  Try the following: >
   :function! GetPixel()
   :   let c = getline(".")[col(".") - 1]
   :   echo c
   :   exe "noremap <LeftMouse> <LeftMouse>r".c
   :   exe "noremap <LeftDrag>	<LeftMouse>r".c
   :endfunction
   :noremap <RightMouse> <LeftMouse>:call GetPixel()<CR>
   :set guicursor=n:hor20	   " to see the color beneath the cursor
This turns the right button into a pipette and the left button into a pen.
It will work with XPM files that have one character per pixel only and you
must not click outside of the pixel strings, but feel free to improve it.

It will look much better with a font in a quadratic cell size, e.g. for X: >
	:set guifont=-*-clean-medium-r-*-*-8-*-*-*-*-80-*

==============================================================================
5. Defining a syntax					*:syn-define* *E410*

Vim understands three types of syntax items:

1. Keyword
   It can only contain keyword characters, according to the 'iskeyword'
   option.  It cannot contain other syntax items.  It will only match with a
   complete word (there are no keyword characters before or after the match).
   The keyword "if" would match in "if(a=b)", but not in "ifdef x", because
   "(" is not a keyword character and "d" is.

2. Match
   This is a match with a single regexp pattern.

3. Region
   This starts at a match of the "start" regexp pattern and ends with a match
   with the "end" regexp pattern.  Any other text can appear in between.  A
   "skip" regexp pattern can be used to avoid matching the "end" pattern.

Several syntax ITEMs can be put into one syntax GROUP.	For a syntax group
you can give highlighting attributes.  For example, you could have an item
to define a "/* .. */" comment and another one that defines a "// .." comment,
and put them both in the "Comment" group.  You can then specify that a
"Comment" will be in bold font and have a blue color.  You are free to make
one highlight group for one syntax item, or put all items into one group.
This depends on how you want to specify your highlighting attributes.  Putting
each item in its own group results in having to specify the highlighting
for a lot of groups.

Note that a syntax group and a highlight group are similar.  For a highlight
group you will have given highlight attributes.  These attributes will be used
for the syntax group with the same name.

In case more than one item matches at the same position, the one that was
defined LAST wins.  Thus you can override previously defined syntax items by
using an item that matches the same text.  But a keyword always goes before a
match or region.  And a keyword with matching case always goes before a
keyword with ignoring case.


PRIORITY						*:syn-priority*

When several syntax items may match, these rules are used:

1. When multiple Match or Region items start in the same position, the item
   defined last has priority.
2. A Keyword has priority over Match and Region items.
3. An item that starts in an earlier position has priority over items that
   start in later positions.


DEFINING CASE						*:syn-case* *E390*

:sy[ntax] case [match | ignore]
	This defines if the following ":syntax" commands will work with
	matching case, when using "match", or with ignoring case, when using
	"ignore".  Note that any items before this are not affected, and all
	items until the next ":syntax case" command are affected.


SPELL CHECKING						*:syn-spell*

:sy[ntax] spell [toplevel | notoplevel | default]
	This defines where spell checking is to be done for text that is not
	in a syntax item:

	toplevel:	Text is spell checked.
	notoplevel:	Text is not spell checked.
	default:	When there is a @Spell cluster no spell checking.

	For text in syntax items use the @Spell and @NoSpell clusters
	|spell-syntax|.  When there is no @Spell and no @NoSpell cluster then
	spell checking is done for "default" and "toplevel".

	To activate spell checking the 'spell' option must be set.


DEFINING KEYWORDS					*:syn-keyword*

:sy[ntax] keyword {group-name} [{options}] {keyword} .. [{options}]

	This defines a number of keywords.

	{group-name}	Is a syntax group name such as "Comment".
	[{options}]	See |:syn-arguments| below.
	{keyword} ..	Is a list of keywords which are part of this group.

	Example: >
  :syntax keyword   Type   int long char
<
	The {options} can be given anywhere in the line.  They will apply to
	all keywords given, also for options that come after a keyword.
	These examples do exactly the same: >
  :syntax keyword   Type   contained int long char
  :syntax keyword   Type   int long contained char
  :syntax keyword   Type   int long char contained
<								*E789*
	When you have a keyword with an optional tail, like Ex commands in
	Vim, you can put the optional characters inside [], to define all the
	variations at once: >
  :syntax keyword   vimCommand	 ab[breviate] n[ext]
<
	Don't forget that a keyword can only be recognized if all the
	characters are included in the 'iskeyword' option.  If one character
	isn't, the keyword will never be recognized.
	Multi-byte characters can also be used.  These do not have to be in
	'iskeyword'.

	A keyword always has higher priority than a match or region, the
	keyword is used if more than one item matches.	Keywords do not nest
	and a keyword can't contain anything else.

	Note that when you have a keyword that is the same as an option (even
	one that isn't allowed here), you can not use it.  Use a match
	instead.

	The maximum length of a keyword is 80 characters.

	The same keyword can be defined multiple times, when its containment
	differs.  For example, you can define the keyword once not contained
	and use one highlight group, and once contained, and use a different
	highlight group.  Example: >
  :syn keyword vimCommand tag
  :syn keyword vimSetting contained tag
<	When finding "tag" outside of any syntax item, the "vimCommand"
	highlight group is used.  When finding "tag" in a syntax item that
	contains "vimSetting", the "vimSetting" group is used.


DEFINING MATCHES					*:syn-match*

:sy[ntax] match {group-name} [{options}] [excludenl] {pattern} [{options}]

	This defines one match.

	{group-name}		A syntax group name such as "Comment".
	[{options}]		See |:syn-arguments| below.
	[excludenl]		Don't make a pattern with the end-of-line "$"
				extend a containing match or region.  Must be
				given before the pattern. |:syn-excludenl|
	{pattern}		The search pattern that defines the match.
				See |:syn-pattern| below.
				Note that the pattern may match more than one
				line, which makes the match depend on where
				Vim starts searching for the pattern.  You
				need to make sure syncing takes care of this.

	Example (match a character constant): >
  :syntax match Character /'.'/hs=s+1,he=e-1
<

DEFINING REGIONS	*:syn-region* *:syn-start* *:syn-skip* *:syn-end*
							*E398* *E399*
:sy[ntax] region {group-name} [{options}]
		[matchgroup={group-name}]
		[keepend]
		[extend]
		[excludenl]
		start={start_pattern} ..
		[skip={skip_pattern}]
		end={end_pattern} ..
		[{options}]

	This defines one region.  It may span several lines.

	{group-name}		A syntax group name such as "Comment".
	[{options}]		See |:syn-arguments| below.
	[matchgroup={group-name}]  The syntax group to use for the following
				start or end pattern matches only.  Not used
				for the text in between the matched start and
				end patterns.  Use NONE to reset to not using
				a different group for the start or end match.
				See |:syn-matchgroup|.
	keepend			Don't allow contained matches to go past a
				match with the end pattern.  See
				|:syn-keepend|.
	extend			Override a "keepend" for an item this region
				is contained in.  See |:syn-extend|.
	excludenl		Don't make a pattern with the end-of-line "$"
				extend a containing match or item.  Only
				useful for end patterns.  Must be given before
				the patterns it applies to. |:syn-excludenl|
	start={start_pattern}	The search pattern that defines the start of
				the region.  See |:syn-pattern| below.
	skip={skip_pattern}	The search pattern that defines text inside
				the region where not to look for the end
				pattern.  See |:syn-pattern| below.
	end={end_pattern}	The search pattern that defines the end of
				the region.  See |:syn-pattern| below.

	Example: >
  :syntax region String   start=+"+  skip=+\\"+  end=+"+
<
	The start/skip/end patterns and the options can be given in any order.
	There can be zero or one skip pattern.	There must be one or more
	start and end patterns.  This means that you can omit the skip
	pattern, but you must give at least one start and one end pattern.  It
	is allowed to have white space before and after the equal sign
	(although it mostly looks better without white space).

	When more than one start pattern is given, a match with one of these
	is sufficient.	This means there is an OR relation between the start
	patterns.  The last one that matches is used.  The same is true for
	the end patterns.

	The search for the end pattern starts right after the start pattern.
	Offsets are not used for this.	This implies that the match for the
	end pattern will never overlap with the start pattern.

	The skip and end pattern can match across line breaks, but since the
	search for the pattern can start in any line it often does not do what
	you want.  The skip pattern doesn't avoid a match of an end pattern in
	the next line.	Use single-line patterns to avoid trouble.

	Note: The decision to start a region is only based on a matching start
	pattern.  There is no check for a matching end pattern.  This does NOT
	work: >
		:syn region First  start="("  end=":"
		:syn region Second start="("  end=";"
<	The Second always matches before the First (last defined pattern has
	higher priority).  The Second region then continues until the next
	';', no matter if there is a ':' before it.  Using a match does work: >
		:syn match First  "(\_.\{-}:"
		:syn match Second "(\_.\{-};"
<	This pattern matches any character or line break with "\_." and
	repeats that with "\{-}" (repeat as few as possible).

							*:syn-keepend*
	By default, a contained match can obscure a match for the end pattern.
	This is useful for nesting.  For example, a region that starts with
	"{" and ends with "}", can contain another region.  An encountered "}"
	will then end the contained region, but not the outer region:
	    {		starts outer "{}" region
		{	starts contained "{}" region
		}	ends contained "{}" region
	    }		ends outer "{} region
	If you don't want this, the "keepend" argument will make the matching
	of an end pattern of the outer region also end any contained item.
	This makes it impossible to nest the same region, but allows for
	contained items to highlight parts of the end pattern, without causing
	that to skip the match with the end pattern.  Example: >
  :syn match  vimComment +"[^"]\+$+
  :syn region vimCommand start="set" end="$" contains=vimComment keepend
<	The "keepend" makes the vimCommand always end at the end of the line,
	even though the contained vimComment includes a match with the <EOL>.

	When "keepend" is not used, a match with an end pattern is retried
	after each contained match.  When "keepend" is included, the first
	encountered match with an end pattern is used, truncating any
	contained matches.
							*:syn-extend*
	The "keepend" behavior can be changed by using the "extend" argument.
	When an item with "extend" is contained in an item that uses
	"keepend", the "keepend" is ignored and the containing region will be
	extended.
	This can be used to have some contained items extend a region while
	others don't.  Example: >

   :syn region htmlRef start=+<a>+ end=+</a>+ keepend contains=htmlItem,htmlScript
   :syn match htmlItem +<[^>]*>+ contained
   :syn region htmlScript start=+<script+ end=+</script[^>]*>+ contained extend

<	Here the htmlItem item does not make the htmlRef item continue
	further, it is only used to highlight the <> items.  The htmlScript
	item does extend the htmlRef item.

	Another example: >
   :syn region xmlFold start="<a>" end="</a>" fold transparent keepend extend
<	This defines a region with "keepend", so that its end cannot be
	changed by contained items, like when the "</a>" is matched to
	highlight it differently.  But when the xmlFold region is nested (it
	includes itself), the "extend" applies, so that the "</a>" of a nested
	region only ends that region, and not the one it is contained in.

							*:syn-excludenl*
	When a pattern for a match or end pattern of a region includes a '$'
	to match the end-of-line, it will make a region item that it is
	contained in continue on the next line.  For example, a match with
	"\\$" (backslash at the end of the line) can make a region continue
	that would normally stop at the end of the line.  This is the default
	behavior.  If this is not wanted, there are two ways to avoid it:
	1. Use "keepend" for the containing item.  This will keep all
	   contained matches from extending the match or region.  It can be
	   used when all contained items must not extend the containing item.
	2. Use "excludenl" in the contained item.  This will keep that match
	   from extending the containing match or region.  It can be used if
	   only some contained items must not extend the containing item.
	   "excludenl" must be given before the pattern it applies to.

							*:syn-matchgroup*
	"matchgroup" can be used to highlight the start and/or end pattern
	differently than the body of the region.  Example: >
  :syntax region String matchgroup=Quote start=+"+  skip=+\\"+	end=+"+
<	This will highlight the quotes with the "Quote" group, and the text in
	between with the "String" group.
	The "matchgroup" is used for all start and end patterns that follow,
	until the next "matchgroup".  Use "matchgroup=NONE" to go back to not
	using a matchgroup.

	In a start or end pattern that is highlighted with "matchgroup" the
	contained items of the region are not used.  This can be used to avoid
	that a contained item matches in the start or end pattern match.  When
	using "transparent", this does not apply to a start or end pattern
	match that is highlighted with "matchgroup".

	Here is an example, which highlights three levels of parentheses in
	different colors: >
   :sy region par1 matchgroup=par1 start=/(/ end=/)/ contains=par2
   :sy region par2 matchgroup=par2 start=/(/ end=/)/ contains=par3 contained
   :sy region par3 matchgroup=par3 start=/(/ end=/)/ contains=par1 contained
   :hi par1 ctermfg=red guifg=red
   :hi par2 ctermfg=blue guifg=blue
   :hi par3 ctermfg=darkgreen guifg=darkgreen
<
						*E849*
The maximum number of syntax groups is 19999.

==============================================================================
6. :syntax arguments					*:syn-arguments*

The :syntax commands that define syntax items take a number of arguments.
The common ones are explained here.  The arguments may be given in any order
and may be mixed with patterns.

Not all commands accept all arguments.	This table shows which arguments
can not be used for all commands:
							*E395*
		    contains  oneline	fold  display  extend concealends~
:syntax keyword		 -	 -	 -	 -	 -      -
:syntax match		yes	 -	yes	yes	yes     -
:syntax region		yes	yes	yes	yes	yes    yes

These arguments can be used for all three commands:
	conceal
	cchar
	contained
	containedin
	nextgroup
	transparent
	skipwhite
	skipnl
	skipempty

conceal						*conceal* *:syn-conceal*

When the "conceal" argument is given, the item is marked as concealable.
Whether or not it is actually concealed depends on the value of the
'conceallevel' option.  The 'concealcursor' option is used to decide whether
concealable items in the current line are displayed unconcealed to be able to
edit the line.

concealends						*:syn-concealends*

When the "concealends" argument is given, the start and end matches of
the region, but not the contents of the region, are marked as concealable.
Whether or not they are actually concealed depends on the setting on the
'conceallevel' option. The ends of a region can only be concealed separately
in this way when they have their own highlighting via "matchgroup"

cchar							*:syn-cchar*
							*E844*
The "cchar" argument defines the character shown in place of the item
when it is concealed (setting "cchar" only makes sense when the conceal
argument is given.) If "cchar" is not set then the default conceal
character defined in the 'listchars' option is used.  The character cannot be
a control character such as Tab.  Example: >
   :syntax match Entity "&amp;" conceal cchar=&
See |hl-Conceal| for highlighting.

contained						*:syn-contained*

When the "contained" argument is given, this item will not be recognized at
the top level, but only when it is mentioned in the "contains" field of
another match.	Example: >
   :syntax keyword Todo    TODO    contained
   :syntax match   Comment "//.*"  contains=Todo


display							*:syn-display*

If the "display" argument is given, this item will be skipped when the
detected highlighting will not be displayed.  This will speed up highlighting,
by skipping this item when only finding the syntax state for the text that is
to be displayed.

Generally, you can use "display" for match and region items that meet these
conditions:
- The item does not continue past the end of a line.  Example for C: A region
  for a "/*" comment can't contain "display", because it continues on the next
  line.
- The item does not contain items that continue past the end of the line or
  make it continue on the next line.
- The item does not change the size of any item it is contained in.  Example
  for C: A match with "\\$" in a preprocessor match can't have "display",
  because it may make that preprocessor match shorter.
- The item does not allow other items to match that didn't match otherwise,
  and that item may extend the match too far.  Example for C: A match for a
  "//" comment can't use "display", because a "/*" inside that comment would
  match then and start a comment which extends past the end of the line.

Examples, for the C language, where "display" can be used:
- match with a number
- match with a label


transparent						*:syn-transparent*

If the "transparent" argument is given, this item will not be highlighted
itself, but will take the highlighting of the item it is contained in.	This
is useful for syntax items that don't need any highlighting but are used
only to skip over a part of the text.

The "contains=" argument is also inherited from the item it is contained in,
unless a "contains" argument is given for the transparent item itself.	To
avoid that unwanted items are contained, use "contains=NONE".  Example, which
highlights words in strings, but makes an exception for "vim": >
	:syn match myString /'[^']*'/ contains=myWord,myVim
	:syn match myWord   /\<[a-z]*\>/ contained
	:syn match myVim    /\<vim\>/ transparent contained contains=NONE
	:hi link myString String
	:hi link myWord   Comment
Since the "myVim" match comes after "myWord" it is the preferred match (last
match in the same position overrules an earlier one).  The "transparent"
argument makes the "myVim" match use the same highlighting as "myString".  But
it does not contain anything.  If the "contains=NONE" argument would be left
out, then "myVim" would use the contains argument from myString and allow
"myWord" to be contained, which will be highlighted as a Constant.  This
happens because a contained match doesn't match inside itself in the same
position, thus the "myVim" match doesn't overrule the "myWord" match here.

When you look at the colored text, it is like looking at layers of contained
items.	The contained item is on top of the item it is contained in, thus you
see the contained item.  When a contained item is transparent, you can look
through, thus you see the item it is contained in.  In a picture:

		look from here

	    |	|   |	|   |	|
	    V	V   V	V   V	V

	       xxxx	  yyy		more contained items
	    ....................	contained item (transparent)
	=============================	first item

The 'x', 'y' and '=' represent a highlighted syntax item.  The '.' represent a
transparent group.

What you see is:

	=======xxxx=======yyy========

Thus you look through the transparent "....".


oneline							*:syn-oneline*

The "oneline" argument indicates that the region does not cross a line
boundary.  It must match completely in the current line.  However, when the
region has a contained item that does cross a line boundary, it continues on
the next line anyway.  A contained item can be used to recognize a line
continuation pattern.  But the "end" pattern must still match in the first
line, otherwise the region doesn't even start.

When the start pattern includes a "\n" to match an end-of-line, the end
pattern must be found in the same line as where the start pattern ends.  The
end pattern may also include an end-of-line.  Thus the "oneline" argument
means that the end of the start pattern and the start of the end pattern must
be within one line.  This can't be changed by a skip pattern that matches a
line break.


fold							*:syn-fold*

The "fold" argument makes the fold level increase by one for this item.
Example: >
   :syn region myFold start="{" end="}" transparent fold
   :syn sync fromstart
   :set foldmethod=syntax
This will make each {} block form one fold.

The fold will start on the line where the item starts, and end where the item
ends.  If the start and end are within the same line, there is no fold.
The 'foldnestmax' option limits the nesting of syntax folds.
{not available when Vim was compiled without |+folding| feature}


			*:syn-contains* *E405* *E406* *E407* *E408* *E409*
contains={group-name},..

The "contains" argument is followed by a list of syntax group names.  These
groups will be allowed to begin inside the item (they may extend past the
containing group's end).  This allows for recursive nesting of matches and
regions.  If there is no "contains" argument, no groups will be contained in
this item.  The group names do not need to be defined before they can be used
here.

contains=ALL
		If the only item in the contains list is "ALL", then all
		groups will be accepted inside the item.

contains=ALLBUT,{group-name},..
		If the first item in the contains list is "ALLBUT", then all
		groups will be accepted inside the item, except the ones that
		are listed.  Example: >
  :syntax region Block start="{" end="}" ... contains=ALLBUT,Function

contains=TOP
		If the first item in the contains list is "TOP", then all
		groups will be accepted that don't have the "contained"
		argument.
contains=TOP,{group-name},..
		Like "TOP", but excluding the groups that are listed.

contains=CONTAINED
		If the first item in the contains list is "CONTAINED", then
		all groups will be accepted that have the "contained"
		argument.
contains=CONTAINED,{group-name},..
		Like "CONTAINED", but excluding the groups that are
		listed.


The {group-name} in the "contains" list can be a pattern.  All group names
that match the pattern will be included (or excluded, if "ALLBUT" is used).
The pattern cannot contain white space or a ','.  Example: >
   ... contains=Comment.*,Keyw[0-3]
The matching will be done at moment the syntax command is executed.  Groups
that are defined later will not be matched.  Also, if the current syntax
command defines a new group, it is not matched.  Be careful: When putting
syntax commands in a file you can't rely on groups NOT being defined, because
the file may have been sourced before, and ":syn clear" doesn't remove the
group names.

The contained groups will also match in the start and end patterns of a
region.  If this is not wanted, the "matchgroup" argument can be used
|:syn-matchgroup|.  The "ms=" and "me=" offsets can be used to change the
region where contained items do match.	Note that this may also limit the
area that is highlighted


containedin={group-name}...				*:syn-containedin*

The "containedin" argument is followed by a list of syntax group names.  The
item will be allowed to begin inside these groups.  This works as if the
containing item has a "contains=" argument that includes this item.

The {group-name}... can be used just like for "contains", as explained above.

This is useful when adding a syntax item afterwards.  An item can be told to
be included inside an already existing item, without changing the definition
of that item.  For example, to highlight a word in a C comment after loading
the C syntax: >
	:syn keyword myword HELP containedin=cComment contained
Note that "contained" is also used, to avoid that the item matches at the top
level.

Matches for "containedin" are added to the other places where the item can
appear.  A "contains" argument may also be added as usual.  Don't forget that
keywords never contain another item, thus adding them to "containedin" won't
work.


nextgroup={group-name},..				*:syn-nextgroup*

The "nextgroup" argument is followed by a list of syntax group names,
separated by commas (just like with "contains", so you can also use patterns).

If the "nextgroup" argument is given, the mentioned syntax groups will be
tried for a match, after the match or region ends.  If none of the groups have
a match, highlighting continues normally.  If there is a match, this group
will be used, even when it is not mentioned in the "contains" field of the
current group.	This is like giving the mentioned group priority over all
other groups.  Example: >
   :syntax match  ccFoobar  "Foo.\{-}Bar"  contains=ccFoo
   :syntax match  ccFoo     "Foo"	    contained nextgroup=ccFiller
   :syntax region ccFiller  start="."  matchgroup=ccBar  end="Bar"  contained

This will highlight "Foo" and "Bar" differently, and only when there is a
"Bar" after "Foo".  In the text line below, "f" shows where ccFoo is used for
highlighting, and "bbb" where ccBar is used. >

   Foo asdfasd Bar asdf Foo asdf Bar asdf
   fff	       bbb	fff	 bbb

Note the use of ".\{-}" to skip as little as possible until the next Bar.
when ".*" would be used, the "asdf" in between "Bar" and "Foo" would be
highlighted according to the "ccFoobar" group, because the ccFooBar match
would include the first "Foo" and the last "Bar" in the line (see |pattern|).


skipwhite						*:syn-skipwhite*
skipnl							*:syn-skipnl*
skipempty						*:syn-skipempty*

These arguments are only used in combination with "nextgroup".	They can be
used to allow the next group to match after skipping some text:
	skipwhite	skip over space and tab characters
	skipnl		skip over the end of a line
	skipempty	skip over empty lines (implies a "skipnl")

When "skipwhite" is present, the white space is only skipped if there is no
next group that matches the white space.

When "skipnl" is present, the match with nextgroup may be found in the next
line.  This only happens when the current item ends at the end of the current
line!  When "skipnl" is not present, the nextgroup will only be found after
the current item in the same line.

When skipping text while looking for a next group, the matches for other
groups are ignored.  Only when no next group matches, other items are tried
for a match again.  This means that matching a next group and skipping white
space and <EOL>s has a higher priority than other items.

Example: >
  :syn match ifstart "\<if.*"	  nextgroup=ifline skipwhite skipempty
  :syn match ifline  "[^ \t].*" nextgroup=ifline skipwhite skipempty contained
  :syn match ifline  "endif"	contained
Note that the "[^ \t].*" match matches all non-white text.  Thus it would also
match "endif".	Therefore the "endif" match is put last, so that it takes
precedence.
Note that this example doesn't work for nested "if"s.  You need to add
"contains" arguments to make that work (omitted for simplicity of the
example).

IMPLICIT CONCEAL					*:syn-conceal-implicit*

:sy[ntax] conceal [on|off]
	This defines if the following ":syntax" commands will define keywords,
	matches or regions with the "conceal" flag set. After ":syn conceal
	on", all subsequent ":syn keyword", ":syn match" or ":syn region"
	defined will have the "conceal" flag set implicitly. ":syn conceal
	off" returns to the normal state where the "conceal" flag must be
	given explicitly.

==============================================================================
7. Syntax patterns				*:syn-pattern* *E401* *E402*

In the syntax commands, a pattern must be surrounded by two identical
characters.  This is like it works for the ":s" command.  The most common to
use is the double quote.  But if the pattern contains a double quote, you can
use another character that is not used in the pattern.	Examples: >
  :syntax region Comment  start="/\*"  end="\*/"
  :syntax region String   start=+"+    end=+"+	 skip=+\\"+

See |pattern| for the explanation of what a pattern is.  Syntax patterns are
always interpreted like the 'magic' option is set, no matter what the actual
value of 'magic' is.  And the patterns are interpreted like the 'l' flag is
not included in 'cpoptions'.  This was done to make syntax files portable and
independent of 'compatible' and 'magic' settings.

Try to avoid patterns that can match an empty string, such as "[a-z]*".
This slows down the highlighting a lot, because it matches everywhere.

						*:syn-pattern-offset*
The pattern can be followed by a character offset.  This can be used to
change the highlighted part, and to change the text area included in the
match or region (which only matters when trying to match other items).	Both
are relative to the matched pattern.  The character offset for a skip
pattern can be used to tell where to continue looking for an end pattern.

The offset takes the form of "{what}={offset}"
The {what} can be one of seven strings:

ms	Match Start	offset for the start of the matched text
me	Match End	offset for the end of the matched text
hs	Highlight Start	offset for where the highlighting starts
he	Highlight End	offset for where the highlighting ends
rs	Region Start	offset for where the body of a region starts
re	Region End	offset for where the body of a region ends
lc	Leading Context	offset past "leading context" of pattern

The {offset} can be:

s	start of the matched pattern
s+{nr}	start of the matched pattern plus {nr} chars to the right
s-{nr}	start of the matched pattern plus {nr} chars to the left
e	end of the matched pattern
e+{nr}	end of the matched pattern plus {nr} chars to the right
e-{nr}	end of the matched pattern plus {nr} chars to the left
{nr}	(for "lc" only): start matching {nr} chars right of the start

Examples: "ms=s+1", "hs=e-2", "lc=3".

Although all offsets are accepted after any pattern, they are not always
meaningful.  This table shows which offsets are actually used:

		    ms	 me   hs   he	rs   re	  lc ~
match item	    yes  yes  yes  yes	-    -	  yes
region item start   yes  -    yes  -	yes  -	  yes
region item skip    -	 yes  -    -	-    -	  yes
region item end     -	 yes  -    yes	-    yes  yes

Offsets can be concatenated, with a ',' in between.  Example: >
  :syn match String  /"[^"]*"/hs=s+1,he=e-1
<
    some "string" text
	  ^^^^^^		highlighted

Notes:
- There must be no white space between the pattern and the character
  offset(s).
- The highlighted area will never be outside of the matched text.
- A negative offset for an end pattern may not always work, because the end
  pattern may be detected when the highlighting should already have stopped.
- Before Vim 7.2 the offsets were counted in bytes instead of characters.
  This didn't work well for multi-byte characters, so it was changed with the
  Vim 7.2 release.
- The start of a match cannot be in a line other than where the pattern
  matched.  This doesn't work: "a\nb"ms=e.  You can make the highlighting
  start in another line, this does work: "a\nb"hs=e.

Example (match a comment but don't highlight the /* and */): >
  :syntax region Comment start="/\*"hs=e+1 end="\*/"he=s-1
<
	/* this is a comment */
	  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^	  highlighted

A more complicated Example: >
  :syn region Exa matchgroup=Foo start="foo"hs=s+2,rs=e+2 matchgroup=Bar end="bar"me=e-1,he=e-1,re=s-1
<
	 abcfoostringbarabc
	    mmmmmmmmmmm	    match
	      sssrrreee	    highlight start/region/end ("Foo", "Exa" and "Bar")

Leading context			*:syn-lc* *:syn-leading* *:syn-context*

Note: This is an obsolete feature, only included for backwards compatibility
with previous Vim versions.  It's now recommended to use the |/\@<=| construct
in the pattern.

The "lc" offset specifies leading context -- a part of the pattern that must
be present, but is not considered part of the match.  An offset of "lc=n" will
cause Vim to step back n columns before attempting the pattern match, allowing
characters which have already been matched in previous patterns to also be
used as leading context for this match.  This can be used, for instance, to
specify that an "escaping" character must not precede the match: >

  :syn match ZNoBackslash "[^\\]z"ms=s+1
  :syn match WNoBackslash "[^\\]w"lc=1
  :syn match Underline "_\+"
<
	  ___zzzz ___wwww
	  ^^^	  ^^^	  matches Underline
	      ^ ^	  matches ZNoBackslash
		     ^^^^ matches WNoBackslash

The "ms" offset is automatically set to the same value as the "lc" offset,
unless you set "ms" explicitly.


Multi-line patterns					*:syn-multi-line*

The patterns can include "\n" to match an end-of-line.	Mostly this works as
expected, but there are a few exceptions.

When using a start pattern with an offset, the start of the match is not
allowed to start in a following line.  The highlighting can start in a
following line though.  Using the "\zs" item also requires that the start of
the match doesn't move to another line.

The skip pattern can include the "\n", but the search for an end pattern will
continue in the first character of the next line, also when that character is
matched by the skip pattern.  This is because redrawing may start in any line
halfway a region and there is no check if the skip pattern started in a
previous line.	For example, if the skip pattern is "a\nb" and an end pattern
is "b", the end pattern does match in the second line of this: >
	 x x a
	 b x x
Generally this means that the skip pattern should not match any characters
after the "\n".


External matches					*:syn-ext-match*

These extra regular expression items are available in region patterns:

					*/\z(* */\z(\)* *E50* *E52* *E879*
    \z(\)	Marks the sub-expression as "external", meaning that it can be
		accessed from another pattern match.  Currently only usable in
		defining a syntax region start pattern.

					*/\z1* */\z2* */\z3* */\z4* */\z5*
    \z1  ...  \z9			*/\z6* */\z7* */\z8* */\z9* *E66* *E67*
		Matches the same string that was matched by the corresponding
		sub-expression in a previous start pattern match.

Sometimes the start and end patterns of a region need to share a common
sub-expression.  A common example is the "here" document in Perl and many Unix
shells.  This effect can be achieved with the "\z" special regular expression
items, which marks a sub-expression as "external", in the sense that it can be
referenced from outside the pattern in which it is defined.  The here-document
example, for instance, can be done like this: >
  :syn region hereDoc start="<<\z(\I\i*\)" end="^\z1$"

As can be seen here, the \z actually does double duty.	In the start pattern,
it marks the "\(\I\i*\)" sub-expression as external; in the end pattern, it
changes the \1 back-reference into an external reference referring to the
first external sub-expression in the start pattern.  External references can
also be used in skip patterns: >
  :syn region foo start="start \(\I\i*\)" skip="not end \z1" end="end \z1"

Note that normal and external sub-expressions are completely orthogonal and
indexed separately; for instance, if the pattern "\z(..\)\(..\)" is applied
to the string "aabb", then \1 will refer to "bb" and \z1 will refer to "aa".
Note also that external sub-expressions cannot be accessed as back-references
within the same pattern like normal sub-expressions.  If you want to use one
sub-expression as both a normal and an external sub-expression, you can nest
the two, as in "\(\z(...\)\)".

Note that only matches within a single line can be used.  Multi-line matches
cannot be referred to.

==============================================================================
8. Syntax clusters					*:syn-cluster* *E400*

:sy[ntax] cluster {cluster-name} [contains={group-name}..]
				 [add={group-name}..]
				 [remove={group-name}..]

This command allows you to cluster a list of syntax groups together under a
single name.

	contains={group-name}..
		The cluster is set to the specified list of groups.
	add={group-name}..
		The specified groups are added to the cluster.
	remove={group-name}..
		The specified groups are removed from the cluster.

A cluster so defined may be referred to in a contains=.., containedin=..,
nextgroup=.., add=..  or remove=.. list with a "@" prefix.  You can also use
this notation to implicitly declare a cluster before specifying its contents.

Example: >
   :syntax match Thing "# [^#]\+ #" contains=@ThingMembers
   :syntax cluster ThingMembers contains=ThingMember1,ThingMember2

As the previous example suggests, modifications to a cluster are effectively
retroactive; the membership of the cluster is checked at the last minute, so
to speak: >
   :syntax keyword A aaa
   :syntax keyword B bbb
   :syntax cluster AandB contains=A
   :syntax match Stuff "( aaa bbb )" contains=@AandB
   :syntax cluster AandB add=B	  " now both keywords are matched in Stuff

This also has implications for nested clusters: >
   :syntax keyword A aaa
   :syntax keyword B bbb
   :syntax cluster SmallGroup contains=B
   :syntax cluster BigGroup contains=A,@SmallGroup
   :syntax match Stuff "( aaa bbb )" contains=@BigGroup
   :syntax cluster BigGroup remove=B	" no effect, since B isn't in BigGroup
   :syntax cluster SmallGroup remove=B	" now bbb isn't matched within Stuff
<
						*E848*
The maximum number of clusters is 9767.

==============================================================================
9. Including syntax files				*:syn-include* *E397*

It is often useful for one language's syntax file to include a syntax file for
a related language.  Depending on the exact relationship, this can be done in
two different ways:

	- If top-level syntax items in the included syntax file are to be
	  allowed at the top level in the including syntax, you can simply use
	  the |:runtime| command: >

  " In cpp.vim:
  :runtime! syntax/c.vim
  :unlet b:current_syntax

<	- If top-level syntax items in the included syntax file are to be
	  contained within a region in the including syntax, you can use the
	  ":syntax include" command:

:sy[ntax] include [@{grouplist-name}] {file-name}

	  All syntax items declared in the included file will have the
	  "contained" flag added.  In addition, if a group list is specified,
	  all top-level syntax items in the included file will be added to
	  that list. >

   " In perl.vim:
   :syntax include @Pod <sfile>:p:h/pod.vim
   :syntax region perlPOD start="^=head" end="^=cut" contains=@Pod
<
	  When {file-name} is an absolute path (starts with "/", "c:", "$VAR"
	  or "<sfile>") that file is sourced.  When it is a relative path
	  (e.g., "syntax/pod.vim") the file is searched for in 'runtimepath'.
	  All matching files are loaded.  Using a relative path is
	  recommended, because it allows a user to replace the included file
	  with his own version, without replacing the file that does the ":syn
	  include".

						*E847*
The maximum number of includes is 999.

==============================================================================
10. Synchronizing				*:syn-sync* *E403* *E404*

Vim wants to be able to start redrawing in any position in the document.  To
make this possible it needs to know the syntax state at the position where
redrawing starts.

:sy[ntax] sync [ccomment [group-name] | minlines={N} | ...]

There are four ways to synchronize:
1. Always parse from the start of the file.
   |:syn-sync-first|
2. Based on C-style comments.  Vim understands how C-comments work and can
   figure out if the current line starts inside or outside a comment.
   |:syn-sync-second|
3. Jumping back a certain number of lines and start parsing there.
   |:syn-sync-third|
4. Searching backwards in the text for a pattern to sync on.
   |:syn-sync-fourth|

				*:syn-sync-maxlines* *:syn-sync-minlines*
For the last three methods, the line range where the parsing can start is
limited by "minlines" and "maxlines".

If the "minlines={N}" argument is given, the parsing always starts at least
that many lines backwards.  This can be used if the parsing may take a few
lines before it's correct, or when it's not possible to use syncing.

If the "maxlines={N}" argument is given, the number of lines that are searched
for a comment or syncing pattern is restricted to N lines backwards (after
adding "minlines").  This is useful if you have few things to sync on and a
slow machine.  Example: >
   :syntax sync ccomment maxlines=500
<
						*:syn-sync-linebreaks*
When using a pattern that matches multiple lines, a change in one line may
cause a pattern to no longer match in a previous line.	This means has to
start above where the change was made.	How many lines can be specified with
the "linebreaks" argument.  For example, when a pattern may include one line
break use this: >
   :syntax sync linebreaks=1
The result is that redrawing always starts at least one line before where a
change was made.  The default value for "linebreaks" is zero.  Usually the
value for "minlines" is bigger than "linebreaks".


First syncing method:			*:syn-sync-first*
>
   :syntax sync fromstart

The file will be parsed from the start.  This makes syntax highlighting
accurate, but can be slow for long files.  Vim caches previously parsed text,
so that it's only slow when parsing the text for the first time.  However,
when making changes some part of the text needs to be parsed again (worst
case: to the end of the file).

Using "fromstart" is equivalent to using "minlines" with a very large number.


Second syncing method:			*:syn-sync-second* *:syn-sync-ccomment*

For the second method, only the "ccomment" argument needs to be given.
Example: >
   :syntax sync ccomment

When Vim finds that the line where displaying starts is inside a C-style
comment, the last region syntax item with the group-name "Comment" will be
used.  This requires that there is a region with the group-name "Comment"!
An alternate group name can be specified, for example: >
   :syntax sync ccomment javaComment
This means that the last item specified with "syn region javaComment" will be
used for the detected C comment region.  This only works properly if that
region does have a start pattern "\/*" and an end pattern "*\/".

The "maxlines" argument can be used to restrict the search to a number of
lines.	The "minlines" argument can be used to at least start a number of
lines back (e.g., for when there is some construct that only takes a few
lines, but it hard to sync on).

Note: Syncing on a C comment doesn't work properly when strings are used
that cross a line and contain a "*/".  Since letting strings cross a line
is a bad programming habit (many compilers give a warning message), and the
chance of a "*/" appearing inside a comment is very small, this restriction
is hardly ever noticed.


Third syncing method:				*:syn-sync-third*

For the third method, only the "minlines={N}" argument needs to be given.
Vim will subtract {N} from the line number and start parsing there.  This
means {N} extra lines need to be parsed, which makes this method a bit slower.
Example: >
   :syntax sync minlines=50

"lines" is equivalent to "minlines" (used by older versions).


Fourth syncing method:				*:syn-sync-fourth*

The idea is to synchronize on the end of a few specific regions, called a
sync pattern.  Only regions can cross lines, so when we find the end of some
region, we might be able to know in which syntax item we are.  The search
starts in the line just above the one where redrawing starts.  From there
the search continues backwards in the file.

This works just like the non-syncing syntax items.  You can use contained
matches, nextgroup, etc.  But there are a few differences:
- Keywords cannot be used.
- The syntax items with the "sync" keyword form a completely separated group
  of syntax items.  You can't mix syncing groups and non-syncing groups.
- The matching works backwards in the buffer (line by line), instead of
  forwards.
- A line continuation pattern can be given.  It is used to decide which group
  of lines need to be searched like they were one line.  This means that the
  search for a match with the specified items starts in the first of the
  consecutive that contain the continuation pattern.
- When using "nextgroup" or "contains", this only works within one line (or
  group of continued lines).
- When using a region, it must start and end in the same line (or group of
  continued lines).  Otherwise the end is assumed to be at the end of the
  line (or group of continued lines).
- When a match with a sync pattern is found, the rest of the line (or group of
  continued lines) is searched for another match.  The last match is used.
  This is used when a line can contain both the start end the end of a region
  (e.g., in a C-comment like /* this */, the last "*/" is used).

There are two ways how a match with a sync pattern can be used:
1. Parsing for highlighting starts where redrawing starts (and where the
   search for the sync pattern started).  The syntax group that is expected
   to be valid there must be specified.  This works well when the regions
   that cross lines cannot contain other regions.
2. Parsing for highlighting continues just after the match.  The syntax group
   that is expected to be present just after the match must be specified.
   This can be used when the previous method doesn't work well.  It's much
   slower, because more text needs to be parsed.
Both types of sync patterns can be used at the same time.

Besides the sync patterns, other matches and regions can be specified, to
avoid finding unwanted matches.

[The reason that the sync patterns are given separately, is that mostly the
search for the sync point can be much simpler than figuring out the
highlighting.  The reduced number of patterns means it will go (much)
faster.]

					    *syn-sync-grouphere* *E393* *E394*
    :syntax sync match {sync-group-name} grouphere {group-name} "pattern" ..

	Define a match that is used for syncing.  {group-name} is the
	name of a syntax group that follows just after the match.  Parsing
	of the text for highlighting starts just after the match.  A region
	must exist for this {group-name}.  The first one defined will be used.
	"NONE" can be used for when there is no syntax group after the match.

						*syn-sync-groupthere*
    :syntax sync match {sync-group-name} groupthere {group-name} "pattern" ..

	Like "grouphere", but {group-name} is the name of a syntax group that
	is to be used at the start of the line where searching for the sync
	point started.	The text between the match and the start of the sync
	pattern searching is assumed not to change the syntax highlighting.
	For example, in C you could search backwards for "/*" and "*/".  If
	"/*" is found first, you know that you are inside a comment, so the
	"groupthere" is "cComment".  If "*/" is found first, you know that you
	are not in a comment, so the "groupthere" is "NONE".  (in practice
	it's a bit more complicated, because the "/*" and "*/" could appear
	inside a string.  That's left as an exercise to the reader...).

    :syntax sync match ..
    :syntax sync region ..

	Without a "groupthere" argument.  Define a region or match that is
	skipped while searching for a sync point.

						*syn-sync-linecont*
    :syntax sync linecont {pattern}

	When {pattern} matches in a line, it is considered to continue in
	the next line.	This means that the search for a sync point will
	consider the lines to be concatenated.

If the "maxlines={N}" argument is given too, the number of lines that are
searched for a match is restricted to N.  This is useful if you have very
few things to sync on and a slow machine.  Example: >
   :syntax sync maxlines=100

You can clear all sync settings with: >
   :syntax sync clear

You can clear specific sync patterns with: >
   :syntax sync clear {sync-group-name} ..

==============================================================================
11. Listing syntax items		*:syntax* *:sy* *:syn* *:syn-list*

This command lists all the syntax items: >

    :sy[ntax] [list]

To show the syntax items for one syntax group: >

    :sy[ntax] list {group-name}

To list the syntax groups in one cluster:			*E392*	 >

    :sy[ntax] list @{cluster-name}

See above for other arguments for the ":syntax" command.

Note that the ":syntax" command can be abbreviated to ":sy", although ":syn"
is mostly used, because it looks better.

==============================================================================
12. Highlight command			*:highlight* *:hi* *E28* *E411* *E415*

There are three types of highlight groups:
- The ones used for specific languages.  For these the name starts with the
  name of the language.  Many of these don't have any attributes, but are
  linked to a group of the second type.
- The ones used for all syntax languages.
- The ones used for the 'highlight' option.
							*hitest.vim*
You can see all the groups currently active with this command: >
    :so $VIMRUNTIME/syntax/hitest.vim
This will open a new window containing all highlight group names, displayed
in their own color.

						*:colo* *:colorscheme* *E185*
:colo[rscheme]		Output the name of the currently active color scheme.
			This is basically the same as >
				:echo g:colors_name
<			In case g:colors_name has not been defined :colo will
			output "default".  When compiled without the |+eval|
			feature it will output "unknown".

:colo[rscheme] {name}	Load color scheme {name}.  This searches 'runtimepath'
			for the file "colors/{name}.vim".  The first one that
			is found is loaded.
			To see the name of the currently active color scheme: >
				:colo
<			The name is also stored in the g:colors_name variable.
			Doesn't work recursively, thus you can't use
			":colorscheme" in a color scheme script.
			After the color scheme has been loaded the
			|ColorScheme| autocommand event is triggered.
			For info about writing a colorscheme file: >
				:edit $VIMRUNTIME/colors/README.txt

:hi[ghlight]		List all the current highlight groups that have
			attributes set.

:hi[ghlight] {group-name}
			List one highlight group.

:hi[ghlight] clear	Reset all highlighting to the defaults.  Removes all
			highlighting for groups added by the user!
			Uses the current value of 'background' to decide which
			default colors to use.

:hi[ghlight] clear {group-name}
:hi[ghlight] {group-name} NONE
			Disable the highlighting for one highlight group.  It
			is _not_ set back to the default colors.

:hi[ghlight] [default] {group-name} {key}={arg} ..
			Add a highlight group, or change the highlighting for
			an existing group.
			See |highlight-args| for the {key}={arg} arguments.
			See |:highlight-default| for the optional [default]
			argument.

Normally a highlight group is added once when starting up.  This sets the
default values for the highlighting.  After that, you can use additional
highlight commands to change the arguments that you want to set to non-default
values.  The value "NONE" can be used to switch the value off or go back to
the default value.

A simple way to change colors is with the |:colorscheme| command.  This loads
a file with ":highlight" commands such as this: >

   :hi Comment	gui=bold

Note that all settings that are not included remain the same, only the
specified field is used, and settings are merged with previous ones.  So, the
result is like this single command has been used: >
   :hi Comment	term=bold ctermfg=Cyan guifg=#80a0ff gui=bold
<
							*:highlight-verbose*
When listing a highlight group and 'verbose' is non-zero, the listing will
also tell where it was last set.  Example: >
	:verbose hi Comment
<	Comment        xxx term=bold ctermfg=4 guifg=Blue ~
	   Last set from /home/mool/vim/vim7/runtime/syntax/syncolor.vim ~

When ":hi clear" is used then the script where this command is used will be
mentioned for the default values. See |:verbose-cmd| for more information.

					*highlight-args* *E416* *E417* *E423*
There are three types of terminals for highlighting:
term	a normal terminal (vt100, xterm)
cterm	a color terminal (MS-DOS console, color-xterm, these have the "Co"
	termcap entry)
gui	the GUI

For each type the highlighting can be given.  This makes it possible to use
the same syntax file on all terminals, and use the optimal highlighting.

1. highlight arguments for normal terminals

					*bold* *underline* *undercurl*
					*inverse* *italic* *standout*
term={attr-list}			*attr-list* *highlight-term* *E418*
	attr-list is a comma separated list (without spaces) of the
	following items (in any order):
		bold
		underline
		undercurl	not always available
		reverse
		inverse		same as reverse
		italic
		standout
		NONE		no attributes used (used to reset it)

	Note that "bold" can be used here and by using a bold font.  They
	have the same effect.
	"undercurl" is a curly underline.  When "undercurl" is not possible
	then "underline" is used.  In general "undercurl" is only available in
	the GUI.  The color is set with |highlight-guisp|.

start={term-list}				*highlight-start* *E422*
stop={term-list}				*term-list* *highlight-stop*
	These lists of terminal codes can be used to get
	non-standard attributes on a terminal.

	The escape sequence specified with the "start" argument
	is written before the characters in the highlighted
	area.  It can be anything that you want to send to the
	terminal to highlight this area.  The escape sequence
	specified with the "stop" argument is written after the
	highlighted area.  This should undo the "start" argument.
	Otherwise the screen will look messed up.

	The {term-list} can have two forms:

	1. A string with escape sequences.
	   This is any string of characters, except that it can't start with
	   "t_" and blanks are not allowed.  The <> notation is recognized
	   here, so you can use things like "<Esc>" and "<Space>".  Example:
		start=<Esc>[27h;<Esc>[<Space>r;

	2. A list of terminal codes.
	   Each terminal code has the form "t_xx", where "xx" is the name of
	   the termcap entry.  The codes have to be separated with commas.
	   White space is not allowed.	Example:
		start=t_C1,t_BL
	   The terminal codes must exist for this to work.


2. highlight arguments for color terminals

cterm={attr-list}					*highlight-cterm*
	See above for the description of {attr-list} |attr-list|.
	The "cterm" argument is likely to be different from "term", when
	colors are used.  For example, in a normal terminal comments could
	be underlined, in a color terminal they can be made Blue.
	Note: Many terminals (e.g., DOS console) can't mix these attributes
	with coloring.	Use only one of "cterm=" OR "ctermfg=" OR "ctermbg=".

ctermfg={color-nr}				*highlight-ctermfg* *E421*
ctermbg={color-nr}				*highlight-ctermbg*
	The {color-nr} argument is a color number.  Its range is zero to
	(not including) the number given by the termcap entry "Co".
	The actual color with this number depends on the type of terminal
	and its settings.  Sometimes the color also depends on the settings of
	"cterm".  For example, on some systems "cterm=bold ctermfg=3" gives
	another color, on others you just get color 3.

	For an xterm this depends on your resources, and is a bit
	unpredictable.	See your xterm documentation for the defaults.	The
	colors for a color-xterm can be changed from the .Xdefaults file.
	Unfortunately this means that it's not possible to get the same colors
	for each user.	See |xterm-color| for info about color xterms.

	The MSDOS standard colors are fixed (in a console window), so these
	have been used for the names.  But the meaning of color names in X11
	are fixed, so these color settings have been used, to make the
	highlighting settings portable (complicated, isn't it?).  The
	following names are recognized, with the color number used:

							*cterm-colors*
	    NR-16   NR-8    COLOR NAME ~
	    0	    0	    Black
	    1	    4	    DarkBlue
	    2	    2	    DarkGreen
	    3	    6	    DarkCyan
	    4	    1	    DarkRed
	    5	    5	    DarkMagenta
	    6	    3	    Brown, DarkYellow
	    7	    7	    LightGray, LightGrey, Gray, Grey
	    8	    0*	    DarkGray, DarkGrey
	    9	    4*	    Blue, LightBlue
	    10	    2*	    Green, LightGreen
	    11	    6*	    Cyan, LightCyan
	    12	    1*	    Red, LightRed
	    13	    5*	    Magenta, LightMagenta
	    14	    3*	    Yellow, LightYellow
	    15	    7*	    White

	The number under "NR-16" is used for 16-color terminals ('t_Co'
	greater than or equal to 16).  The number under "NR-8" is used for
	8-color terminals ('t_Co' less than 16).  The '*' indicates that the
	bold attribute is set for ctermfg.  In many 8-color terminals (e.g.,
	"linux"), this causes the bright colors to appear.  This doesn't work
	for background colors!	Without the '*' the bold attribute is removed.
	If you want to set the bold attribute in a different way, put a
	"cterm=" argument AFTER the "ctermfg=" or "ctermbg=" argument.	Or use
	a number instead of a color name.

	The case of the color names is ignored.
	Note that for 16 color ansi style terminals (including xterms), the
	numbers in the NR-8 column is used.  Here '*' means 'add 8' so that Blue
	is 12, DarkGray is 8 etc.

	Note that for some color terminals these names may result in the wrong
	colors!

							*:hi-normal-cterm*
	When setting the "ctermfg" or "ctermbg" colors for the Normal group,
	these will become the colors used for the non-highlighted text.
	Example: >
		:highlight Normal ctermfg=grey ctermbg=darkblue
<	When setting the "ctermbg" color for the Normal group, the
	'background' option will be adjusted automatically.  This causes the
	highlight groups that depend on 'background' to change!  This means
	you should set the colors for Normal first, before setting other
	colors.
	When a colorscheme is being used, changing 'background' causes it to
	be reloaded, which may reset all colors (including Normal).  First
	delete the "g:colors_name" variable when you don't want this.

	When you have set "ctermfg" or "ctermbg" for the Normal group, Vim
	needs to reset the color when exiting.	This is done with the "op"
	termcap entry |t_op|.  If this doesn't work correctly, try setting the
	't_op' option in your .vimrc.
							*E419* *E420*
	When Vim knows the normal foreground and background colors, "fg" and
	"bg" can be used as color names.  This only works after setting the
	colors for the Normal group and for the MS-DOS console.  Example, for
	reverse video: >
	    :highlight Visual ctermfg=bg ctermbg=fg
<	Note that the colors are used that are valid at the moment this
	command are given.  If the Normal group colors are changed later, the
	"fg" and "bg" colors will not be adjusted.


3. highlight arguments for the GUI

gui={attr-list}						*highlight-gui*
	These give the attributes to use in the GUI mode.
	See |attr-list| for a description.
	Note that "bold" can be used here and by using a bold font.  They
	have the same effect.
	Note that the attributes are ignored for the "Normal" group.

font={font-name}					*highlight-font*
	font-name is the name of a font, as it is used on the system Vim
	runs on.  For X11 this is a complicated name, for example: >
   font=-misc-fixed-bold-r-normal--14-130-75-75-c-70-iso8859-1
<
	The font-name "NONE" can be used to revert to the default font.
	When setting the font for the "Normal" group, this becomes the default
	font (until the 'guifont' option is changed; the last one set is
	used).
	The following only works with Motif and Athena, not with other GUIs:
	When setting the font for the "Menu" group, the menus will be changed.
	When setting the font for the "Tooltip" group, the tooltips will be
	changed.
	All fonts used, except for Menu and Tooltip, should be of the same
	character size as the default font!  Otherwise redrawing problems will
	occur.

guifg={color-name}					*highlight-guifg*
guibg={color-name}					*highlight-guibg*
guisp={color-name}					*highlight-guisp*
	These give the foreground (guifg), background (guibg) and special
	(guisp) color to use in the GUI.  "guisp" is used for undercurl.
	There are a few special names:
		NONE		no color (transparent)
		bg		use normal background color
		background	use normal background color
		fg		use normal foreground color
		foreground	use normal foreground color
	To use a color name with an embedded space or other special character,
	put it in single quotes.  The single quote cannot be used then.
	Example: >
	    :hi comment guifg='salmon pink'
<
							*gui-colors*
	Suggested color names (these are available on most systems):
	    Red		LightRed	DarkRed
	    Green	LightGreen	DarkGreen	SeaGreen
	    Blue	LightBlue	DarkBlue	SlateBlue
	    Cyan	LightCyan	DarkCyan
	    Magenta	LightMagenta	DarkMagenta
	    Yellow	LightYellow	Brown		DarkYellow
	    Gray	LightGray	DarkGray
	    Black	White
	    Orange	Purple		Violet

	In the Win32 GUI version, additional system colors are available.  See
	|win32-colors|.

	You can also specify a color by its Red, Green and Blue values.
	The format is "#rrggbb", where
		"rr"	is the Red value
		"gg"	is the Green value
		"bb"	is the Blue value
	All values are hexadecimal, range from "00" to "ff".  Examples: >
  :highlight Comment guifg=#11f0c3 guibg=#ff00ff
<
					*highlight-groups* *highlight-default*

Title		titles for output from ":set all", ":autocmd" etc.
							*hl-Visual*
Visual		Visual mode selection
							*hl-VisualNOS*
VisualNOS	Visual mode selection when vim is "Not Owning the Selection".
		Only X11 Gui's |gui-x11| and |xterm-clipboard| supports this.
							*hl-WarningMsg*
WarningMsg	warning messages
							*hl-WildMenu*
WildMenu	current match in 'wildmenu' completion

					*hl-User1* *hl-User1..9* *hl-User9*
The 'statusline' syntax allows the use of 9 different highlights in the
statusline and ruler (via 'rulerformat').  The names are User1 to User9.

For the GUI you can use the following groups to set the colors for the menu,
scrollbars and tooltips.  They don't have defaults.  This doesn't work for the
Win32 GUI.  Only three highlight arguments have any effect here: font, guibg,
and guifg.

							*hl-Menu*
Menu		Current font, background and foreground colors of the menus.
		Also used for the toolbar.
		Applicable highlight arguments: font, guibg, guifg.

		NOTE: For Motif and Athena the font argument actually
		specifies a fontset at all times, no matter if 'guifontset' is
		empty, and as such it is tied to the current |:language| when
		set.

							*hl-Scrollbar*
Scrollbar	Current background and foreground of the main window's
		scrollbars.
		Applicable highlight arguments: guibg, guifg.

							*hl-Tooltip*
Tooltip		Current font, background and foreground of the tooltips.
		Applicable highlight arguments: font, guibg, guifg.

		NOTE: For Motif and Athena the font argument actually
		specifies a fontset at all times, no matter if 'guifontset' is
		empty, and as such it is tied to the current |:language| when
		set.

==============================================================================
13. Linking groups		*:hi-link* *:highlight-link* *E412* *E413*

When you want to use the same highlighting for several syntax groups, you
can do this more easily by linking the groups into one common highlight
group, and give the color attributes only for that group.

To set a link:

    :hi[ghlight][!] [default] link {from-group} {to-group}

To remove a link:

    :hi[ghlight][!] [default] link {from-group} NONE

Notes:							*E414*
- If the {from-group} and/or {to-group} doesn't exist, it is created.  You
  don't get an error message for a non-existing group.
- As soon as you use a ":highlight" command for a linked group, the link is
  removed.
- If there are already highlight settings for the {from-group}, the link is
  not made, unless the '!' is given.  For a ":highlight link" command in a
  sourced file, you don't get an error message.  This can be used to skip
  links for groups that already have settings.

					*:hi-default* *:highlight-default*
The [default] argument is used for setting the default highlighting for a
group.	If highlighting has already been specified for the group the command
will be ignored.  Also when there is an existing link.

Using [default] is especially useful to overrule the highlighting of a
specific syntax file.  For example, the C syntax file contains: >
	:highlight default link cComment Comment
If you like Question highlighting for C comments, put this in your vimrc file: >
	:highlight link cComment Question
Without the "default" in the C syntax file, the highlighting would be
overruled when the syntax file is loaded.

==============================================================================
14. Cleaning up						*:syn-clear* *E391*

If you want to clear the syntax stuff for the current buffer, you can use this
command: >
  :syntax clear

This command should be used when you want to switch off syntax highlighting,
or when you want to switch to using another syntax.  It's normally not needed
in a syntax file itself, because syntax is cleared by the autocommands that
load the syntax file.
The command also deletes the "b:current_syntax" variable, since no syntax is
loaded after this command.

If you want to disable syntax highlighting for all buffers, you need to remove
the autocommands that load the syntax files: >
  :syntax off

What this command actually does, is executing the command >
  :source $VIMRUNTIME/syntax/nosyntax.vim
See the "nosyntax.vim" file for details.  Note that for this to work
$VIMRUNTIME must be valid.  See |$VIMRUNTIME|.

To clean up specific syntax groups for the current buffer: >
  :syntax clear {group-name} ..
This removes all patterns and keywords for {group-name}.

To clean up specific syntax group lists for the current buffer: >
  :syntax clear @{grouplist-name} ..
This sets {grouplist-name}'s contents to an empty list.

						*:syntax-reset* *:syn-reset*
If you have changed the colors and messed them up, use this command to get the
defaults back: >

  :syntax reset

This doesn't change the colors for the 'highlight' option.

Note that the syntax colors that you set in your vimrc file will also be reset
back to their Vim default.
Note that if you are using a color scheme, the colors defined by the color
scheme for syntax highlighting will be lost.

What this actually does is: >

	let g:syntax_cmd = "reset"
	runtime! syntax/syncolor.vim

Note that this uses the 'runtimepath' option.

							*syncolor*
If you want to use different colors for syntax highlighting, you can add a Vim
script file to set these colors.  Put this file in a directory in
'runtimepath' which comes after $VIMRUNTIME, so that your settings overrule
the default colors.  This way these colors will be used after the ":syntax
reset" command.

For Unix you can use the file ~/.vim/after/syntax/syncolor.vim.  Example: >

	if &background == "light"
	  highlight comment ctermfg=darkgreen guifg=darkgreen
	else
	  highlight comment ctermfg=green guifg=green
	endif

								*E679*
Do make sure this syncolor.vim script does not use a "syntax on", set the
'background' option or uses a "colorscheme" command, because it results in an
endless loop.

Note that when a color scheme is used, there might be some confusion whether
your defined colors are to be used or the colors from the scheme.  This
depends on the color scheme file.  See |:colorscheme|.

							*syntax_cmd*
The "syntax_cmd" variable is set to one of these values when the
syntax/syncolor.vim files are loaded:
   "on"		":syntax on" command.  Highlight colors are overruled but
		links are kept
   "enable"	":syntax enable" command.  Only define colors for groups that
		don't have highlighting yet.  Use ":syntax default".
   "reset"	":syntax reset" command or loading a color scheme.  Define all
		the colors.
   "skip"	Don't define colors.  Used to skip the default settings when a
		syncolor.vim file earlier in 'runtimepath' has already set
		them.

==============================================================================
15. Highlighting tags					*tag-highlight*

If you want to highlight all the tags in your file, you can use the following
mappings.

	<F11>	-- Generate tags.vim file, and highlight tags.
	<F12>	-- Just highlight tags based on existing tags.vim file.
>
  :map <F11>  :sp tags<CR>:%s/^\([^	:]*:\)\=\([^	]*\).*/syntax keyword Tag \2/<CR>:wq! tags.vim<CR>/^<CR><F12>
  :map <F12>  :so tags.vim<CR>

WARNING: The longer the tags file, the slower this will be, and the more
memory Vim will consume.

Only highlighting typedefs, unions and structs can be done too.  For this you
must use Exuberant ctags (found at http://ctags.sf.net).

Put these lines in your Makefile:

# Make a highlight file for types.  Requires Exuberant ctags and awk
types: types.vim
types.vim: *.[ch]
	ctags --c-kinds=gstu -o- *.[ch] |\
		awk 'BEGIN{printf("syntax keyword Type\t")}\
			{printf("%s ", $$1)}END{print ""}' > $@

And put these lines in your .vimrc: >

   " load the types.vim highlighting file, if it exists
   autocmd BufRead,BufNewFile *.[ch] let fname = expand('<afile>:p:h') . '/types.vim'
   autocmd BufRead,BufNewFile *.[ch] if filereadable(fname)
   autocmd BufRead,BufNewFile *.[ch]   exe 'so ' . fname
   autocmd BufRead,BufNewFile *.[ch] endif

==============================================================================
16. Window-local syntax				*:ownsyntax*

Normally all windows on a buffer share the same syntax settings. It is
possible, however, to set a particular window on a file to have its own
private syntax setting. A possible example would be to edit LaTeX source
with conventional highlighting in one window, while seeing the same source
highlighted differently (so as to hide control sequences and indicate bold,
italic etc regions) in another. The 'scrollbind' option is useful here.

To set the current window to have the syntax "foo", separately from all other
windows on the buffer: >
   :ownsyntax foo
<						*w:current_syntax*
This will set the "w:current_syntax" variable to "foo".  The value of
"b:current_syntax" does not change.  This is implemented by saving and
restoring "b:current_syntax", since the syntax files do set
"b:current_syntax".  The value set by the syntax file is assigned to
"w:current_syntax".

Once a window has its own syntax, syntax commands executed from other windows
on the same buffer (including :syntax clear) have no effect. Conversely,
syntax commands executed from that window do not affect other windows on the
same buffer.

A window with its own syntax reverts to normal behavior when another buffer
is loaded into that window or the file is reloaded.
When splitting the window, the new window will use the original syntax.

==============================================================================
17. Color xterms				*xterm-color* *color-xterm*

Most color xterms have only eight colors.  If you don't get colors with the
default setup, it should work with these lines in your .vimrc: >
   :if &term =~ "xterm"
   :  if has("terminfo")
   :	set t_Co=8
   :	set t_Sf=<Esc>[3%p1%dm
   :	set t_Sb=<Esc>[4%p1%dm
   :  else
   :	set t_Co=8
   :	set t_Sf=<Esc>[3%dm
   :	set t_Sb=<Esc>[4%dm
   :  endif
   :endif
<	[<Esc> is a real escape, type CTRL-V <Esc>]

You might want to change the first "if" to match the name of your terminal,
e.g. "dtterm" instead of "xterm".

Note: Do these settings BEFORE doing ":syntax on".  Otherwise the colors may
be wrong.
							*xiterm* *rxvt*
The above settings have been mentioned to work for xiterm and rxvt too.
But for using 16 colors in an rxvt these should work with terminfo: >
	:set t_AB=<Esc>[%?%p1%{8}%<%t25;%p1%{40}%+%e5;%p1%{32}%+%;%dm
	:set t_AF=<Esc>[%?%p1%{8}%<%t22;%p1%{30}%+%e1;%p1%{22}%+%;%dm
<
							*colortest.vim*
To test your color setup, a file has been included in the Vim distribution.
To use it, execute this command: >
   :runtime syntax/colortest.vim

Some versions of xterm (and other terminals, like the Linux console) can
output lighter foreground colors, even though the number of colors is defined
at 8.  Therefore Vim sets the "cterm=bold" attribute for light foreground
colors, when 't_Co' is 8.

							*xfree-xterm*
To get 16 colors or more, get the newest xterm version (which should be
included with XFree86 3.3 and later).  You can also find the latest version
at: >
	http://invisible-island.net/xterm/xterm.html
Here is a good way to configure it.  This uses 88 colors and enables the
termcap-query feature, which allows Vim to ask the xterm how many colors it
supports. >
	./configure --disable-bold-color --enable-88-color --enable-tcap-query
If you only get 8 colors, check the xterm compilation settings.
(Also see |UTF8-xterm| for using this xterm with UTF-8 character encoding).

This xterm should work with these lines in your .vimrc (for 16 colors): >
   :if has("terminfo")
   :  set t_Co=16
   :  set t_AB=<Esc>[%?%p1%{8}%<%t%p1%{40}%+%e%p1%{92}%+%;%dm
   :  set t_AF=<Esc>[%?%p1%{8}%<%t%p1%{30}%+%e%p1%{82}%+%;%dm
   :else
   :  set t_Co=16
   :  set t_Sf=<Esc>[3%dm
   :  set t_Sb=<Esc>[4%dm
   :endif
<	[<Esc> is a real escape, type CTRL-V <Esc>]

Without |+terminfo|, Vim will recognize these settings, and automatically
translate cterm colors of 8 and above to "<Esc>[9%dm" and "<Esc>[10%dm".
Colors above 16 are also translated automatically.

For 256 colors this has been reported to work: >

   :set t_AB=<Esc>[48;5;%dm
   :set t_AF=<Esc>[38;5;%dm

Or just set the TERM environment variable to "xterm-color" or "xterm-16color"
and try if that works.

You probably want to use these X resources (in your ~/.Xdefaults file):
	XTerm*color0:			#000000
	XTerm*color1:			#c00000
	XTerm*color2:			#008000
	XTerm*color3:			#808000
	XTerm*color4:			#0000c0
	XTerm*color5:			#c000c0
	XTerm*color6:			#008080
	XTerm*color7:			#c0c0c0
	XTerm*color8:			#808080
	XTerm*color9:			#ff6060
	XTerm*color10:			#00ff00
	XTerm*color11:			#ffff00
	XTerm*color12:			#8080ff
	XTerm*color13:			#ff40ff
	XTerm*color14:			#00ffff
	XTerm*color15:			#ffffff
	Xterm*cursorColor:		Black

[Note: The cursorColor is required to work around a bug, which changes the
cursor color to the color of the last drawn text.  This has been fixed by a
newer version of xterm, but not everybody is using it yet.]

To get these right away, reload the .Xdefaults file to the X Option database
Manager (you only need to do this when you just changed the .Xdefaults file): >
  xrdb -merge ~/.Xdefaults
<
					*xterm-blink* *xterm-blinking-cursor*
To make the cursor blink in an xterm, see tools/blink.c.  Or use Thomas
Dickey's xterm above patchlevel 107 (see above for where to get it), with
these resources:
	XTerm*cursorBlink:	on
	XTerm*cursorOnTime:	400
	XTerm*cursorOffTime:	250
	XTerm*cursorColor:	White

							*hpterm-color*
These settings work (more or less) for an hpterm, which only supports 8
foreground colors: >
   :if has("terminfo")
   :  set t_Co=8
   :  set t_Sf=<Esc>[&v%p1%dS
   :  set t_Sb=<Esc>[&v7S
   :else
   :  set t_Co=8
   :  set t_Sf=<Esc>[&v%dS
   :  set t_Sb=<Esc>[&v7S
   :endif
<	[<Esc> is a real escape, type CTRL-V <Esc>]

						*Eterm* *enlightened-terminal*
These settings have been reported to work for the Enlightened terminal
emulator, or Eterm.  They might work for all xterm-like terminals that use the
bold attribute to get bright colors.  Add an ":if" like above when needed. >
       :set t_Co=16
       :set t_AF=^[[%?%p1%{8}%<%t3%p1%d%e%p1%{22}%+%d;1%;m
       :set t_AB=^[[%?%p1%{8}%<%t4%p1%d%e%p1%{32}%+%d;1%;m
<
						*TTpro-telnet*
These settings should work for TTpro telnet.  Tera Term Pro is a freeware /
open-source program for MS-Windows. >
	set t_Co=16
	set t_AB=^[[%?%p1%{8}%<%t%p1%{40}%+%e%p1%{32}%+5;%;%dm
	set t_AF=^[[%?%p1%{8}%<%t%p1%{30}%+%e%p1%{22}%+1;%;%dm
Also make sure TTpro's Setup / Window / Full Color is enabled, and make sure
that Setup / Font / Enable Bold is NOT enabled.

==============================================================================
18. When syntax is slow						*:syntime*

This is aimed at authors of a syntax file.

If your syntax causes redrawing to be slow, here are a few hints on making it
faster.  To see slowness switch on some features that usually interfere, such
as 'relativenumber' and |folding|.

Note: this is only available when compiled with the |+profile| feature.
You many need to build Vim with "huge" features.

To find out what patterns are consuming most time, get an overview with this
sequence: >
	:syntime on
	[ redraw the text at least once with CTRL-L ]
	:syntime report

This will display a list of syntax patterns that were used, sorted by the time
it took to match them against the text.

:syntime on		Start measuring syntax times.  This will add some
			overhead to compute the time spent on syntax pattern
			matching.

:syntime off		Stop measuring syntax times.

:syntime clear		Set all the counters to zero, restart measuring.

:syntime report		Show the syntax items used since ":syntime on" in the
			current window.  Use a wider display to see more of
			the output.

			The list is sorted by total time. The columns are:
			TOTAL		Total time in seconds spent on
					matching this pattern.
			COUNT		Number of times the pattern was used.
			MATCH		Number of times the pattern actually
					matched
			SLOWEST		The longest time for one try.
			AVERAGE		The average time for one try.
			NAME		Name of the syntax item.  Note that
					this is not unique.
			PATTERN		The pattern being used.

Pattern matching gets slow when it has to try many alternatives.  Try to
include as much literal text as possible to reduce the number of ways a
pattern does NOT match.

When using the "\@<=" and "\@<!" items, add a maximum size to avoid trying at
all positions in the current and previous line.  For example, if the item is
literal text specify the size of that text (in bytes):

"<\@<=span"	Matches "span" in "<span".  This tries matching with "<" in
		many places.
"<\@1<=span"	Matches the same, but only tries one byte before "span".

Vim has a number of internal variables and switches which can be set to
achieve special effects.  These options come in three forms:
	boolean		can only be on or off		*boolean* *toggle*
	number		has a numeric value
	string		has a string value

==============================================================================
1. Setting options					*set-option* *E764*

							*:se* *:set*
:se[t]			Show all options that differ from their default value.

:se[t] all		Show all but terminal options.

:se[t] termcap		Show all terminal options.  Note that in the GUI the
			key codes are not shown, because they are generated
			internally and can't be changed.  Changing the terminal
			codes in the GUI is not useful either...

								*E518* *E519*
:se[t] {option}?	Show value of {option}.

:se[t] {option}		Toggle option: set, switch it on.
			Number option: show value.
			String option: show value.

:se[t] no{option}	Toggle option: Reset, switch it off.

							   *:set-!* *:set-inv*
:se[t] {option}!   or
:se[t] inv{option}	Toggle option: Invert value. {not in Vi}

				*:set-default* *:set-&* *:set-&vi* *:set-&vim*
:se[t] {option}&	Reset option to its default value.  May depend on the
			current value of 'compatible'. {not in Vi}
:se[t] {option}&vi	Reset option to its Vi default value. {not in Vi}
:se[t] {option}&vim	Reset option to its Vim default value. {not in Vi}

:se[t] all&		Set all options, except terminal options, to their
			default value.  The values of 'term', 'lines' and
			'columns' are not changed. {not in Vi}

						*:set-args* *E487* *E521*
:se[t] {option}={value}		or
:se[t] {option}:{value}
			Set string or number option to {value}.
			For numeric options the value can be given in decimal,
			hex (preceded with 0x) or octal (preceded with '0')
			(hex and octal are only available for machines which
			have the strtol() function).
			The old value can be inserted by typing 'wildchar' (by
			default this is a <Tab> or CTRL-E if 'compatible' is
			set).  See |cmdline-completion|.
			White space between {option} and '=' is allowed and
			will be ignored.  White space between '=' and {value}
			is not allowed.
			See |option-backslash| for using white space and
			backslashes in {value}.

:se[t] {option}+={value}				*:set+=*
			Add the {value} to a number option, or append the
			{value} to a string option.  When the option is a
			comma separated list, a comma is added, unless the
			value was empty.
			If the option is a list of flags, superfluous flags
			are removed.  When adding a flag that was already
			present the option value doesn't change.
			Also see |:set-args| above.
			{not in Vi}

:se[t] {option}^={value}				*:set^=*
			Multiply the {value} to a number option, or prepend
			the {value} to a string option.  When the option is a
			comma separated list, a comma is added, unless the
			value was empty.
			Also see |:set-args| above.
			{not in Vi}

:se[t] {option}-={value}				*:set-=*
			Subtract the {value} from a number option, or remove
			the {value} from a string option, if it is there.
			If the {value} is not found in a string option, there
			is no error or warning.  When the option is a comma
			separated list, a comma is deleted, unless the option
			becomes empty.
			When the option is a list of flags, {value} must be
			exactly as they appear in the option.  Remove flags
			one by one to avoid problems.
			Also see |:set-args| above.
			{not in Vi}

The {option} arguments to ":set" may be repeated.  For example: >
	:set ai nosi sw=3 ts=3
If you make an error in one of the arguments, an error message will be given
and the following arguments will be ignored.

							*:set-verbose*
When 'verbose' is non-zero, displaying an option value will also tell where it
was last set.  Example: >
	:verbose set shiftwidth cindent?
<	  shiftwidth=4 ~
		  Last set from modeline ~
	  cindent ~
		  Last set from /usr/local/share/vim/vim60/ftplugin/c.vim ~
This is only done when specific option values are requested, not for ":verbose
set all" or ":verbose set" without an argument.
When the option was set by hand there is no "Last set" message.
When the option was set while executing a function, user command or
autocommand, the script in which it was defined is reported.
Note that an option may also have been set as a side effect of setting
'compatible'.
A few special texts:
	Last set from modeline ~
		Option was set in a |modeline|.
	Last set from --cmd argument ~
		Option was set with command line argument |--cmd| or +.
	Last set from -c argument ~
		Option was set with command line argument |-c|, +, |-S| or
		|-q|.
	Last set from environment variable ~
		Option was set from an environment variable, $VIMINIT,
		$GVIMINIT or $EXINIT.
	Last set from error handler ~
		Option was cleared when evaluating it resulted in an error.

{not available when compiled without the |+eval| feature}

							*:set-termcap* *E522*
For {option} the form "t_xx" may be used to set a terminal option.  This will
override the value from the termcap.  You can then use it in a mapping.  If
the "xx" part contains special characters, use the <t_xx> form: >
	:set <t_#4>=^[Ot
This can also be used to translate a special code for a normal key.  For
example, if Alt-b produces <Esc>b, use this: >
	:set <M-b>=^[b
(the ^[ is a real <Esc> here, use CTRL-V <Esc> to enter it)
The advantage over a mapping is that it works in all situations.

You can define any key codes, e.g.: >
	:set t_xy=^[foo;
There is no warning for using a name that isn't recognized.  You can map these
codes as you like: >
	:map <t_xy> something
<								*E846*
When a key code is not set, it's like it does not exist.  Trying to get its
value will result in an error: >
	:set t_kb=
	:set t_kb
	E846: Key code not set: t_kb

The t_xx options cannot be set from a |modeline| or in the |sandbox|, for
security reasons.

The listing from ":set" looks different from Vi.  Long string options are put
at the end of the list.  The number of options is quite large.  The output of
"set all" probably does not fit on the screen, causing Vim to give the
|more-prompt|.

							*option-backslash*
To include white space in a string option value it has to be preceded with a
backslash.  To include a backslash you have to use two.  Effectively this
means that the number of backslashes in an option value is halved (rounded
down).
A few examples: >
   :set tags=tags\ /usr/tags	    results in "tags /usr/tags"
   :set tags=tags\\,file	    results in "tags\,file"
   :set tags=tags\\\ file	    results in "tags\ file"

The "|" character separates a ":set" command from a following command.  To
include the "|" in the option value, use "\|" instead.  This example sets the
'titlestring' option to "hi|there": >
   :set titlestring=hi\|there
This sets the 'titlestring' option to "hi" and 'iconstring' to "there": >
   :set titlestring=hi|set iconstring=there

Similarly, the double quote character starts a comment.  To include the '"' in
the option value, use '\"' instead.  This example sets the 'titlestring'
option to 'hi "there"': >
   :set titlestring=hi\ \"there\"

For MS-DOS and WIN32 backslashes in file names are mostly not removed.  More
precise: For options that expect a file name (those where environment
variables are expanded) a backslash before a normal file name character is not
removed.  But a backslash before a special character (space, backslash, comma,
etc.) is used like explained above.
There is one special situation, when the value starts with "\\": >
   :set dir=\\machine\path	    results in "\\machine\path"
   :set dir=\\\\machine\\path	    results in "\\machine\path"
   :set dir=\\path\\file	    results in "\\path\file" (wrong!)
For the first one the start is kept, but for the second one the backslashes
are halved.  This makes sure it works both when you expect backslashes to be
halved and when you expect the backslashes to be kept.  The third gives a
result which is probably not what you want.  Avoid it.

				*add-option-flags* *remove-option-flags*
				*E539* *E550* *E551* *E552*
Some options are a list of flags.  When you want to add a flag to such an
option, without changing the existing ones, you can do it like this: >
   :set guioptions+=a
Remove a flag from an option like this: >
   :set guioptions-=a
This removes the 'a' flag from 'guioptions'.
Note that you should add or remove one flag at a time.  If 'guioptions' has
the value "ab", using "set guioptions-=ba" won't work, because the string "ba"
doesn't appear.

			   *:set_env* *expand-env* *expand-environment-var*
Environment variables in specific string options will be expanded.  If the
environment variable exists the '$' and the following environment variable
name is replaced with its value.  If it does not exist the '$' and the name
are not modified.  Any non-id character (not a letter, digit or '_') may
follow the environment variable name.  That character and what follows is
appended to the value of the environment variable.  Examples: >
   :set term=$TERM.new
   :set path=/usr/$INCLUDE,$HOME/include,.
When adding or removing a string from an option with ":set opt-=val" or ":set
opt+=val" the expansion is done before the adding or removing.


Handling of local options			*local-options*

Some of the options only apply to a window or buffer.  Each window or buffer
has its own copy of this option, thus can each have their own value.  This
allows you to set 'list' in one window but not in another.  And set
'shiftwidth' to 3 in one buffer and 4 in another.

The following explains what happens to these local options in specific
situations.  You don't really need to know all of this, since Vim mostly uses
the option values you would expect.  Unfortunately, doing what the user
expects is a bit complicated...

When splitting a window, the local options are copied to the new window.  Thus
right after the split the contents of the two windows look the same.

When editing a new buffer, its local option values must be initialized.  Since
the local options of the current buffer might be specifically for that buffer,
these are not used.  Instead, for each buffer-local option there also is a
global value, which is used for new buffers.  With ":set" both the local and
global value is changed.  With "setlocal" only the local value is changed,
thus this value is not used when editing a new buffer.

When editing a buffer that has been edited before, the last used window
options are used again.  If this buffer has been edited in this window, the
values from back then are used.  Otherwise the values from the window where
the buffer was edited last are used.

It's possible to set a local window option specifically for a type of buffer.
When you edit another buffer in the same window, you don't want to keep
using these local window options.  Therefore Vim keeps a global value of the
local window options, which is used when editing another buffer.  Each window
has its own copy of these values.  Thus these are local to the window, but
global to all buffers in the window.  With this you can do: >
	:e one
	:set list
	:e two
Now the 'list' option will also be set in "two", since with the ":set list"
command you have also set the global value. >
	:set nolist
	:e one
	:setlocal list
	:e two
Now the 'list' option is not set, because ":set nolist" resets the global
value, ":setlocal list" only changes the local value and ":e two" gets the
global value.  Note that if you do this next: >
	:e one
You will get back the 'list' value as it was the last time you edited "one".
The options local to a window are remembered for each buffer.  This also
happens when the buffer is not loaded, but they are lost when the buffer is
wiped out |:bwipe|.

							*:setl* *:setlocal*
:setl[ocal] ...		Like ":set" but set only the value local to the
			current buffer or window.  Not all options have a
			local value.  If the option does not have a local
			value the global value is set.
			With the "all" argument: display local values for all
			local options.
			Without argument: Display local values for all local
			options which are different from the default.
			When displaying a specific local option, show the
			local value.  For a global/local boolean option, when
			the global value is being used, "--" is displayed
			before the option name.
			For a global option the global value is
			shown (but that might change in the future).
			{not in Vi}

:setl[ocal] {option}<	Set the local value of {option} to its global value by
			copying the value.
			{not in Vi}

:se[t] {option}<	For |global-local| options: Remove the local value of
			{option}, so that the global value will be used.
			{not in Vi}

							*:setg* *:setglobal*
:setg[lobal] ...	Like ":set" but set only the global value for a local
			option without changing the local value.
			When displaying an option, the global value is shown.
			With the "all" argument: display global values for all
			local options.
			Without argument: display global values for all local
			options which are different from the default.
			{not in Vi}

For buffer-local and window-local options:
	Command		 global value	    local value ~
      :set option=value	     set		set
 :setlocal option=value	      -			set
:setglobal option=value	     set		 -
      :set option?	      -		       display
 :setlocal option?	      -		       display
:setglobal option?	    display		 -


Global options with a local value			*global-local*

Options are global when you mostly use one value for all buffers and windows.
For some global options it's useful to sometimes have a different local value.
You can set the local value with ":setlocal".  That buffer or window will then
use the local value, while other buffers and windows continue using the global
value.

For example, you have two windows, both on C source code.  They use the global
'makeprg' option.  If you do this in one of the two windows: >
	:set makeprg=gmake
then the other window will switch to the same value.  There is no need to set
the 'makeprg' option in the other C source window too.
However, if you start editing a Perl file in a new window, you want to use
another 'makeprg' for it, without changing the value used for the C source
files.  You use this command: >
	:setlocal makeprg=perlmake
You can switch back to using the global value by making the local value empty: >
	:setlocal makeprg=
This only works for a string option.  For a boolean option you need to use the
"<" flag, like this: >
	:setlocal autoread<
Note that for non-boolean options using "<" copies the global value to the
local value, it doesn't switch back to using the global value (that matters
when the global value changes later).  You can also use: >
	:set path<
This will make the local value of 'path' empty, so that the global value is
used.  Thus it does the same as: >
	:setlocal path=
Note: In the future more global options can be made global-local.  Using
":setlocal" on a global option might work differently then.


Setting the filetype

:setf[iletype] {filetype}			*:setf* *:setfiletype*
			Set the 'filetype' option to {filetype}, but only if
			not done yet in a sequence of (nested) autocommands.
			This is short for: >
				:if !did_filetype()
				:  setlocal filetype={filetype}
				:endif
<			This command is used in a filetype.vim file to avoid
			setting the 'filetype' option twice, causing different
			settings and syntax files to be loaded.
			{not in Vi}

				*option-window* *optwin*
:bro[wse] se[t]			*:set-browse* *:browse-set* *:opt* *:options*
:opt[ions]		Open a window for viewing and setting all options.
			Options are grouped by function.
			Offers short help for each option.  Hit <CR> on the
			short help to open a help window with more help for
			the option.
			Modify the value of the option and hit <CR> on the
			"set" line to set the new value.  For window and
			buffer specific options, the last accessed window is
			used to set the option value in, unless this is a help
			window, in which case the window below help window is
			used (skipping the option-window).
			{not available when compiled without the |+eval| or
			|+autocmd| features}

								*$HOME*
Using "~" is like using "$HOME", but it is only recognized at the start of an
option and after a space or comma.

On Unix systems "~user" can be used too.  It is replaced by the home directory
of user "user".  Example: >
    :set path=~mool/include,/usr/include,.

On Unix systems the form "${HOME}" can be used too.  The name between {} can
contain non-id characters then.  Note that if you want to use this for the
"gf" command, you need to add the '{' and '}' characters to 'isfname'.

On MS-Windows, if $HOME is not defined as an environment variable, then
at runtime Vim will set it to the expansion of $HOMEDRIVE$HOMEPATH.

NOTE: expanding environment variables and "~/" is only done with the ":set"
command, not when assigning a value to an option with ":let".


Note the maximum length of an expanded option is limited.  How much depends on
the system, mostly it is something like 256 or 1024 characters.

							*:fix* *:fixdel*
:fix[del]		Set the value of 't_kD':
				't_kb' is     't_kD' becomes	~
				  CTRL-?	CTRL-H
				not CTRL-?	CTRL-?

			(CTRL-? is 0177 octal, 0x7f hex) {not in Vi}

			If your delete key terminal code is wrong, but the
			code for backspace is alright, you can put this in
			your .vimrc: >
				:fixdel
<			This works no matter what the actual code for
			backspace is.

			If the backspace key terminal code is wrong you can
			use this: >
				:if &term == "termname"
				:  set t_kb=^V<BS>
				:  fixdel
				:endif
<			Where "^V" is CTRL-V and "<BS>" is the backspace key
			(don't type four characters!).  Replace "termname"
			with your terminal name.

			If your <Delete> key sends a strange key sequence (not
			CTRL-? or CTRL-H) you cannot use ":fixdel".  Then use: >
				:if &term == "termname"
				:  set t_kD=^V<Delete>
				:endif
<			Where "^V" is CTRL-V and "<Delete>" is the delete key
			(don't type eight characters!).  Replace "termname"
			with your terminal name.

							*Linux-backspace*
			Note about Linux: By default the backspace key
			produces CTRL-?, which is wrong.  You can fix it by
			putting this line in your rc.local: >
				echo "keycode 14 = BackSpace" | loadkeys
<
							*NetBSD-backspace*
			Note about NetBSD: If your backspace doesn't produce
			the right code, try this: >
				xmodmap -e "keycode 22 = BackSpace"
<			If this works, add this in your .Xmodmap file: >
				keysym 22 = BackSpace
<			You need to restart for this to take effect.

==============================================================================
2. Automatically setting options			*auto-setting*

Besides changing options with the ":set" command, there are three alternatives
to set options automatically for one or more files:

1. When starting Vim initializations are read from various places.  See
   |initialization|.  Most of them are performed for all editing sessions,
   and some of them depend on the directory where Vim is started.
   You can create an initialization file with |:mkvimrc|, |:mkview| and
   |:mksession|.
2. If you start editing a new file, the automatic commands are executed.
   This can be used to set options for files matching a particular pattern and
   many other things.  See |autocommand|.
3. If you start editing a new file, and the 'modeline' option is on, a
   number of lines at the beginning and end of the file are checked for
   modelines.  This is explained here.

					*modeline* *vim:* *vi:* *ex:* *E520*
There are two forms of modelines.  The first form:
	[text]{white}{vi:|vim:|ex:}[white]{options}

[text]			any text or empty
{white}			at least one blank character (<Space> or <Tab>)
{vi:|vim:|ex:}		the string "vi:", "vim:" or "ex:"
[white]			optional white space
{options}		a list of option settings, separated with white space
			or ':', where each part between ':' is the argument
			for a ":set" command (can be empty)

Examples:
   vi:noai:sw=3 ts=6 ~
   vim: tw=77 ~

The second form (this is compatible with some versions of Vi):

	[text]{white}{vi:|vim:|Vim:|ex:}[white]se[t] {options}:[text]

[text]			any text or empty
{white}			at least one blank character (<Space> or <Tab>)
{vi:|vim:|Vim:|ex:}	the string "vi:", "vim:", "Vim:" or "ex:"
[white]			optional white space
se[t]			the string "set " or "se " (note the space); When
			"Vim" is used it must be "set".
{options}		a list of options, separated with white space, which
			is the argument for a ":set" command
:			a colon
[text]			any text or empty

Examples:
   /* vim: set ai tw=75: */ ~
   /* Vim: set ai tw=75: */ ~

The white space before {vi:|vim:|Vim:|ex:} is required.  This minimizes the
chance that a normal word like "lex:" is caught.  There is one exception:
"vi:" and "vim:" can also be at the start of the line (for compatibility with
version 3.0).  Using "ex:" at the start of the line will be ignored (this
could be short for "example:").

							*modeline-local*
The options are set like with ":setlocal": The new value only applies to the
buffer and window that contain the file.  Although it's possible to set global
options from a modeline, this is unusual.  If you have two windows open and
the files in it set the same global option to a different value, the result
depends on which one was opened last.

When editing a file that was already loaded, only the window-local options
from the modeline are used.  Thus if you manually changed a buffer-local
option after opening the file, it won't be changed if you edit the same buffer
in another window.  But window-local options will be set.

							*modeline-version*
If the modeline is only to be used for some versions of Vim, the version
number can be specified where "vim:" or "Vim:" is used:
	vim{vers}:	version {vers} or later
	vim<{vers}:	version before {vers}
	vim={vers}:	version {vers}
	vim>{vers}:	version after {vers}
{vers} is 600 for Vim 6.0 (hundred times the major version plus minor).
For example, to use a modeline only for Vim 6.0 and later:
	/* vim600: set foldmethod=marker: */ ~
To use a modeline for Vim before version 5.7:
	/* vim<570: set sw=4: */ ~
There can be no blanks between "vim" and the ":".


The number of lines that are checked can be set with the 'modelines' option.
If 'modeline' is off or 'modelines' is 0 no lines are checked.

Note that for the first form all of the rest of the line is used, thus a line
like:
   /* vi:ts=4: */ ~
will give an error message for the trailing "*/".  This line is OK:
   /* vi:set ts=4: */ ~

If an error is detected the rest of the line is skipped.

If you want to include a ':' in a set command precede it with a '\'.  The
backslash in front of the ':' will be removed.  Example:
   /* vi:set dir=c\:\tmp: */ ~
This sets the 'dir' option to "c:\tmp".  Only a single backslash before the
':' is removed.  Thus to include "\:" you have to specify "\\:".

No other commands than "set" are supported, for security reasons (somebody
might create a Trojan horse text file with modelines).  And not all options
can be set.  For some options a flag is set, so that when it's used the
|sandbox| is effective.  Still, there is always a small risk that a modeline
causes trouble.  E.g., when some joker sets 'textwidth' to 5 all your lines
are wrapped unexpectedly.  So disable modelines before editing untrusted text.
The mail ftplugin does this, for example.

Hint: If you would like to do something else than setting an option, you could
define an autocommand that checks the file for a specific string.  For
example: >
	au BufReadPost * if getline(1) =~ "VAR" | call SetVar() | endif
And define a function SetVar() that does something with the line containing
"VAR".

==============================================================================
3. Options summary					*option-summary*

In the list below all the options are mentioned with their full name and with
an abbreviation if there is one.  Both forms may be used.

In this document when a boolean option is "set" that means that ":set option"
is entered.  When an option is "reset", ":set nooption" is used.

For some options there are two default values: The "Vim default", which is
used when 'compatible' is not set, and the "Vi default", which is used when
'compatible' is set.

Most options are the same in all windows and buffers.  There are a few that
are specific to how the text is presented in a window.  These can be set to a
different value in each window.  For example the 'list' option can be set in
one window and reset in another for the same text, giving both types of view
at the same time.  There are a few options that are specific to a certain
file.  These can have a different value for each file or buffer.  For example
the 'textwidth' option can be 78 for a normal text file and 0 for a C
program.

	global			one option for all buffers and windows
	local to window		each window has its own copy of this option
	local to buffer		each buffer has its own copy of this option

When creating a new window the option values from the currently active window
are used as a default value for the window-specific options.  For the
buffer-specific options this depends on the 's' and 'S' flags in the
'cpoptions' option.  If 's' is included (which is the default) the values for
buffer options are copied from the currently active buffer when a buffer is
first entered.  If 'S' is present the options are copied each time the buffer
is entered, this is almost like having global options.  If 's' and 'S' are not
present, the options are copied from the currently active buffer when the
buffer is created.

Hidden options						*hidden-options*

Not all options are supported in all versions.  This depends on the supported
features and sometimes on the system.  A remark about this is in curly braces
below.  When an option is not supported it may still be set without getting an
error, this is called a hidden option.  You can't get the value of a hidden
option though, it is not stored.

To test if option "foo" can be used with ":set" use something like this: >
	if exists('&foo')
This also returns true for a hidden option.  To test if option "foo" is really
supported use something like this: >
	if exists('+foo')
<
							*E355*
A jump table for the options with a short description can be found at |Q_op|.

					*'aleph'* *'al'* *aleph* *Aleph*
'aleph' 'al'		number	(default 128 for MS-DOS, 224 otherwise)
			global
			{not in Vi}
			{only available when compiled with the |+rightleft|
			feature}
	The ASCII code for the first letter of the Hebrew alphabet.  The
	routine that maps the keyboard in Hebrew mode, both in Insert mode
	(when hkmap is set) and on the command-line (when hitting CTRL-_)
	outputs the Hebrew characters in the range [aleph..aleph+26].
	aleph=128 applies to PC code, and aleph=224 applies to ISO 8859-8.
	See |rileft.txt|.

			*'allowrevins'* *'ari'* *'noallowrevins'* *'noari'*
'allowrevins' 'ari'	boolean	(default off)
			global
			{not in Vi}
			{only available when compiled with the |+rightleft|
			feature}
	Allow CTRL-_ in Insert and Command-line mode.  This is default off, to
	avoid that users that accidentally type CTRL-_ instead of SHIFT-_ get
	into reverse Insert mode, and don't know how to get out.  See
	'revins'.
	NOTE: This option is reset when 'compatible' is set.

			 *'altkeymap'* *'akm'* *'noaltkeymap'* *'noakm'*
'altkeymap' 'akm'	boolean (default off)
			global
			{not in Vi}
			{only available when compiled with the |+farsi|
			feature}
	When on, the second language is Farsi.  In editing mode CTRL-_ toggles
	the keyboard map between Farsi and English, when 'allowrevins' set.

	When off, the keyboard map toggles between Hebrew and English.  This
	is useful to start the Vim in native mode i.e. English (left-to-right
	mode) and have default second language Farsi or Hebrew (right-to-left
	mode).  See |farsi.txt|.

						*'ambiwidth'* *'ambw'*
'ambiwidth' 'ambw'	string (default: "single")
			global
			{not in Vi}
			{only available when compiled with the |+multi_byte|
			feature}
	Only effective when 'encoding' is "utf-8" or another Unicode encoding.
	Tells Vim what to do with characters with East Asian Width Class
	Ambiguous (such as Euro, Registered Sign, Copyright Sign, Greek
	letters, Cyrillic letters).

	There are currently two possible values:
	"single":	Use the same width as characters in US-ASCII.  This is
			expected by most users.
	"double":	Use twice the width of ASCII characters.
							*E834* *E835*
	The value "double" cannot be used if 'listchars' or 'fillchars'
	contains a character that would be double width.

	There are a number of CJK fonts for which the width of glyphs for
	those characters are solely based on how many octets they take in
	legacy/traditional CJK encodings.  In those encodings, Euro,
	Registered sign, Greek/Cyrillic letters are represented by two octets,
	therefore those fonts have "wide" glyphs for them.  This is also
	true of some line drawing characters used to make tables in text
	file.  Therefore, when a CJK font is used for GUI Vim or
	Vim is running inside a terminal (emulators) that uses a CJK font
	(or Vim is run inside an xterm invoked with "-cjkwidth" option.),
	this option should be set to "double" to match the width perceived
	by Vim with the width of glyphs in the font.  Perhaps it also has
	to be set to "double" under CJK Windows 9x/ME or Windows 2k/XP
	when the system locale is set to one of CJK locales.  See Unicode
	Standard Annex #11 (http://www.unicode.org/reports/tr11).

	Vim may set this option automatically at startup time when Vim is
	compiled with the |+termresponse| feature and if |t_u7| is set to the
	escape sequence to request cursor position report.

			*'antialias'* *'anti'* *'noantialias'* *'noanti'*
'antialias' 'anti'	boolean (default: off)
			global
			{not in Vi}
			{only available when compiled with GUI enabled
			on Mac OS X}
	This option only has an effect in the GUI version of Vim on Mac OS X
	v10.2 or later.  When on, Vim will use smooth ("antialiased") fonts,
	which can be easier to read at certain sizes on certain displays.
	Setting this option can sometimes cause problems if 'guifont' is set
	to its default (empty string).

			*'autochdir'* *'acd'* *'noautochdir'* *'noacd'*
'autochdir' 'acd'	boolean (default off)
			global
			{not in Vi}
			{only available when compiled with it, use
			exists("+autochdir") to check}
	When on, Vim will change the current working directory whenever you
	open a file, switch buffers, delete a buffer or open/close a window.
	It will change to the directory containing the file which was opened
	or selected.
	This option is provided for backward compatibility with the Vim
	released with Sun ONE Studio 4 Enterprise Edition.
	Note: When this option is on some plugins may not work.

				*'arabic'* *'arab'* *'noarabic'* *'noarab'*
'arabic' 'arab'		boolean (default off)
			local to window
			{not in Vi}
			{only available when compiled with the |+arabic|
			feature}
	This option can be set to start editing Arabic text.
	Setting this option will:
	- Set the 'rightleft' option, unless 'termbidi' is set.
	- Set the 'arabicshape' option, unless 'termbidi' is set.
	- Set the 'keymap' option to "arabic"; in Insert mode CTRL-^ toggles
	  between typing English and Arabic key mapping.
	- Set the 'delcombine' option
	Note that 'encoding' must be "utf-8" for working with Arabic text.

	Resetting this option will:
	- Reset the 'rightleft' option.
	- Disable the use of 'keymap' (without changing its value).
	Note that 'arabicshape' and 'delcombine' are not reset (it is a global
	option).
	Also see |arabic.txt|.

					*'arabicshape'* *'arshape'*
					*'noarabicshape'* *'noarshape'*
'arabicshape' 'arshape'	boolean (default on)
			global
			{not in Vi}
			{only available when compiled with the |+arabic|
			feature}
	When on and 'termbidi' is off, the required visual character
	corrections that need to take place for displaying the Arabic language
	take effect.  Shaping, in essence, gets enabled; the term is a broad
	one which encompasses:
	  a) the changing/morphing of characters based on their location
	     within a word (initial, medial, final and stand-alone).
	  b) the enabling of the ability to compose characters
	  c) the enabling of the required combining of some characters
	When disabled the display shows each character's true stand-alone
	form.
	Arabic is a complex language which requires other settings, for
	further details see |arabic.txt|.

			*'autoindent'* *'ai'* *'noautoindent'* *'noai'*
'autoindent' 'ai'	boolean	(default off)
			local to buffer
	Copy indent from current line when starting a new line (typing <CR>
	in Insert mode or when using the "o" or "O" command).  If you do not
	type anything on the new line except <BS> or CTRL-D and then type
	<Esc>, CTRL-O or <CR>, the indent is deleted again.  Moving the cursor
	to another line has the same effect, unless the 'I' flag is included
	in 'cpoptions'.
	When autoindent is on, formatting (with the "gq" command or when you
	reach 'textwidth' in Insert mode) uses the indentation of the first
	line.
	When 'smartindent' or 'cindent' is on the indent is changed in
	a different way.
	The 'autoindent' option is reset when the 'paste' option is set.
	{small difference from Vi: After the indent is deleted when typing
	<Esc> or <CR>, the cursor position when moving up or down is after the
	deleted indent; Vi puts the cursor somewhere in the deleted indent}.

				 *'autoread'* *'ar'* *'noautoread'* *'noar'*
'autoread' 'ar'		boolean	(default off)
			global or local to buffer |global-local|
			{not in Vi}
	When a file has been detected to have been changed outside of Vim and
	it has not been changed inside of Vim, automatically read it again.
	When the file has been deleted this is not done.  |timestamp|
	If this option has a local value, use this command to switch back to
	using the global value: >
		:set autoread<
<
				 *'autowrite'* *'aw'* *'noautowrite'* *'noaw'*
'autowrite' 'aw'	boolean	(default off)
			global
	Write the contents of the file, if it has been modified, on each
	:next, :rewind, :last, :first, :previous, :stop, :suspend, :tag, :!,
	:make, CTRL-] and CTRL-^ command; and when a :buffer, CTRL-O, CTRL-I,
	'{A-Z0-9}, or `{A-Z0-9} command takes one to another file.
	Note that for some commands the 'autowrite' option is not used, see
	'autowriteall' for that.

			 *'autowriteall'* *'awa'* *'noautowriteall'* *'noawa'*
'autowriteall' 'awa'	boolean	(default off)
			global
			{not in Vi}
	Like 'autowrite', but also used for commands ":edit", ":enew", ":quit",
	":qall", ":exit", ":xit", ":recover" and closing the Vim window.
	Setting this option also implies that Vim behaves like 'autowrite' has
	been set.

							*'background'* *'bg'*
'background' 'bg'	string	(default "dark" or "light", see below)
			global
			{not in Vi}
	When set to "dark", Vim will try to use colors that look good on a
	dark background.  When set to "light", Vim will try to use colors that
	look good on a light background.  Any other value is illegal.
	Vim tries to set the default value according to the terminal used.
	This will not always be correct.
	Setting this option does not change the background color, it tells Vim
	what the background color looks like.  For changing the background
	color, see |:hi-normal|.

	When 'background' is set Vim will adjust the default color groups for
	the new value.  But the colors used for syntax highlighting will not
	change.					*g:colors_name*
	When a color scheme is loaded (the "g:colors_name" variable is set)
	setting 'background' will cause the color scheme to be reloaded.  If
	the color scheme adjusts to the value of 'background' this will work.
	However, if the color scheme sets 'background' itself the effect may
	be undone.  First delete the "g:colors_name" variable when needed.

	When setting 'background' to the default value with: >
		:set background&
<	Vim will guess the value.  In the GUI this should work correctly,
	in other cases Vim might not be able to guess the right value.

	When starting the GUI, the default value for 'background' will be
	"light".  When the value is not set in the .gvimrc, and Vim detects
	that the background is actually quite dark, 'background' is set to
	"dark".  But this happens only AFTER the .gvimrc file has been read
	(because the window needs to be opened to find the actual background
	color).  To get around this, force the GUI window to be opened by
	putting a ":gui" command in the .gvimrc file, before where the value
	of 'background' is used (e.g., before ":syntax on").

	For MS-DOS, Windows and OS/2 the default is "dark".
	For other systems "dark" is used when 'term' is "linux",
	"screen.linux", "cygwin" or "putty", or $COLORFGBG suggests a dark
	background.  Otherwise the default is "light".

	Normally this option would be set in the .vimrc file.  Possibly
	depending on the terminal name.  Example: >
		:if &term == "pcterm"
		:  set background=dark
		:endif
<	When this option is set, the default settings for the highlight groups
	will change.  To use other settings, place ":highlight" commands AFTER
	the setting of the 'background' option.
	This option is also used in the "$VIMRUNTIME/syntax/syntax.vim" file
	to select the colors for syntax highlighting.  After changing this
	option, you must load syntax.vim again to see the result.  This can be
	done with ":syntax on".

							*'backspace'* *'bs'*
'backspace' 'bs'	string	(default "")
			global
			{not in Vi}
	Influences the working of <BS>, <Del>, CTRL-W and CTRL-U in Insert
	mode.  This is a list of items, separated by commas.  Each item allows
	a way to backspace over something:
	value	effect	~
	indent	allow backspacing over autoindent
	eol	allow backspacing over line breaks (join lines)
	start	allow backspacing over the start of insert; CTRL-W and CTRL-U
		stop once at the start of insert.

	When the value is empty, Vi compatible backspacing is used.

	For backwards compatibility with version 5.4 and earlier:
	value	effect	~
	  0	same as ":set backspace=" (Vi compatible)
	  1	same as ":set backspace=indent,eol"
	  2	same as ":set backspace=indent,eol,start"

	See |:fixdel| if your <BS> or <Del> key does not do what you want.
	NOTE: This option is set to "" when 'compatible' is set.

				*'backup'* *'bk'* *'nobackup'* *'nobk'*
'backup' 'bk'		boolean	(default off)
			global
			{not in Vi}
	Make a backup before overwriting a file.  Leave it around after the
	file has been successfully written.  If you do not want to keep the
	backup file, but you do want a backup while the file is being
	written, reset this option and set the 'writebackup' option (this is
	the default).  If you do not want a backup file at all reset both
	options (use this if your file system is almost full).  See the
	|backup-table| for more explanations.
	When the 'backupskip' pattern matches, a backup is not made anyway.
	When 'patchmode' is set, the backup may be renamed to become the
	oldest version of a file.
	NOTE: This option is reset when 'compatible' is set.

						*'backupcopy'* *'bkc'*
'backupcopy' 'bkc'	string	(Vi default for Unix: "yes", otherwise: "auto")
			global or local to buffer |global-local|
			{not in Vi}
	When writing a file and a backup is made, this option tells how it's
	done.  This is a comma separated list of words.

	The main values are:
	"yes"	make a copy of the file and overwrite the original one
	"no"	rename the file and write a new one
	"auto"	one of the previous, what works best

	Extra values that can be combined with the ones above are:
	"breaksymlink"	always break symlinks when writing
	"breakhardlink"	always break hardlinks when writing

	Making a copy and overwriting the original file:
	- Takes extra time to copy the file.
	+ When the file has special attributes, is a (hard/symbolic) link or
	  has a resource fork, all this is preserved.
	- When the file is a link the backup will have the name of the link,
	  not of the real file.

	Renaming the file and writing a new one:
	+ It's fast.
	- Sometimes not all attributes of the file can be copied to the new
	  file.
	- When the file is a link the new file will not be a link.

	The "auto" value is the middle way: When Vim sees that renaming file
	is possible without side effects (the attributes can be passed on and
	the file is not a link) that is used.  When problems are expected, a
	copy will be made.

	The "breaksymlink" and "breakhardlink" values can be used in
	combination with any of "yes", "no" and "auto".  When included, they
	force Vim to always break either symbolic or hard links by doing
	exactly what the "no" option does, renaming the original file to
	become the backup and writing a new file in its place.  This can be
	useful for example in source trees where all the files are symbolic or
	hard links and any changes should stay in the local source tree, not
	be propagated back to the original source.
							*crontab*
	One situation where "no" and "auto" will cause problems: A program
	that opens a file, invokes Vim to edit that file, and then tests if
	the open file was changed (through the file descriptor) will check the
	backup file instead of the newly created file.  "crontab -e" is an
	example.

	When a copy is made, the original file is truncated and then filled
	with the new text.  This means that protection bits, owner and
	symbolic links of the original file are unmodified.  The backup file
	however, is a new file, owned by the user who edited the file.  The
	group of the backup is set to the group of the original file.  If this
	fails, the protection bits for the group are made the same as for
	others.

	When the file is renamed this is the other way around: The backup has
	the same attributes of the original file, and the newly written file
	is owned by the current user.  When the file was a (hard/symbolic)
	link, the new file will not!  That's why the "auto" value doesn't
	rename when the file is a link.  The owner and group of the newly
	written file will be set to the same ones as the original file, but
	the system may refuse to do this.  In that case the "auto" value will
	again not rename the file.

						*'backupdir'* *'bdir'*
'backupdir' 'bdir'	string	(default for Amiga: ".,t:",
				 for MS-DOS and Win32: ".,$TEMP,c:/tmp,c:/temp"
				 for Unix: ".,~/tmp,~/")
			global
			{not in Vi}
	List of directories for the backup file, separated with commas.
	- The backup file will be created in the first directory in the list
	  where this is possible.  The directory must exist, Vim will not
	  create it for you.
	- Empty means that no backup file will be created ( 'patchmode' is
	  impossible!).  Writing may fail because of this.
	- A directory "." means to put the backup file in the same directory
	  as the edited file.
	- A directory starting with "./" (or ".\" for MS-DOS et al.) means to
	  put the backup file relative to where the edited file is.  The
	  leading "." is replaced with the path name of the edited file.
	  ("." inside a directory name has no special meaning).
	- Spaces after the comma are ignored, other spaces are considered part
	  of the directory name.  To have a space at the start of a directory
	  name, precede it with a backslash.
	- To include a comma in a directory name precede it with a backslash.
	- A directory name may end in an '/'.
	- Environment variables are expanded |:set_env|.
	- Careful with '\' characters, type one before a space, type two to
	  get one in the option (see |option-backslash|), for example: >
	    :set bdir=c:\\tmp,\ dir\\,with\\,commas,\\\ dir\ with\ spaces
<	- For backwards compatibility with Vim version 3.0 a '>' at the start
	  of the option is removed.
	See also 'backup' and 'writebackup' options.
	If you want to hide your backup files on Unix, consider this value: >
		:set backupdir=./.backup,~/.backup,.,/tmp
<	You must create a ".backup" directory in each directory and in your
	home directory for this to work properly.
	The use of |:set+=| and |:set-=| is preferred when adding or removing
	directories from the list.  This avoids problems when a future version
	uses another default.
	This option cannot be set from a |modeline| or in the |sandbox|, for
	security reasons.

						*'backupext'* *'bex'* *E589*
'backupext' 'bex'	string	(default "~", for VMS: "_")
			global
			{not in Vi}
	String which is appended to a file name to make the name of the
	backup file.  The default is quite unusual, because this avoids
	accidentally overwriting existing files with a backup file.  You might
	prefer using ".bak", but make sure that you don't have files with
	".bak" that you want to keep.
	Only normal file name characters can be used, "/\*?[|<>" are illegal.

	If you like to keep a lot of backups, you could use a BufWritePre
	autocommand to change 'backupext' just before writing the file to
	include a timestamp. >
		:au BufWritePre * let &bex = '-' . strftime("%Y%b%d%X") . '~'
<	Use 'backupdir' to put the backup in a different directory.

						*'backupskip'* *'bsk'*
'backupskip' 'bsk'	string	(default: "/tmp/*,$TMPDIR/*,$TMP/*,$TEMP/*")
			global
			{not in Vi}
			{not available when compiled without the |+wildignore|
			feature}
	A list of file patterns.  When one of the patterns matches with the
	name of the file which is written, no backup file is created.  Both
	the specified file name and the full path name of the file are used.
	The pattern is used like with |:autocmd|, see |autocmd-patterns|.
	Watch out for special characters, see |option-backslash|.
	When $TMPDIR, $TMP or $TEMP is not defined, it is not used for the
	default value.  "/tmp/*" is only used for Unix.

	WARNING: Not having a backup file means that when Vim fails to write
	your buffer correctly and then, for whatever reason, Vim exits, you
	lose both the original file and what you were writing.  Only disable
	backups if you don't care about losing the file.

	Note that environment variables are not expanded.  If you want to use
	$HOME you must expand it explicitly, e.g.: >
		:let backupskip = escape(expand('$HOME'), '\') . '/tmp/*'

<	Note that the default also makes sure that "crontab -e" works (when a
	backup would be made by renaming the original file crontab won't see
	the newly created file).  Also see 'backupcopy' and |crontab|.

						*'balloondelay'* *'bdlay'*
'balloondelay' 'bdlay'	number	(default: 600)
			global
			{not in Vi}
			{only available when compiled with the |+balloon_eval|
			feature}
	Delay in milliseconds before a balloon may pop up.  See |balloon-eval|.

		       *'ballooneval'* *'beval'* *'noballooneval'* *'nobeval'*
'ballooneval' 'beval'	boolean	(default off)
			global
			{not in Vi}
			{only available when compiled with the |+balloon_eval|
			feature}
	Switch on the |balloon-eval| functionality.

						     *'balloonexpr'* *'bexpr'*
'balloonexpr' 'bexpr'	string	(default "")
			global or local to buffer |global-local|
			{not in Vi}
			{only available when compiled with the |+balloon_eval|
			feature}
	Expression for text to show in evaluation balloon.  It is only used
	when 'ballooneval' is on.  These variables can be used:

	v:beval_bufnr	number of the buffer in which balloon is going to show
	v:beval_winnr	number of the window
	v:beval_lnum	line number
	v:beval_col	column number (byte index)
	v:beval_text	word under or after the mouse pointer

	The evaluation of the expression must not have side effects!
	Example: >
    function! MyBalloonExpr()
	return 'Cursor is at line ' . v:beval_lnum .
		\', column ' . v:beval_col .
		\ ' of file ' .  bufname(v:beval_bufnr) .
		\ ' on word "' . v:beval_text . '"'
    endfunction
    set bexpr=MyBalloonExpr()
    set ballooneval
<
	NOTE: The balloon is displayed only if the cursor is on a text
	character.  If the result of evaluating 'balloonexpr' is not empty,
	Vim does not try to send a message to an external debugger (Netbeans
	or Sun Workshop).

	The expression will be evaluated in the |sandbox| when set from a
	modeline, see |sandbox-option|.

	It is not allowed to change text or jump to another window while
	evaluating 'balloonexpr' |textlock|.

	To check whether line breaks in the balloon text work use this check: >
		if has("balloon_multiline")
<	When they are supported "\n" characters will start a new line.  If the
	expression evaluates to a |List| this is equal to using each List item
	as a string and putting "\n" in between them.

				     *'binary'* *'bin'* *'nobinary'* *'nobin'*
'binary' 'bin'		boolean	(default off)
			local to buffer
			{not in Vi}
	This option should be set before editing a binary file.  You can also
	use the |-b| Vim argument.  When this option is switched on a few
	options will be changed (also when it already was on):
		'textwidth'  will be set to 0
		'wrapmargin' will be set to 0
		'modeline'   will be off
		'expandtab'  will be off
	Also, 'fileformat' and 'fileformats' options will not be used, the
	file is read and written like 'fileformat' was "unix" (a single <NL>
	separates lines).
	The 'fileencoding' and 'fileencodings' options will not be used, the
	file is read without conversion.
	NOTE: When you start editing a(nother) file while the 'bin' option is
	on, settings from autocommands may change the settings again (e.g.,
	'textwidth'), causing trouble when editing.  You might want to set
	'bin' again when the file has been loaded.
	The previous values of these options are remembered and restored when
	'bin' is switched from on to off.  Each buffer has its own set of
	saved option values.
	To edit a file with 'binary' set you can use the |++bin| argument.
	This avoids you have to do ":set bin", which would have effect for all
	files you edit.
	When writing a file the <EOL> for the last line is only written if
	there was one in the original file (normally Vim appends an <EOL> to
	the last line if there is none; this would make the file longer).  See
	the 'endofline' option.

			*'bioskey'* *'biosk'* *'nobioskey'* *'nobiosk'*
'bioskey' 'biosk'	boolean	(default on)
			global
			{not in Vi}  {only for MS-DOS}
	When on the BIOS is called to obtain a keyboard character.  This works
	better to detect CTRL-C, but only works for the console.  When using a
	terminal over a serial port reset this option.
	Also see |'conskey'|.

							*'bomb'* *'nobomb'*
'bomb'			boolean	(default off)
			local to buffer
			{not in Vi}
			{only available when compiled with the |+multi_byte|
			feature}
	When writing a file and the following conditions are met, a BOM (Byte
	Order Mark) is prepended to the file:
	- this option is on
	- the 'binary' option is off
	- 'fileencoding' is "utf-8", "ucs-2", "ucs-4" or one of the little/big
	  endian variants.
	Some applications use the BOM to recognize the encoding of the file.
	Often used for UCS-2 files on MS-Windows.  For other applications it
	causes trouble, for example: "cat file1 file2" makes the BOM of file2
	appear halfway the resulting file.  Gcc doesn't accept a BOM.
	When Vim reads a file and 'fileencodings' starts with "ucs-bom", a
	check for the presence of the BOM is done and 'bomb' set accordingly.
	Unless 'binary' is set, it is removed from the first line, so that you
	don't see it when editing.  When you don't change the options, the BOM
	will be restored when writing the file.

						*'breakat'* *'brk'*
'breakat' 'brk'		string	(default " ^I!@*-+;:,./?")
			global
			{not in Vi}
			{not available when compiled without the |+linebreak|
			feature}
	This option lets you choose which characters might cause a line
	break if 'linebreak' is on.  Only works for ASCII and also for 8-bit
	characters when 'encoding' is an 8-bit encoding.

						*'breakindent'* *'bri'*
'breakindent' 'bri'	boolean (default off)
			local to window
			{not in Vi}
			{not available when compiled without the |+linebreak|
			feature}
	Every wrapped line will continue visually indented (same amount of
	space as the beginning of that line), thus preserving horizontal blocks
	of text.

						*'breakindentopt'* *'briopt'*
'breakindentopt' 'briopt' string (default empty)
			local to window
			{not in Vi}
			{not available when compiled without the |+linebreak|
			feature}
	Settings for 'breakindent'. It can consist of the following optional
	items and must be separated by a comma:
		min:{n}	    Minimum text width that will be kept after
			    applying 'breakindent', even if the resulting
			    text should normally be narrower. This prevents
			    text indented almost to the right window border
			    occupying lot of vertical space when broken.
		shift:{n}   After applying 'breakindent', the wrapped line's
			    beginning will be shifted by the given number of
			    characters.  It permits dynamic French paragraph
			    indentation (negative) or emphasizing the line
			    continuation (positive).
		sbr	    Display the 'showbreak' value before applying the 
			    additional indent.
	The default value for min is 20 and shift is 0.

						*'browsedir'* *'bsdir'*
'browsedir' 'bsdir'	string	(default: "last")
			global
			{not in Vi} {only for Motif, Athena, GTK, Mac and
			Win32 GUI}
	Which directory to use for the file browser:
	   last		Use same directory as with last file browser, where a
			file was opened or saved.
	   buffer	Use the directory of the related buffer.
	   current	Use the current directory.
	   {path}	Use the specified directory

						*'bufhidden'* *'bh'*
'bufhidden' 'bh'	string (default: "")
			local to buffer
			{not in Vi}
			{not available when compiled without the |+quickfix|
			feature}
	This option specifies what happens when a buffer is no longer
	displayed in a window:
	  <empty>	follow the global 'hidden' option
	  hide		hide the buffer (don't unload it), also when 'hidden'
			is not set
	  unload	unload the buffer, also when 'hidden' is set or using
			|:hide|
	  delete	delete the buffer from the buffer list, also when
			'hidden' is set or using |:hide|, like using
			|:bdelete|
	  wipe		wipe out the buffer from the buffer list, also when
			'hidden' is set or using |:hide|, like using
			|:bwipeout|

	CAREFUL: when "unload", "delete" or "wipe" is used changes in a buffer
	are lost without a warning.  Also, these values may break autocommands
	that switch between buffers temporarily.
	This option is used together with 'buftype' and 'swapfile' to specify
	special kinds of buffers.   See |special-buffers|.

			*'buflisted'* *'bl'* *'nobuflisted'* *'nobl'* *E85*
'buflisted' 'bl'	boolean (default: on)
			local to buffer
			{not in Vi}
	When this option is set, the buffer shows up in the buffer list.  If
	it is reset it is not used for ":bnext", "ls", the Buffers menu, etc.
	This option is reset by Vim for buffers that are only used to remember
	a file name or marks.  Vim sets it when starting to edit a buffer.
	But not when moving to a buffer with ":buffer".

						*'buftype'* *'bt'* *E382*
'buftype' 'bt'		string (default: "")
			local to buffer
			{not in Vi}
			{not available when compiled without the |+quickfix|
			feature}
	The value of this option specifies the type of a buffer:
	  <empty>	normal buffer
	  nofile	buffer which is not related to a file and will not be
			written
	  nowrite	buffer which will not be written
	  acwrite	buffer which will always be written with BufWriteCmd
			autocommands. {not available when compiled without the
			|+autocmd| feature}
	  quickfix	quickfix buffer, contains list of errors |:cwindow|
			or list of locations |:lwindow|
	  help		help buffer (you are not supposed to set this
			manually)

	This option is used together with 'bufhidden' and 'swapfile' to
	specify special kinds of buffers.   See |special-buffers|.

	Be careful with changing this option, it can have many side effects!

	A "quickfix" buffer is only used for the error list and the location
	list.  This value is set by the |:cwindow| and |:lwindow| commands and
	you are not supposed to change it.

	"nofile" and "nowrite" buffers are similar:
	both:		The buffer is not to be written to disk, ":w" doesn't
			work (":w filename" does work though).
	both:		The buffer is never considered to be |'modified'|.
			There is no warning when the changes will be lost, for
			example when you quit Vim.
	both:		A swap file is only created when using too much memory
			(when 'swapfile' has been reset there is never a swap
			file).
	nofile only:	The buffer name is fixed, it is not handled like a
			file name.  It is not modified in response to a |:cd|
			command.
							*E676*
	"acwrite" implies that the buffer name is not related to a file, like
	"nofile", but it will be written.  Thus, in contrast to "nofile" and
	"nowrite", ":w" does work and a modified buffer can't be abandoned
	without saving.  For writing there must be matching |BufWriteCmd|,
	|FileWriteCmd| or |FileAppendCmd| autocommands.

						*'casemap'* *'cmp'*
'casemap' 'cmp'		string	(default: "internal,keepascii")
			global
			{not in Vi}
			{only available when compiled with the |+multi_byte|
			feature}
	Specifies details about changing the case of letters.  It may contain
	these words, separated by a comma:
	internal	Use internal case mapping functions, the current
			locale does not change the case mapping.  This only
			matters when 'encoding' is a Unicode encoding,
			"latin1" or "iso-8859-15".  When "internal" is
			omitted, the towupper() and towlower() system library
			functions are used when available.
	keepascii	For the ASCII characters (0x00 to 0x7f) use the US
			case mapping, the current locale is not effective.
			This probably only matters for Turkish.

						*'cdpath'* *'cd'* *E344* *E346*
'cdpath' 'cd'		string	(default: equivalent to $CDPATH or ",,")
			global
			{not in Vi}
			{not available when compiled without the
			|+file_in_path| feature}
	This is a list of directories which will be searched when using the
	|:cd| and |:lcd| commands, provided that the directory being searched
	for has a relative path, not an absolute part starting with "/", "./"
	or "../", the 'cdpath' option is not used then.
	The 'cdpath' option's value has the same form and semantics as
	|'path'|.  Also see |file-searching|.
	The default value is taken from $CDPATH, with a "," prepended to look
	in the current directory first.
	If the default value taken from $CDPATH is not what you want, include
	a modified version of the following command in your vimrc file to
	override it: >
	  :let &cdpath = ',' . substitute(substitute($CDPATH, '[, ]', '\\\0', 'g'), ':', ',', 'g')
<	This option cannot be set from a |modeline| or in the |sandbox|, for
	security reasons.
	(parts of 'cdpath' can be passed to the shell to expand file names).

						*'cedit'*
'cedit'			string	(Vi default: "", Vim default: CTRL-F)
			global
			{not in Vi}
			{not available when compiled without the |+vertsplit|
			feature}
	The key used in Command-line Mode to open the command-line window.
	The default is CTRL-F when 'compatible' is off.
	Only non-printable keys are allowed.
	The key can be specified as a single character, but it is difficult to
	type.  The preferred way is to use the <> notation.  Examples: >
		:set cedit=<C-Y>
		:set cedit=<Esc>
<	|Nvi| also has this option, but it only uses the first character.
	See |cmdwin|.

				*'charconvert'* *'ccv'* *E202* *E214* *E513*
'charconvert' 'ccv'	string (default "")
			global
			{only available when compiled with the |+multi_byte|
			and |+eval| features}
			{not in Vi}
	An expression that is used for character encoding conversion.  It is
	evaluated when a file that is to be read or has been written has a
	different encoding from what is desired.
	'charconvert' is not used when the internal iconv() function is
	supported and is able to do the conversion.  Using iconv() is
	preferred, because it is much faster.
	'charconvert' is not used when reading stdin |--|, because there is no
	file to convert from.  You will have to save the text in a file first.
	The expression must return zero or an empty string for success,
	non-zero for failure.
	The possible encoding names encountered are in 'encoding'.
	Additionally, names given in 'fileencodings' and 'fileencoding' are
	used.
	Conversion between "latin1", "unicode", "ucs-2", "ucs-4" and "utf-8"
	is done internally by Vim, 'charconvert' is not used for this.
	'charconvert' is also used to convert the viminfo file, if the 'c'
	flag is present in 'viminfo'.  Also used for Unicode conversion.
	Example: >
		set charconvert=CharConvert()
		fun CharConvert()
		  system("recode "
			\ . v:charconvert_from . ".." . v:charconvert_to
			\ . " <" . v:fname_in . " >" v:fname_out)
		  return v:shell_error
		endfun
<	The related Vim variables are:
		v:charconvert_from	name of the current encoding
		v:charconvert_to	name of the desired encoding
		v:fname_in		name of the input file
		v:fname_out		name of the output file
	Note that v:fname_in and v:fname_out will never be the same.
	Note that v:charconvert_from and v:charconvert_to may be different
	from 'encoding'.  Vim internally uses UTF-8 instead of UCS-2 or UCS-4.
	Encryption is not done by Vim when using 'charconvert'.  If you want
	to encrypt the file after conversion, 'charconvert' should take care
	of this.
	This option cannot be set from a |modeline| or in the |sandbox|, for
	security reasons.

				   *'cindent'* *'cin'* *'nocindent'* *'nocin'*
'cindent' 'cin'		boolean	(default off)
			local to buffer
			{not in Vi}
			{not available when compiled without the |+cindent|
			feature}
	Enables automatic C program indenting.  See 'cinkeys' to set the keys
	that trigger reindenting in insert mode and 'cinoptions' to set your
	preferred indent style.
	If 'indentexpr' is not empty, it overrules 'cindent'.
	If 'lisp' is not on and both 'indentexpr' and 'equalprg' are empty,
	the "=" operator indents using this algorithm rather than calling an
	external program.
	See |C-indenting|.
	When you don't like the way 'cindent' works, try the 'smartindent'
	option or 'indentexpr'.
	This option is not used when 'paste' is set.
	NOTE: This option is reset when 'compatible' is set.

							*'cinkeys'* *'cink'*
'cinkeys' 'cink'	string	(default "0{,0},0),:,0#,!^F,o,O,e")
			local to buffer
			{not in Vi}
			{not available when compiled without the |+cindent|
			feature}
	A list of keys that, when typed in Insert mode, cause reindenting of
	the current line.  Only used if 'cindent' is on and 'indentexpr' is
	empty.
	For the format of this option see |cinkeys-format|.
	See |C-indenting|.

						*'cinoptions'* *'cino'*
'cinoptions' 'cino'	string	(default "")
			local to buffer
			{not in Vi}
			{not available when compiled without the |+cindent|
			feature}
	The 'cinoptions' affect the way 'cindent' reindents lines in a C
	program.  See |cinoptions-values| for the values of this option, and
	|C-indenting| for info on C indenting in general.


						*'cinwords'* *'cinw'*
'cinwords' 'cinw'	string	(default "if,else,while,do,for,switch")
			local to buffer
			{not in Vi}
			{not available when compiled without both the
			|+cindent| and the |+smartindent| features}
	These keywords start an extra indent in the next line when
	'smartindent' or 'cindent' is set.  For 'cindent' this is only done at
	an appropriate place (inside {}).
	Note that 'ignorecase' isn't used for 'cinwords'.  If case doesn't
	matter, include the keyword both the uppercase and lowercase:
	"if,If,IF".

						*'clipboard'* *'cb'*
'clipboard' 'cb'	string	(default "autoselect,exclude:cons\|linux"
						  for X-windows, "" otherwise)
			global
			{not in Vi}
			{only in GUI versions or when the |+xterm_clipboard|
			feature is included}
	This option is a list of comma separated names.
	These names are recognized:

						*clipboard-unnamed*
	unnamed		When included, Vim will use the clipboard register '*'
			for all yank, delete, change and put operations which
			would normally go to the unnamed register.  When a
			register is explicitly specified, it will always be
			used regardless of whether "unnamed" is in 'clipboard'
			or not.  The clipboard register can always be
			explicitly accessed using the "* notation.  Also see
			|gui-clipboard|.

						*clipboard-unnamedplus*
	unnamedplus	A variant of the "unnamed" flag which uses the
			clipboard register '+' (|quoteplus|) instead of
			register '*' for all yank, delete, change and put
			operations which would normally go to the unnamed
			register.  When "unnamed" is also included to the
			option, yank operations (but not delete, change or
			put) will additionally copy the text into register
			'*'.
			Only available with the |+X11| feature.
			Availability can be checked with: >
				if has('unnamedplus')
<
						*clipboard-autoselect*
	autoselect	Works like the 'a' flag in 'guioptions': If present,
			then whenever Visual mode is started, or the Visual
			area extended, Vim tries to become the owner of the
			windowing system's global selection or put the
			selected text on the clipboard used by the selection
			register "*.  See |guioptions_a| and |quotestar| for
			details.  When the GUI is active, the 'a' flag in
			'guioptions' is used, when the GUI is not active, this
			"autoselect" flag is used.
			Also applies to the modeless selection.

						*clipboard-autoselectplus*
	autoselectplus  Like "autoselect" but using the + register instead of
			the * register.  Compare to the 'P' flag in
			'guioptions'.

						*clipboard-autoselectml*
	autoselectml	Like "autoselect", but for the modeless selection
			only.  Compare to the 'A' flag in 'guioptions'.

						*clipboard-html*
	html		When the clipboard contains HTML, use this when
			pasting.  When putting text on the clipboard, mark it
			as HTML.  This works to copy rendered HTML from
			Firefox, paste it as raw HTML in Vim, select the HTML
			in Vim and paste it in a rich edit box in Firefox.
			You probably want to add this only temporarily,
			possibly use BufEnter autocommands.
			Only supported for GTK version 2 and later.
			Only available with the |+multi_byte| feature.

						*clipboard-exclude*
	exclude:{pattern}
			Defines a pattern that is matched against the name of
			the terminal 'term'.  If there is a match, no
			connection will be made to the X server.  This is
			useful in this situation:
			- Running Vim in a console.
			- $DISPLAY is set to start applications on another
			  display.
			- You do not want to connect to the X server in the
			  console, but do want this in a terminal emulator.
			To never connect to the X server use: >
				exclude:.*
<			This has the same effect as using the |-X| argument.
			Note that when there is no connection to the X server
			the window title won't be restored and the clipboard
			cannot be accessed.
			The value of 'magic' is ignored, {pattern} is
			interpreted as if 'magic' was on.
			The rest of the option value will be used for
			{pattern}, this must be the last entry.

						*'cmdheight'* *'ch'*
'cmdheight' 'ch'	number	(default 1)
			global
			{not in Vi}
	Number of screen lines to use for the command-line.  Helps avoiding
	|hit-enter| prompts.
	The value of this option is stored with the tab page, so that each tab
	page can have a different value.

						*'cmdwinheight'* *'cwh'*
'cmdwinheight' 'cwh'	number	(default 7)
			global
			{not in Vi}
			{not available when compiled without the |+vertsplit|
			feature}
	Number of screen lines to use for the command-line window. |cmdwin|

						*'colorcolumn'* *'cc'*
'colorcolumn' 'cc'	string	(default "")
			local to window
			{not in Vi}
			{not available when compiled without the |+syntax|
			feature}
	'colorcolumn' is a comma separated list of screen columns that are
	highlighted with ColorColumn |hl-ColorColumn|.  Useful to align
	text.  Will make screen redrawing slower.
	The screen column can be an absolute number, or a number preceded with
	'+' or '-', which is added to or subtracted from 'textwidth'. >

		:set cc=+1  " highlight column after 'textwidth'
		:set cc=+1,+2,+3  " highlight three columns after 'textwidth'
		:hi ColorColumn ctermbg=lightgrey guibg=lightgrey
<
	When 'textwidth' is zero then the items with '-' and '+' are not used.
	A maximum of 256 columns are highlighted.

						*'columns'* *'co'* *E594*
'columns' 'co'		number	(default 80 or terminal width)
			global
			{not in Vi}
	Number of columns of the screen.  Normally this is set by the terminal
	initialization and does not have to be set by hand.  Also see
	|posix-screen-size|.
	When Vim is running in the GUI or in a resizable window, setting this
	option will cause the window size to be changed.  When you only want
	to use the size for the GUI, put the command in your |gvimrc| file.
	When you set this option and Vim is unable to change the physical
	number of columns of the display, the display may be messed up.  For
	the GUI it is always possible and Vim limits the number of columns to
	what fits on the screen.  You can use this command to get the widest
	window possible: >
		:set columns=9999
<	Minimum value is 12, maximum value is 10000.

					*'comments'* *'com'* *E524* *E525*
'comments' 'com'	string	(default
				"s1:/*,mb:*,ex:*/,://,b:#,:%,:XCOMM,n:>,fb:-")
			local to buffer
			{not in Vi}
			{not available when compiled without the |+comments|
			feature}
	A comma separated list of strings that can start a comment line.  See
	|format-comments|.  See |option-backslash| about using backslashes to
	insert a space.

					*'commentstring'* *'cms'* *E537*
'commentstring' 'cms'	string	(default "/*%s*/")
			local to buffer
			{not in Vi}
			{not available when compiled without the |+folding|
			feature}
	A template for a comment.  The "%s" in the value is replaced with the
	comment text.  Currently only used to add markers for folding, see
	|fold-marker|.

			*'compatible'* *'cp'* *'nocompatible'* *'nocp'*
'compatible' 'cp'	boolean	(default on, off when a |vimrc| or |gvimrc|
								file is found)
			global
			{not in Vi}
	This option has the effect of making Vim either more Vi-compatible, or
	make Vim behave in a more useful way.
	This is a special kind of option, because when it's set or reset,
	other options are also changed as a side effect.  CAREFUL: Setting or
	resetting this option can have a lot of unexpected effects: Mappings
	are interpreted in another way, undo behaves differently, etc.  If you
	set this option in your vimrc file, you should probably put it at the
	very start.
	By default this option is on and the Vi defaults are used for the
	options.  This default was chosen for those people who want to use Vim
	just like Vi, and don't even (want to) know about the 'compatible'
	option.
	When a |vimrc| or |gvimrc| file is found while Vim is starting up,
	this option is switched off, and all options that have not been
	modified will be set to the Vim defaults.  Effectively, this means
	that when a |vimrc| or |gvimrc| file exists, Vim will use the Vim
	defaults, otherwise it will use the Vi defaults.  (Note: This doesn't
	happen for the system-wide vimrc or gvimrc file, nor for a file given
	with the |-u| argument).  Also see |compatible-default| and
	|posix-compliance|.
	You can also set this option with the "-C" argument, and reset it with
	"-N".  See |-C| and |-N|.
	Switching this option off makes the Vim defaults be used for options
	that have a different Vi and Vim default value.  See the options
	marked with a '+' below.  Other options are not modified.
	At the moment this option is set, several other options will be set
	or reset to make Vim as Vi-compatible as possible.  See the table
	below.  This can be used if you want to revert to Vi compatible
	editing.
	See also 'cpoptions'.

	option		+ set value	effect	~

						*'complete'* *'cpt'* *E535*
'complete' 'cpt'	string	(default: ".,w,b,u,t,i")
			local to buffer
			{not in Vi}
	This option specifies how keyword completion |ins-completion| works
	when CTRL-P or CTRL-N are used.  It is also used for whole-line
	completion |i_CTRL-X_CTRL-L|.  It indicates the type of completion
	and the places to scan.  It is a comma separated list of flags:
	.	scan the current buffer ( 'wrapscan' is ignored)
	w	scan buffers from other windows
	b	scan other loaded buffers that are in the buffer list
	u	scan the unloaded buffers that are in the buffer list
	U	scan the buffers that are not in the buffer list
	k	scan the files given with the 'dictionary' option
	kspell  use the currently active spell checking |spell|
	k{dict}	scan the file {dict}.  Several "k" flags can be given,
		patterns are valid too.  For example: >
			:set cpt=k/usr/dict/*,k~/spanish
<	s	scan the files given with the 'thesaurus' option
	s{tsr}	scan the file {tsr}.  Several "s" flags can be given, patterns
		are valid too.
	i	scan current and included files
	d	scan current and included files for defined name or macro
		|i_CTRL-X_CTRL-D|
	]	tag completion
	t	same as "]"

	Unloaded buffers are not loaded, thus their autocmds |:autocmd| are
	not executed, this may lead to unexpected completions from some files
	(gzipped files for example).  Unloaded buffers are not scanned for
	whole-line completion.

	The default is ".,w,b,u,t,i", which means to scan:
	   1. the current buffer
	   2. buffers in other windows
	   3. other loaded buffers
	   4. unloaded buffers
	   5. tags
	   6. included files

	As you can see, CTRL-N and CTRL-P can be used to do any 'iskeyword'-
	based expansion (e.g., dictionary |i_CTRL-X_CTRL-K|, included patterns
	|i_CTRL-X_CTRL-I|, tags |i_CTRL-X_CTRL-]| and normal expansions).

						*'completefunc'* *'cfu'*
'completefunc' 'cfu'	string	(default: empty)
			local to buffer
			{not in Vi}
			{not available when compiled without the |+eval|
			or |+insert_expand| features}
	This option specifies a function to be used for Insert mode completion
	with CTRL-X CTRL-U. |i_CTRL-X_CTRL-U|
	See |complete-functions| for an explanation of how the function is
	invoked and what it should return.
	This option cannot be set from a |modeline| or in the |sandbox|, for
	security reasons.

						*'completeopt'* *'cot'*
'completeopt' 'cot'	string	(default: "menu,preview")
			global
			{not available when compiled without the
			|+insert_expand| feature}
			{not in Vi}
	A comma separated list of options for Insert mode completion
	|ins-completion|.  The supported values are:

	   menu	    Use a popup menu to show the possible completions.  The
		    menu is only shown when there is more than one match and
		    sufficient colors are available.  |ins-completion-menu|

	   menuone  Use the popup menu also when there is only one match.
		    Useful when there is additional information about the
		    match, e.g., what file it comes from.

	   longest  Only insert the longest common text of the matches.  If
		    the menu is displayed you can use CTRL-L to add more
		    characters.  Whether case is ignored depends on the kind
		    of completion.  For buffer text the 'ignorecase' option is
		    used.

	   preview  Show extra information about the currently selected
		    completion in the preview window.  Only works in
		    combination with "menu" or "menuone".


						*'concealcursor'* *'cocu'*
'concealcursor' 'cocu'	string (default: "")
			local to window
			{not in Vi}
			{not available when compiled without the |+conceal|
			feature}
	Sets the modes in which text in the cursor line can also be concealed.
	When the current mode is listed then concealing happens just like in
	other lines.
	  n		Normal mode
	  v		Visual mode
	  i		Insert mode
	  c		Command line editing, for 'incsearch'

	'v' applies to all lines in the Visual area, not only the cursor.
	A useful value is "nc".  This is used in help files.  So long as you
	are moving around text is concealed, but when starting to insert text
	or selecting a Visual area the concealed text is displayed, so that
	you can see what you are doing.
	Keep in mind that the cursor position is not always where it's
	displayed.  E.g., when moving vertically it may change column.


'conceallevel' 'cole'		*'conceallevel'* *'cole'*
			number (default 0)
			local to window
			{not in Vi}
			{not available when compiled without the |+conceal|
			feature}
	Determine how text with the "conceal" syntax attribute |:syn-conceal|
	is shown:

	Value		Effect ~
	0		Text is shown normally
	1		Each block of concealed text is replaced with one
			character.  If the syntax item does not have a custom
			replacement character defined (see |:syn-cchar|) the
			character defined in 'listchars' is used (default is a
			space).
			It is highlighted with the "Conceal" highlight group.
	2		Concealed text is completely hidden unless it has a
			custom replacement character defined (see
			|:syn-cchar|).
	3		Concealed text is completely hidden.

	Note: in the cursor line concealed text is not hidden, so that you can
	edit and copy the text.  This can be changed with the 'concealcursor'
	option.

				*'confirm'* *'cf'* *'noconfirm'* *'nocf'*
'confirm' 'cf'		boolean (default off)
			global
			{not in Vi}
	When 'confirm' is on, certain operations that would normally
	fail because of unsaved changes to a buffer, e.g. ":q" and ":e",
	instead raise a |dialog| asking if you wish to save the current
	file(s).  You can still use a ! to unconditionally |abandon| a buffer.
	If 'confirm' is off you can still activate confirmation for one
	command only (this is most useful in mappings) with the |:confirm|
	command.
	Also see the |confirm()| function and the 'v' flag in 'guioptions'.

			*'conskey'* *'consk'* *'noconskey'* *'noconsk'*
'conskey' 'consk'	boolean	(default off)
			global
			{not in Vi}  {only for MS-DOS}
	When on direct console I/O is used to obtain a keyboard character.
	This should work in most cases.  Also see |'bioskey'|.  Together,
	three methods of console input are available:
	'conskey'   'bioskey'	    action ~
	   on	     on or off	    direct console input
	   off		on	    BIOS
	   off		off	    STDIN

			*'copyindent'* *'ci'* *'nocopyindent'* *'noci'*
'copyindent' 'ci'	boolean	(default off)
			local to buffer
			{not in Vi}
	Copy the structure of the existing lines indent when autoindenting a
	new line.  Normally the new indent is reconstructed by a series of
	tabs followed by spaces as required (unless |'expandtab'| is enabled,
	in which case only spaces are used).  Enabling this option makes the
	new line copy whatever characters were used for indenting on the
	existing line.  'expandtab' has no effect on these characters, a Tab
	remains a Tab.  If the new indent is greater than on the existing
	line, the remaining space is filled in the normal manner.
	NOTE: 'copyindent' is reset when 'compatible' is set.
	Also see 'preserveindent'.

						*'cpoptions'* *'cpo'*
'cpoptions' 'cpo'	string	(Vim default: "aABceFs",
				 Vi default:  all flags)
			global
			{not in Vi}
	A sequence of single character flags.  When a character is present
	this indicates Vi-compatible behavior.  This is used for things where
	not being Vi-compatible is mostly or sometimes preferred.
	'cpoptions' stands for "compatible-options".
	Commas can be added for readability.
	To avoid problems with flags that are added in the future, use the
	"+=" and "-=" feature of ":set" |add-option-flags|.
	NOTE: This option is set to the Vi default value when 'compatible' is
	set and to the Vim default value when 'compatible' is reset.
	NOTE: This option is set to the POSIX default value at startup when
	the Vi default value would be used and the $VIM_POSIX environment
	variable exists |posix|.  This means Vim tries to behave like the
	POSIX specification.

	    contains	behavior	~
								*cpo-a*
		a	When included, a ":read" command with a file name
			argument will set the alternate file name for the
			current window.
								*cpo-A*
		A	When included, a ":write" command with a file name
			argument will set the alternate file name for the
			current window.
								*cpo-b*
		b	"\|" in a ":map" command is recognized as the end of
			the map command.  The '\' is included in the mapping,
			the text after the '|' is interpreted as the next
			command.  Use a CTRL-V instead of a backslash to
			include the '|' in the mapping.  Applies to all
			mapping, abbreviation, menu and autocmd commands.
			See also |map_bar|.
								*cpo-B*
		B	A backslash has no special meaning in mappings,
			abbreviations and the "to" part of the menu commands.
			Remove this flag to be able to use a backslash like a
			CTRL-V.  For example, the command ":map X \<Esc>"
			results in X being mapped to:
				'B' included:	"\^["	 (^[ is a real <Esc>)
				'B' excluded:	"<Esc>"  (5 characters)
				('<' excluded in both cases)
								*cpo-c*
		c	Searching continues at the end of any match at the
			cursor position, but not further than the start of the
			next line.  When not present searching continues
			one character from the cursor position.  With 'c'
			"abababababab" only gets three matches when repeating
			"/abab", without 'c' there are five matches.
								*cpo-C*
		C	Do not concatenate sourced lines that start with a
			backslash.  See |line-continuation|.
								*cpo-d*
		d	Using "./" in the 'tags' option doesn't mean to use
			the tags file relative to the current file, but the
			tags file in the current directory.
								*cpo-D*
		D	Can't use CTRL-K to enter a digraph after Normal mode
			commands with a character argument, like |r|, |f| and
			|t|.
								*cpo-e*
		e	When executing a register with ":@r", always add a
			<CR> to the last line, also when the register is not
			linewise.  If this flag is not present, the register
			is not linewise and the last line does not end in a
			<CR>, then the last line is put on the command-line
			and can be edited before hitting <CR>.
								*cpo-E*
		E	It is an error when using "y", "d", "c", "g~", "gu" or
			"gU" on an Empty region.  The operators only work when
			at least one character is to be operate on.  Example:
			This makes "y0" fail in the first column.
								*cpo-f*
		f	When included, a ":read" command with a file name
			argument will set the file name for the current buffer,
			if the current buffer doesn't have a file name yet.
								*cpo-F*
		F	When included, a ":write" command with a file name
			argument will set the file name for the current
			buffer, if the current buffer doesn't have a file name
			yet.  Also see |cpo-P|.
								*cpo-g*
		g	Goto line 1 when using ":edit" without argument.
								*cpo-H*
		H	When using "I" on a line with only blanks, insert
			before the last blank.  Without this flag insert after
			the last blank.
								*cpo-i*
		i	When included, interrupting the reading of a file will
			leave it modified.
								*cpo-I*
		I	When moving the cursor up or down just after inserting
			indent for 'autoindent', do not delete the indent.
								*cpo-j*
		j	When joining lines, only add two spaces after a '.',
			not after '!' or '?'.  Also see 'joinspaces'.
								*cpo-J*
		J	A |sentence| has to be followed by two spaces after
			the '.', '!' or '?'.  A <Tab> is not recognized as
			white space.
								*cpo-k*
		k	Disable the recognition of raw key codes in
			mappings, abbreviations, and the "to" part of menu
			commands.  For example, if <Key> sends ^[OA (where ^[
			is <Esc>), the command ":map X ^[OA" results in X
			being mapped to:
				'k' included:	"^[OA"	 (3 characters)
				'k' excluded:	"<Key>"  (one key code)
			Also see the '<' flag below.
								*cpo-K*
		K	Don't wait for a key code to complete when it is
			halfway a mapping.  This breaks mapping <F1><F1> when
			only part of the second <F1> has been read.  It
			enables cancelling the mapping by typing <F1><Esc>.
								*cpo-l*
		l	Backslash in a [] range in a search pattern is taken
			literally, only "\]", "\^", "\-" and "\\" are special.
			See |/[]|
			   'l' included: "/[ \t]"  finds <Space>, '\' and 't'
			   'l' excluded: "/[ \t]"  finds <Space> and <Tab>
			Also see |cpo-\|.
								*cpo-L*
		L	When the 'list' option is set, 'wrapmargin',
			'textwidth', 'softtabstop' and Virtual Replace mode
			(see |gR|) count a <Tab> as two characters, instead of
			the normal behavior of a <Tab>.
								*cpo-m*
		m	When included, a showmatch will always wait half a
			second.  When not included, a showmatch will wait half
			a second or until a character is typed.  |'showmatch'|
								*cpo-M*
		M	When excluded, "%" matching will take backslashes into
			account.  Thus in "( \( )" and "\( ( \)" the outer
			parenthesis match.  When included "%" ignores
			backslashes, which is Vi compatible.
								*cpo-n*
		n	When included, the column used for 'number' and
			'relativenumber' will also be used for text of wrapped
			lines.
								*cpo-o*
		o	Line offset to search command is not remembered for
			next search.
								*cpo-O*
		O	Don't complain if a file is being overwritten, even
			when it didn't exist when editing it.  This is a
			protection against a file unexpectedly created by
			someone else.  Vi didn't complain about this.
								*cpo-p*
		p	Vi compatible Lisp indenting.  When not present, a
			slightly better algorithm is used.
								*cpo-P*
		P	When included, a ":write" command that appends to a
			file will set the file name for the current buffer, if
			the current buffer doesn't have a file name yet and
			the 'F' flag is also included |cpo-F|.
								*cpo-q*
		q	When joining multiple lines leave the cursor at the
			position where it would be when joining two lines.
								*cpo-r*
		r	Redo ("." command) uses "/" to repeat a search
			command, instead of the actually used search string.
								*cpo-R*
		R	Remove marks from filtered lines.  Without this flag
			marks are kept like |:keepmarks| was used.
								*cpo-s*
		s	Set buffer options when entering the buffer for the
			first time.  This is like it is in Vim version 3.0.
			And it is the default.  If not present the options are
			set when the buffer is created.
								*cpo-S*
		S	Set buffer options always when entering a buffer
			(except 'readonly', 'fileformat', 'filetype' and
			'syntax').  This is the (most) Vi compatible setting.
			The options are set to the values in the current
			buffer.  When you change an option and go to another
			buffer, the value is copied.  Effectively makes the
			buffer options global to all buffers.

			's'    'S'     copy buffer options
			no     no      when buffer created
			yes    no      when buffer first entered (default)
			 X     yes     each time when buffer entered (vi comp.)
								*cpo-t*
		t	Search pattern for the tag command is remembered for
			"n" command.  Otherwise Vim only puts the pattern in
			the history for search pattern, but doesn't change the
			last used search pattern.
								*cpo-u*
		u	Undo is Vi compatible.  See |undo-two-ways|.
								*cpo-v*
		v	Backspaced characters remain visible on the screen in
			Insert mode.  Without this flag the characters are
			erased from the screen right away.  With this flag the
			screen newly typed text overwrites backspaced
			characters.
								*cpo-w*
		w	When using "cw" on a blank character, only change one
			character and not all blanks until the start of the
			next word.
								*cpo-W*
		W	Don't overwrite a readonly file.  When omitted, ":w!"
			overwrites a readonly file, if possible.
								*cpo-x*
		x	<Esc> on the command-line executes the command-line.
			The default in Vim is to abandon the command-line,
			because <Esc> normally aborts a command.  |c_<Esc>|
								*cpo-X*
		X	When using a count with "R" the replaced text is
			deleted only once.  Also when repeating "R" with "."
			and a count.
								*cpo-y*
		y	A yank command can be redone with ".".
								*cpo-Z*
		Z	When using "w!" while the 'readonly' option is set,
			don't reset 'readonly'.
								*cpo-!*
		!	When redoing a filter command, use the last used
			external command, whatever it was.  Otherwise the last
			used -filter- command is used.
								*cpo-$*
		$	When making a change to one line, don't redisplay the
			line, but put a '$' at the end of the changed text.
			The changed text will be overwritten when you type the
			new text.  The line is redisplayed if you type any
			command that moves the cursor from the insertion
			point.
								*cpo-%*
		%	Vi-compatible matching is done for the "%" command.
			Does not recognize "#if", "#endif", etc.
			Does not recognize "/*" and "*/".
			Parens inside single and double quotes are also
			counted, causing a string that contains a paren to
			disturb the matching.  For example, in a line like
			"if (strcmp("foo(", s))" the first paren does not
			match the last one.  When this flag is not included,
			parens inside single and double quotes are treated
			specially.  When matching a paren outside of quotes,
			everything inside quotes is ignored.  When matching a
			paren inside quotes, it will find the matching one (if
			there is one).  This works very well for C programs.
			This flag is also used for other features, such as
			C-indenting.
								*cpo--*
		-	When included, a vertical movement command fails when
			it would go above the first line or below the last
			line.  Without it the cursor moves to the first or
			last line, unless it already was in that line.
			Applies to the commands "-", "k", CTRL-P, "+", "j",
			CTRL-N, CTRL-J and ":1234".
								*cpo-+*
		+	When included, a ":write file" command will reset the
			'modified' flag of the buffer, even though the buffer
			itself may still be different from its file.
								*cpo-star*
		*	Use ":*" in the same way as ":@".  When not included,
			":*" is an alias for ":'<,'>", select the Visual area.
								*cpo-<*
		<	Disable the recognition of special key codes in |<>|
			form in mappings, abbreviations, and the "to" part of
			menu commands.  For example, the command
			":map X <Tab>" results in X being mapped to:
				'<' included:	"<Tab>"  (5 characters)
				'<' excluded:	"^I"	 (^I is a real <Tab>)
			Also see the 'k' flag above.
								*cpo->*
		>	When appending to a register, put a line break before
			the appended text.
								*cpo-;*
		;	When using |,| or |;| to repeat the last |t| search
			and the cursor is right in front of the searched
			character, the cursor won't move. When not included,
			the cursor would skip over it and jump to the
			following occurrence.

	POSIX flags.  These are not included in the Vi default value, except
	when $VIM_POSIX was set on startup. |posix|

	    contains	behavior	~
								*cpo-#*
		#	A count before "D", "o" and "O" has no effect.
								*cpo-&*
		&	When ":preserve" was used keep the swap file when
			exiting normally while this buffer is still loaded.
			This flag is tested when exiting.
								*cpo-\*
		\	Backslash in a [] range in a search pattern is taken
			literally, only "\]" is special  See |/[]|
			   '\' included: "/[ \-]"  finds <Space>, '\' and '-'
			   '\' excluded: "/[ \-]"  finds <Space> and '-'
			Also see |cpo-l|.
								*cpo-/*
		/	When "%" is used as the replacement string in a |:s|
			command, use the previous replacement string. |:s%|
								*cpo-{*
		{	The |{| and |}| commands also stop at a "{" character
			at the start of a line.
								*cpo-.*
		.	The ":chdir" and ":cd" commands fail if the current
			buffer is modified, unless ! is used.  Vim doesn't
			need this, since it remembers the full path of an
			opened file.
								*cpo-bar*
		|	The value of the $LINES and $COLUMNS environment
			variables overrule the terminal size values obtained
			with system specific functions.


						*'cryptmethod'* *'cm'*
'cryptmethod'		string	(default "zip")
			global or local to buffer |global-local|
			{not in Vi}
	Method used for encryption when the buffer is written to a file:
							*pkzip*
	   zip		PkZip compatible method.  A weak kind of encryption.
			Backwards compatible with Vim 7.2 and older.
							*blowfish*
	   blowfish	Blowfish method.  Medium strong encryption but it has
			an implementation flaw.  Requires Vim 7.3 or later,
			files can NOT be read by Vim 7.2 and older.  This adds
			a "seed" to the file, every time you write the file
			the encrypted bytes will be different.
							*blowfish2*
	   blowfish2	Blowfish method.  Medium strong encryption.  Requires
			Vim 7.4.399 or later, files can NOT be read by Vim 7.3
			and older.  This adds a "seed" to the file, every time
			you write the file the encrypted bytes will be
			different.  The whole undo file is encrypted, not just
			the pieces of text.

	When reading an encrypted file 'cryptmethod' will be set automatically
	to the detected method of the file being read.  Thus if you write it
	without changing 'cryptmethod' the same method will be used.
	Changing 'cryptmethod' does not mark the file as modified, you have to
	explicitly write it, you don't get a warning unless there are other
	modifications.  Also see |:X|.

	When setting the global value to an empty string, it will end up with
	the value "zip".  When setting the local value to an empty string the
	buffer will use the global value.

	When a new encryption method is added in a later version of Vim, and
	the current version does not recognize it, you will get	*E821* .
	You need to edit this file with the later version of Vim.


						*'cscopepathcomp'* *'cspc'*
'cscopepathcomp' 'cspc'	number	(default 0)
			global
			{not available when compiled without the |+cscope|
			feature}
			{not in Vi}
	Determines how many components of the path to show in a list of tags.
	See |cscopepathcomp|.

						*'cscopeprg'* *'csprg'*
'cscopeprg' 'csprg'	string	(default "cscope")
			global
			{not available when compiled without the |+cscope|
			feature}
			{not in Vi}
	Specifies the command to execute cscope.  See |cscopeprg|.
	This option cannot be set from a |modeline| or in the |sandbox|, for
	security reasons.

						*'cscopequickfix'* *'csqf'*
'cscopequickfix' 'csqf' string	(default "")
			global
			{not available when compiled without the |+cscope|
			or |+quickfix| features}
			{not in Vi}
	Specifies whether to use quickfix window to show cscope results.
	See |cscopequickfix|.

		*'cscoperelative'* *'csre'* *'nocscoperelative'* *'nocsre'*
'cscoperelative' 'csre' boolean (default off)
			global
			{not available when compiled without the |+cscope|
			feature}
			{not in Vi}
	In the absence of a prefix (-P) for cscope. setting this option enables
	to use the basename of cscope.out path as the prefix.
	See |cscoperelative|.

				*'cscopetag'* *'cst'* *'nocscopetag'* *'nocst'*
'cscopetag' 'cst'	boolean (default off)
			global
			{not available when compiled without the |+cscope|
			feature}
			{not in Vi}
	Use cscope for tag commands.  See |cscope-options|.
	NOTE: This option is reset when 'compatible' is set.

						*'cscopetagorder'* *'csto'*
'cscopetagorder' 'csto'	number	(default 0)
			global
			{not available when compiled without the |+cscope|
			feature}
			{not in Vi}
	Determines the order in which ":cstag" performs a search.  See
	|cscopetagorder|.
	NOTE: This option is set to 0 when 'compatible' is set.

					*'cscopeverbose'* *'csverb'*
					*'nocscopeverbose'* *'nocsverb'*
'cscopeverbose' 'csverb' boolean (default off)
			global
			{not available when compiled without the |+cscope|
			feature}
			{not in Vi}
	Give messages when adding a cscope database.  See |cscopeverbose|.
	NOTE: This option is reset when 'compatible' is set.

			*'cursorbind'* *'crb'* *'nocursorbind'* *'nocrb'*
'cursorbind' 'crb'	boolean  (default off)
			local to window
			{not in Vi}
			{not available when compiled without the |+cursorbind|
			feature}
	When this option is set, as the cursor in the current
	window moves other cursorbound windows (windows that also have
	this option set) move their cursors to the corresponding line and
	column.  This option is useful for viewing the
	differences between two versions of a file (see 'diff'); in diff mode,
	inserted and deleted lines (though not characters within a line) are
	taken into account.


			*'cursorcolumn'* *'cuc'* *'nocursorcolumn'* *'nocuc'*
'cursorcolumn' 'cuc'	boolean	(default off)
			local to window
			{not in Vi}
			{not available when compiled without the |+syntax|
			feature}
	Highlight the screen column of the cursor with CursorColumn
	|hl-CursorColumn|.  Useful to align text.  Will make screen redrawing
	slower.
	If you only want the highlighting in the current window you can use
	these autocommands: >
		au WinLeave * set nocursorline nocursorcolumn
		au WinEnter * set cursorline cursorcolumn
<

			*'cursorline'* *'cul'* *'nocursorline'* *'nocul'*
'cursorline' 'cul'	boolean	(default off)
			local to window
			{not in Vi}
			{not available when compiled without the |+syntax|
			feature}
	Highlight the screen line of the cursor with CursorLine
	|hl-CursorLine|.  Useful to easily spot the cursor.  Will make screen
	redrawing slower.
	When Visual mode is active the highlighting isn't used to make it
	easier to see the selected text.


						*'debug'*
'debug'			string	(default "")
			global
			{not in Vi}
	These values can be used:
	msg	Error messages that would otherwise be omitted will be given
		anyway.
	throw	Error messages that would otherwise be omitted will be given
		anyway and also throw an exception and set |v:errmsg|.
	beep	A message will be given when otherwise only a beep would be
		produced.
	The values can be combined, separated by a comma.
	"msg" and "throw" are useful for debugging 'foldexpr', 'formatexpr' or
	'indentexpr'.

						*'define'* *'def'*
'define' 'def'		string	(default "^\s*#\s*define")
			global or local to buffer |global-local|
			{not in Vi}
	Pattern to be used to find a macro definition.  It is a search
	pattern, just like for the "/" command.  This option is used for the
	commands like "[i" and "[d" |include-search|.  The 'isident' option is
	used to recognize the defined name after the match:
		{match with 'define'}{non-ID chars}{defined name}{non-ID char}
	See |option-backslash| about inserting backslashes to include a space
	or backslash.
	The default value is for C programs.  For C++ this value would be
	useful, to include const type declarations: >
		^\(#\s*define\|[a-z]*\s*const\s*[a-z]*\)
<	When using the ":set" command, you need to double the backslashes!

			*'delcombine'* *'deco'* *'nodelcombine'* *'nodeco'*
'delcombine' 'deco'	boolean (default off)
			global
			{not in Vi}
			{only available when compiled with the |+multi_byte|
			feature}
	If editing Unicode and this option is set, backspace and Normal mode
	"x" delete each combining character on its own.  When it is off (the
	default) the character along with its combining characters are
	deleted.
	Note: When 'delcombine' is set "xx" may work different from "2x"!

	This is useful for Arabic, Hebrew and many other languages where one
	may have combining characters overtop of base characters, and want
	to remove only the combining ones.

						*'dictionary'* *'dict'*
'dictionary' 'dict'	string	(default "")
			global or local to buffer |global-local|
			{not in Vi}
	List of file names, separated by commas, that are used to lookup words
	for keyword completion commands |i_CTRL-X_CTRL-K|.  Each file should
	contain a list of words.  This can be one word per line, or several
	words per line, separated by non-keyword characters (white space is
	preferred).  Maximum line length is 510 bytes.
	When this option is empty, or an entry "spell" is present, spell
	checking is enabled the currently active spelling is used. |spell|
	To include a comma in a file name precede it with a backslash.  Spaces
	after a comma are ignored, otherwise spaces are included in the file
	name.  See |option-backslash| about using backslashes.
	This has nothing to do with the |Dictionary| variable type.
	Where to find a list of words?
	- On FreeBSD, there is the file "/usr/share/dict/words".
	- In the Simtel archive, look in the "msdos/linguist" directory.
	- In "miscfiles" of the GNU collection.
	The use of |:set+=| and |:set-=| is preferred when adding or removing
	directories from the list.  This avoids problems when a future version
	uses another default.
	Backticks cannot be used in this option for security reasons.

							*'diff'* *'nodiff'*
'diff'			boolean	(default off)
			local to window
			{not in Vi}
			{not available when compiled without the |+diff|
			feature}
	Join the current window in the group of windows that shows differences
	between files.  See |vimdiff|.

						*'dex'* *'diffexpr'*
'diffexpr' 'dex'	string	(default "")
			global
			{not in Vi}
			{not available when compiled without the |+diff|
			feature}
	Expression which is evaluated to obtain an ed-style diff file from two
	versions of a file.  See |diff-diffexpr|.
	This option cannot be set from a |modeline| or in the |sandbox|, for
	security reasons.

						*'dip'* *'diffopt'*
'diffopt' 'dip'		string	(default "filler")
			global
			{not in Vi}
			{not available when compiled without the |+diff|
			feature}
	Option settings for diff mode.  It can consist of the following items.
	All are optional.  Items must be separated by a comma.

		filler		Show filler lines, to keep the text
				synchronized with a window that has inserted
				lines at the same position.  Mostly useful
				when windows are side-by-side and 'scrollbind'
				is set.

		context:{n}	Use a context of {n} lines between a change
				and a fold that contains unchanged lines.
				When omitted a context of six lines is used.
				See |fold-diff|.

		icase		Ignore changes in case of text.  "a" and "A"
				are considered the same.  Adds the "-i" flag
				to the "diff" command if 'diffexpr' is empty.

		iwhite		Ignore changes in amount of white space.  Adds
				the "-b" flag to the "diff" command if
				'diffexpr' is empty.  Check the documentation
				of the "diff" command for what this does
				exactly.  It should ignore adding trailing
				white space, but not leading white space.

		horizontal	Start diff mode with horizontal splits (unless
				explicitly specified otherwise).

		vertical	Start diff mode with vertical splits (unless
				explicitly specified otherwise).

		foldcolumn:{n}	Set the 'foldcolumn' option to {n} when
				starting diff mode.  Without this 2 is used.

	Examples: >

		:set diffopt=filler,context:4
		:set diffopt=
		:set diffopt=filler,foldcolumn:3
<
				     *'digraph'* *'dg'* *'nodigraph'* *'nodg'*
'digraph' 'dg'		boolean	(default off)
			global
			{not in Vi}
			{not available when compiled without the |+digraphs|
			feature}
	Enable the entering of digraphs in Insert mode with {char1} <BS>
	{char2}.  See |digraphs|.
	NOTE: This option is reset when 'compatible' is set.

						*'directory'* *'dir'*
'directory' 'dir'	string	(default for Amiga: ".,t:",
				 for MS-DOS and Win32: ".,$TEMP,c:\tmp,c:\temp"
				 for Unix: ".,~/tmp,/var/tmp,/tmp")
			global
	List of directory names for the swap file, separated with commas.
	- The swap file will be created in the first directory where this is
	  possible.
	- Empty means that no swap file will be used (recovery is
	  impossible!).
	- A directory "." means to put the swap file in the same directory as
	  the edited file.  On Unix, a dot is prepended to the file name, so
	  it doesn't show in a directory listing.  On MS-Windows the "hidden"
	  attribute is set and a dot prepended if possible.
	- A directory starting with "./" (or ".\" for MS-DOS et al.) means to
	  put the swap file relative to where the edited file is.  The leading
	  "." is replaced with the path name of the edited file.
	- For Unix and Win32, if a directory ends in two path separators "//"
	  or "\\", the swap file name will be built from the complete path to
	  the file with all path separators substituted to percent '%' signs.
	  This will ensure file name uniqueness in the preserve directory.
	  On Win32, when a separating comma is following, you must use "//",
	  since "\\" will include the comma in the file name.
	- Spaces after the comma are ignored, other spaces are considered part
	  of the directory name.  To have a space at the start of a directory
	  name, precede it with a backslash.
	- To include a comma in a directory name precede it with a backslash.
	- A directory name may end in an ':' or '/'.
	- Environment variables are expanded |:set_env|.
	- Careful with '\' characters, type one before a space, type two to
	  get one in the option (see |option-backslash|), for example: >
	    :set dir=c:\\tmp,\ dir\\,with\\,commas,\\\ dir\ with\ spaces
<	- For backwards compatibility with Vim version 3.0 a '>' at the start
	  of the option is removed.
	Using "." first in the list is recommended.  This means that editing
	the same file twice will result in a warning.  Using "/tmp" on Unix is
	discouraged: When the system crashes you lose the swap file.
	"/var/tmp" is often not cleared when rebooting, thus is a better
	choice than "/tmp".  But it can contain a lot of files, your swap
	files get lost in the crowd.  That is why a "tmp" directory in your
	home directory is tried first.
	The use of |:set+=| and |:set-=| is preferred when adding or removing
	directories from the list.  This avoids problems when a future version
	uses another default.
	This option cannot be set from a |modeline| or in the |sandbox|, for
	security reasons.
	{Vi: directory to put temp file in, defaults to "/tmp"}

					*'display'* *'dy'*
'display' 'dy'		string	(default "")
			global
			{not in Vi}
	Change the way text is displayed.  This is comma separated list of
	flags:
	lastline	When included, as much as possible of the last line
			in a window will be displayed.  When not included, a
			last line that doesn't fit is replaced with "@" lines.
	uhex		Show unprintable characters hexadecimal as <xx>
			instead of using ^C and ~C.

						*'eadirection'* *'ead'*
'eadirection' 'ead'	string	(default "both")
			global
			{not in Vi}
			{not available when compiled without the |+vertsplit|
			feature}
	Tells when the 'equalalways' option applies:
		ver	vertically, width of windows is not affected
		hor	horizontally, height of windows is not affected
		both	width and height of windows is affected

			   *'ed'* *'edcompatible'* *'noed'* *'noedcompatible'*
'edcompatible' 'ed'	boolean	(default off)
			global
	Makes the 'g' and 'c' flags of the ":substitute" command to be
	toggled each time the flag is given.  See |complex-change|.  See
	also 'gdefault' option.
	Switching this option on is discouraged!

					*'encoding'* *'enc'* *E543*
'encoding' 'enc'	string (default: "latin1" or value from $LANG)
			global
			{only available when compiled with the |+multi_byte|
			feature}
			{not in Vi}
	Sets the character encoding used inside Vim.  It applies to text in
	the buffers, registers, Strings in expressions, text stored in the
	viminfo file, etc.  It sets the kind of characters which Vim can work
	with.  See |encoding-names| for the possible values.

	NOTE: Changing this option will not change the encoding of the
	existing text in Vim.  It may cause non-ASCII text to become invalid.
	It should normally be kept at its default value, or set when Vim
	starts up.  See |multibyte|.  To reload the menus see |:menutrans|.

	This option cannot be set from a |modeline|.  It would most likely
	corrupt the text.

	NOTE: For GTK+ 2 it is highly recommended to set 'encoding' to
	"utf-8".  Although care has been taken to allow different values of
	'encoding', "utf-8" is the natural choice for the environment and
	avoids unnecessary conversion overhead.  "utf-8" has not been made
	the default to prevent different behavior of the GUI and terminal
	versions, and to avoid changing the encoding of newly created files
	without your knowledge (in case 'fileencodings' is empty).

	The character encoding of files can be different from 'encoding'.
	This is specified with 'fileencoding'.  The conversion is done with
	iconv() or as specified with 'charconvert'.

	If you need to know whether 'encoding' is a multi-byte encoding, you
	can use: >
		if has("multi_byte_encoding")
<
	Normally 'encoding' will be equal to your current locale.  This will
	be the default if Vim recognizes your environment settings.  If
	'encoding' is not set to the current locale, 'termencoding' must be
	set to convert typed and displayed text.  See |encoding-table|.

	When you set this option, it fires the |EncodingChanged| autocommand
	event so that you can set up fonts if necessary.

	When the option is set, the value is converted to lowercase.  Thus
	you can set it with uppercase values too.  Underscores are translated
	to '-' signs.
	When the encoding is recognized, it is changed to the standard name.
	For example "Latin-1" becomes "latin1", "ISO_88592" becomes
	"iso-8859-2" and "utf8" becomes "utf-8".

	Note: "latin1" is also used when the encoding could not be detected.
	This only works when editing files in the same encoding!  When the
	actual character set is not latin1, make sure 'fileencoding' and
	'fileencodings' are empty.  When conversion is needed, switch to using
	utf-8.

	When "unicode", "ucs-2" or "ucs-4" is used, Vim internally uses utf-8.
	You don't notice this while editing, but it does matter for the
	|viminfo-file|.  And Vim expects the terminal to use utf-8 too.  Thus
	setting 'encoding' to one of these values instead of utf-8 only has
	effect for encoding used for files when 'fileencoding' is empty.

	When 'encoding' is set to a Unicode encoding, and 'fileencodings' was
	not set yet, the default for 'fileencodings' is changed.

			*'endofline'* *'eol'* *'noendofline'* *'noeol'*
'endofline' 'eol'	boolean	(default on)
			local to buffer
			{not in Vi}
	When writing a file and this option is off and the 'binary' option
	is on, no <EOL> will be written for the last line in the file.  This
	option is automatically set when starting to edit a new file, unless
	the file does not have an <EOL> for the last line in the file, in
	which case it is reset.  Normally you don't have to set or reset this
	option.  When 'binary' is off the value is not used when writing the
	file.  When 'binary' is on it is used to remember the presence of a
	<EOL> for the last line in the file, so that when you write the file
	the situation from the original file can be kept.  But you can change
	it if you want to.

			     *'equalalways'* *'ea'* *'noequalalways'* *'noea'*
'equalalways' 'ea'	boolean	(default on)
			global
			{not in Vi}
	When on, all the windows are automatically made the same size after
	splitting or closing a window.  This also happens the moment the
	option is switched on.  When off, splitting a window will reduce the
	size of the current window and leave the other windows the same.  When
	closing a window the extra lines are given to the window next to it
	(depending on 'splitbelow' and 'splitright').
	When mixing vertically and horizontally split windows, a minimal size
	is computed and some windows may be larger if there is room.  The
	'eadirection' option tells in which direction the size is affected.
	Changing the height and width of a window can be avoided by setting
	'winfixheight' and 'winfixwidth', respectively.
	If a window size is specified when creating a new window sizes are
	currently not equalized (it's complicated, but may be implemented in
	the future).

						*'equalprg'* *'ep'*
'equalprg' 'ep'		string	(default "")
			global or local to buffer |global-local|
			{not in Vi}
	External program to use for "=" command.  When this option is empty
	the internal formatting functions are used; either 'lisp', 'cindent'
	or 'indentexpr'.  When Vim was compiled without internal formatting,
	the "indent" program is used.
	Environment variables are expanded |:set_env|.  See |option-backslash|
	about including spaces and backslashes.
	This option cannot be set from a |modeline| or in the |sandbox|, for
	security reasons.

			*'errorbells'* *'eb'* *'noerrorbells'* *'noeb'*
'errorbells' 'eb'	boolean	(default off)
			global
	Ring the bell (beep or screen flash) for error messages.  This only
	makes a difference for error messages, the bell will be used always
	for a lot of errors without a message (e.g., hitting <Esc> in Normal
	mode).  See 'visualbell' on how to make the bell behave like a beep,
	screen flash or do nothing.

						*'errorfile'* *'ef'*
'errorfile' 'ef'	string	(Amiga default: "AztecC.Err",
					others: "errors.err")
			global
			{not in Vi}
			{not available when compiled without the |+quickfix|
			feature}
	Name of the errorfile for the QuickFix mode (see |:cf|).
	When the "-q" command-line argument is used, 'errorfile' is set to the
	following argument.  See |-q|.
	NOT used for the ":make" command.  See 'makeef' for that.
	Environment variables are expanded |:set_env|.
	See |option-backslash| about including spaces and backslashes.
	This option cannot be set from a |modeline| or in the |sandbox|, for
	security reasons.

						*'errorformat'* *'efm'*
'errorformat' 'efm'	string	(default is very long)
			global or local to buffer |global-local|
			{not in Vi}
			{not available when compiled without the |+quickfix|
			feature}
	Scanf-like description of the format for the lines in the error file
	(see |errorformat|).

				     *'esckeys'* *'ek'* *'noesckeys'* *'noek'*
'esckeys' 'ek'		boolean	(Vim default: on, Vi default: off)
			global
			{not in Vi}
	Function keys that start with an <Esc> are recognized in Insert
	mode.  When this option is off, the cursor and function keys cannot be
	used in Insert mode if they start with an <Esc>.  The advantage of
	this is that the single <Esc> is recognized immediately, instead of
	after one second.  Instead of resetting this option, you might want to
	try changing the values for 'timeoutlen' and 'ttimeoutlen'.  Note that
	when 'esckeys' is off, you can still map anything, but the cursor keys
	won't work by default.
	NOTE: This option is set to the Vi default value when 'compatible' is
	set and to the Vim default value when 'compatible' is reset.

						*'eventignore'* *'ei'*
'eventignore' 'ei'	string	(default "")
			global
			{not in Vi}
			{not available when compiled without the |+autocmd|
			feature}
	A list of autocommand event names, which are to be ignored.
	When set to "all" or when "all" is one of the items, all autocommand
	events are ignored, autocommands will not be executed.
	Otherwise this is a comma separated list of event names.  Example: >
	    :set ei=WinEnter,WinLeave
<
				 *'expandtab'* *'et'* *'noexpandtab'* *'noet'*
'expandtab' 'et'	boolean	(default off)
			local to buffer
			{not in Vi}
	In Insert mode: Use the appropriate number of spaces to insert a
	<Tab>.  Spaces are used in indents with the '>' and '<' commands and
	when 'autoindent' is on.  To insert a real tab when 'expandtab' is
	on, use CTRL-V<Tab>.  See also |:retab| and |ins-expandtab|.
	NOTE: This option is reset when 'compatible' is set.

					*'exrc'* *'ex'* *'noexrc'* *'noex'*
'exrc' 'ex'		boolean (default off)
			global
			{not in Vi}
	Enables the reading of .vimrc, .exrc and .gvimrc in the current
	directory.  If you switch this option on you should also consider
	setting the 'secure' option (see |initialization|).  Using a local
	.exrc, .vimrc or .gvimrc is a potential security leak, use with care!
	also see |.vimrc| and |gui-init|.
	This option cannot be set from a |modeline| or in the |sandbox|, for
	security reasons.

				*'fileencoding'* *'fenc'* *E213*
'fileencoding' 'fenc'	string (default: "")
			local to buffer
			{only available when compiled with the |+multi_byte|
			feature}
			{not in Vi}
	Sets the character encoding for the file of this buffer.

	When 'fileencoding' is different from 'encoding', conversion will be
	done when writing the file.  For reading see below.
	When 'fileencoding' is empty, the same value as 'encoding' will be
	used (no conversion when reading or writing a file).
	Conversion will also be done when 'encoding' and 'fileencoding' are
	both a Unicode encoding and 'fileencoding' is not utf-8.  That's
	because internally Unicode is always stored as utf-8.
		WARNING: Conversion can cause loss of information!  When
		'encoding' is "utf-8" or another Unicode encoding, conversion
		is most likely done in a way that the reverse conversion
		results in the same text.  When 'encoding' is not "utf-8" some
		characters may be lost!

	See 'encoding' for the possible values.  Additionally, values may be
	specified that can be handled by the converter, see
	|mbyte-conversion|.

	When reading a file 'fileencoding' will be set from 'fileencodings'.
	To read a file in a certain encoding it won't work by setting
	'fileencoding', use the |++enc| argument.  One exception: when
	'fileencodings' is empty the value of 'fileencoding' is used.
	For a new file the global value of 'fileencoding' is used.

	Prepending "8bit-" and "2byte-" has no meaning here, they are ignored.
	When the option is set, the value is converted to lowercase.  Thus
	you can set it with uppercase values too.  '_' characters are
	replaced with '-'.  If a name is recognized from the list for
	'encoding', it is replaced by the standard name.  For example
	"ISO8859-2" becomes "iso-8859-2".

	When this option is set, after starting to edit a file, the 'modified'
	option is set, because the file would be different when written.

	Keep in mind that changing 'fenc' from a modeline happens
	AFTER the text has been read, thus it applies to when the file will be
	written.  If you do set 'fenc' in a modeline, you might want to set
	'nomodified' to avoid not being able to ":q".

	This option can not be changed when 'modifiable' is off.

							*'fe'*
	NOTE: Before version 6.0 this option specified the encoding for the
	whole of Vim, this was a mistake.  Now use 'encoding' instead.  The
	old short name was 'fe', which is no longer used.

					*'fileencodings'* *'fencs'*
'fileencodings' 'fencs'	string (default: "ucs-bom",
				    "ucs-bom,utf-8,default,latin1" when
				    'encoding' is set to a Unicode value)
			global
			{only available when compiled with the |+multi_byte|
			feature}
			{not in Vi}
	This is a list of character encodings considered when starting to edit
	an existing file.  When a file is read, Vim tries to use the first
	mentioned character encoding.  If an error is detected, the next one
	in the list is tried.  When an encoding is found that works,
	'fileencoding' is set to it.  If all fail, 'fileencoding' is set to
	an empty string, which means the value of 'encoding' is used.
		WARNING: Conversion can cause loss of information!  When
		'encoding' is "utf-8" (or one of the other Unicode variants)
		conversion is most likely done in a way that the reverse
		conversion results in the same text.  When 'encoding' is not
		"utf-8" some non-ASCII characters may be lost!  You can use
		the |++bad| argument to specify what is done with characters
		that can't be converted.
	For an empty file or a file with only ASCII characters most encodings
	will work and the first entry of 'fileencodings' will be used (except
	"ucs-bom", which requires the BOM to be present).  If you prefer
	another encoding use an BufReadPost autocommand event to test if your
	preferred encoding is to be used.  Example: >
		au BufReadPost * if search('\S', 'w') == 0 |
			\ set fenc=iso-2022-jp | endif
<	This sets 'fileencoding' to "iso-2022-jp" if the file does not contain
	non-blank characters.
	When the |++enc| argument is used then the value of 'fileencodings' is
	not used.
	Note that 'fileencodings' is not used for a new file, the global value
	of 'fileencoding' is used instead.  You can set it with: >
		:setglobal fenc=iso-8859-2
<	This means that a non-existing file may get a different encoding than
	an empty file.
	The special value "ucs-bom" can be used to check for a Unicode BOM
	(Byte Order Mark) at the start of the file.  It must not be preceded
	by "utf-8" or another Unicode encoding for this to work properly.
	An entry for an 8-bit encoding (e.g., "latin1") should be the last,
	because Vim cannot detect an error, thus the encoding is always
	accepted.
	The special value "default" can be used for the encoding from the
	environment.  This is the default value for 'encoding'.  It is useful
	when 'encoding' is set to "utf-8" and your environment uses a
	non-latin1 encoding, such as Russian.
	When 'encoding' is "utf-8" and a file contains an illegal byte
	sequence it won't be recognized as UTF-8.  You can use the |8g8|
	command to find the illegal byte sequence.
	WRONG VALUES:			WHAT'S WRONG:
		latin1,utf-8		"latin1" will always be used
		utf-8,ucs-bom,latin1	BOM won't be recognized in an utf-8
					file
		cp1250,latin1		"cp1250" will always be used
	If 'fileencodings' is empty, 'fileencoding' is not modified.
	See 'fileencoding' for the possible values.
	Setting this option does not have an effect until the next time a file
	is read.

					*'fileformat'* *'ff'*
'fileformat' 'ff'	string (MS-DOS, MS-Windows, OS/2 default: "dos",
				Unix default: "unix",
				Macintosh default: "mac")
			local to buffer
			{not in Vi}
	This gives the <EOL> of the current buffer, which is used for
	reading/writing the buffer from/to a file:
	    dos	    <CR> <NL>
	    unix    <NL>
	    mac	    <CR>
	When "dos" is used, CTRL-Z at the end of a file is ignored.
	See |file-formats| and |file-read|.
	For the character encoding of the file see 'fileencoding'.
	When 'binary' is set, the value of 'fileformat' is ignored, file I/O
	works like it was set to "unix".
	This option is set automatically when starting to edit a file and
	'fileformats' is not empty and 'binary' is off.
	When this option is set, after starting to edit a file, the 'modified'
	option is set, because the file would be different when written.
	This option can not be changed when 'modifiable' is off.
	For backwards compatibility: When this option is set to "dos",
	'textmode' is set, otherwise 'textmode' is reset.

					*'fileformats'* *'ffs'*
'fileformats' 'ffs'	string (default:
				Vim+Vi	MS-DOS, MS-Windows OS/2: "dos,unix",
				Vim	Unix: "unix,dos",
				Vim	Mac: "mac,unix,dos",
				Vi	Cygwin: "unix,dos",
				Vi	others: "")
			global
			{not in Vi}
	This gives the end-of-line (<EOL>) formats that will be tried when
	starting to edit a new buffer and when reading a file into an existing
	buffer:
	- When empty, the format defined with 'fileformat' will be used
	  always.  It is not set automatically.
	- When set to one name, that format will be used whenever a new buffer
	  is opened.  'fileformat' is set accordingly for that buffer.  The
	  'fileformats' name will be used when a file is read into an existing
	  buffer, no matter what 'fileformat' for that buffer is set to.
	- When more than one name is present, separated by commas, automatic
	  <EOL> detection will be done when reading a file.  When starting to
	  edit a file, a check is done for the <EOL>:
	  1. If all lines end in <CR><NL>, and 'fileformats' includes "dos",
	     'fileformat' is set to "dos".
	  2. If a <NL> is found and 'fileformats' includes "unix", 'fileformat'
	     is set to "unix".  Note that when a <NL> is found without a
	     preceding <CR>, "unix" is preferred over "dos".
	  3. If 'fileformat' has not yet been set, and if 'fileformats'
	     includes "mac", 'fileformat' is set to "mac".
	     This means that "mac" is only chosen when:
	      "unix" is not present or no <NL> is found in the file, and
	      "dos" is not present or no <CR><NL> is found in the file.
	     Except: if "unix" was chosen, but there is a <CR> before
	     the first <NL>, and there appear to be more <CR>s than <NL>s in
	     the first few lines, "mac" is used.
	  4. If 'fileformat' is still not set, the first name from
	     'fileformats' is used.
	  When reading a file into an existing buffer, the same is done, but
	  this happens like 'fileformat' has been set appropriately for that
	  file only, the option is not changed.
	When 'binary' is set, the value of 'fileformats' is not used.

	Note that when Vim starts up with an empty buffer this option is not
	used.  Set 'fileformat' in your .vimrc instead.

	For systems with a Dos-like <EOL> (<CR><NL>), when reading files that
	are ":source"ed and for vimrc files, automatic <EOL> detection may be
	done:
	- When 'fileformats' is empty, there is no automatic detection.  Dos
	  format will be used.
	- When 'fileformats' is set to one or more names, automatic detection
	  is done.  This is based on the first <NL> in the file: If there is a
	  <CR> in front of it, Dos format is used, otherwise Unix format is
	  used.
	Also see |file-formats|.
	For backwards compatibility: When this option is set to an empty
	string or one format (no comma is included), 'textauto' is reset,
	otherwise 'textauto' is set.
	NOTE: This option is set to the Vi default value when 'compatible' is
	set and to the Vim default value when 'compatible' is reset.

		*'fileignorecase'* *'fic'* *'nofileignorecase'* *'nofic'*
'fileignorecase' 'fic'	boolean	(default on for systems where case in file
				 names is normally ignored)
			global
			{not in Vi}
	When set case is ignored when using file names and directories.
	See 'wildignorecase' for only ignoring case when doing completion.

					*'filetype'* *'ft'*
'filetype' 'ft'		string (default: "")
			local to buffer
			{not in Vi}
			{not available when compiled without the |+autocmd|
			feature}
	When this option is set, the FileType autocommand event is triggered.
	All autocommands that match with the value of this option will be
	executed.  Thus the value of 'filetype' is used in place of the file
	name.
	Otherwise this option does not always reflect the current file type.
	This option is normally set when the file type is detected.  To enable
	this use the ":filetype on" command. |:filetype|
	Setting this option to a different value is most useful in a modeline,
	for a file for which the file type is not automatically recognized.
	Example, for in an IDL file:
		/* vim: set filetype=idl : */ ~
	|FileType| |filetypes|
	When a dot appears in the value then this separates two filetype
	names.  Example:
		/* vim: set filetype=c.doxygen : */ ~
	This will use the "c" filetype first, then the "doxygen" filetype.
	This works both for filetype plugins and for syntax files.  More than
	one dot may appear.
	This option is not copied to another buffer, independent of the 's' or
	'S' flag in 'cpoptions'.
	Only normal file name characters can be used, "/\*?[|<>" are illegal.

						*'fillchars'* *'fcs'*
'fillchars' 'fcs'	string	(default "vert:|,fold:-")
			global
			{not in Vi}
			{not available when compiled without the |+windows|
			and |+folding| features}
	Characters to fill the statuslines and vertical separators.
	It is a comma separated list of items:

	  item		default		Used for ~
	  stl:c		' ' or '^'	statusline of the current window
	  stlnc:c	' ' or '-'	statusline of the non-current windows
	  vert:c	'|'		vertical separators |:vsplit|
	  fold:c	'-'		filling 'foldtext'
	  diff:c	'-'		deleted lines of the 'diff' option

	Any one that is omitted will fall back to the default.  For "stl" and
	"stlnc" the space will be used when there is highlighting, '^' or '-'
	otherwise.

	Example: >
	    :set fillchars=stl:^,stlnc:-,vert:\|,fold:-,diff:-
<	This is similar to the default, except that these characters will also
	be used when there is highlighting.

	for "stl" and "stlnc" only single-byte values are supported.

	The highlighting used for these items:
	  item		highlight group ~
	  stl:c		StatusLine		|hl-StatusLine|
	  stlnc:c	StatusLineNC		|hl-StatusLineNC|
	  vert:c	VertSplit		|hl-VertSplit|
	  fold:c	Folded			|hl-Folded|
	  diff:c	DiffDelete		|hl-DiffDelete|

					*'fkmap'* *'fk'* *'nofkmap'* *'nofk'*
'fkmap' 'fk'		boolean (default off)			*E198*
			global
			{not in Vi}
			{only available when compiled with the |+rightleft|
			feature}
	When on, the keyboard is mapped for the Farsi character set.
	Normally you would set 'allowrevins' and use CTRL-_ in insert mode to
	toggle this option |i_CTRL-_|.  See |farsi.txt|.

						*'foldclose'* *'fcl'*
'foldclose' 'fcl'	string (default "")
			global
			{not in Vi}
			{not available when compiled without the |+folding|
			feature}
	When set to "all", a fold is closed when the cursor isn't in it and
	its level is higher than 'foldlevel'.  Useful if you want folds to
	automatically close when moving out of them.

						*'foldcolumn'* *'fdc'*
'foldcolumn' 'fdc'	number (default 0)
			local to window
			{not in Vi}
			{not available when compiled without the |+folding|
			feature}
	When non-zero, a column with the specified width is shown at the side
	of the window which indicates open and closed folds.  The maximum
	value is 12.
	See |folding|.

			*'foldenable'* *'fen'* *'nofoldenable'* *'nofen'*
'foldenable' 'fen'	boolean (default on)
			local to window
			{not in Vi}
			{not available when compiled without the |+folding|
			feature}
	When off, all folds are open.  This option can be used to quickly
	switch between showing all text unfolded and viewing the text with
	folds (including manually opened or closed folds).  It can be toggled
	with the |zi| command.  The 'foldcolumn' will remain blank when
	'foldenable' is off.
	This option is set by commands that create a new fold or close a fold.
	See |folding|.

						*'foldexpr'* *'fde'*
'foldexpr' 'fde'	string (default: "0")
			local to window
			{not in Vi}
			{not available when compiled without the |+folding|
			or |+eval| features}
	The expression used for when 'foldmethod' is "expr".  It is evaluated
	for each line to obtain its fold level.  See |fold-expr|.

	The expression will be evaluated in the |sandbox| if set from a
	modeline, see |sandbox-option|.
	This option can't be set from a |modeline| when the 'diff' option is
	on.

	It is not allowed to change text or jump to another window while
	evaluating 'foldexpr' |textlock|.

						*'foldignore'* *'fdi'*
'foldignore' 'fdi'	string (default: "#")
			local to window
			{not in Vi}
			{not available when compiled without the |+folding|
			feature}
	Used only when 'foldmethod' is "indent".  Lines starting with
	characters in 'foldignore' will get their fold level from surrounding
	lines.  White space is skipped before checking for this character.
	The default "#" works well for C programs.  See |fold-indent|.

						*'foldlevel'* *'fdl'*
'foldlevel' 'fdl'	number (default: 0)
			local to window
			{not in Vi}
			{not available when compiled without the |+folding|
			feature}
	Sets the fold level: Folds with a higher level will be closed.
	Setting this option to zero will close all folds.  Higher numbers will
	close fewer folds.
	This option is set by commands like |zm|, |zM| and |zR|.
	See |fold-foldlevel|.

						*'foldlevelstart'* *'fdls'*
'foldlevelstart' 'fdls'	number (default: -1)
			global
			{not in Vi}
			{not available when compiled without the |+folding|
			feature}
	Sets 'foldlevel' when starting to edit another buffer in a window.
	Useful to always start editing with all folds closed (value zero),
	some folds closed (one) or no folds closed (99).
	This is done before reading any modeline, thus a setting in a modeline
	overrules this option.  Starting to edit a file for |diff-mode| also
	ignores this option and closes all folds.
	It is also done before BufReadPre autocommands, to allow an autocmd to
	overrule the 'foldlevel' value for specific files.
	When the value is negative, it is not used.

						*'foldmarker'* *'fmr'* *E536*
'foldmarker' 'fmr'	string (default: "{{{,}}}")
			local to window
			{not in Vi}
			{not available when compiled without the |+folding|
			feature}
	The start and end marker used when 'foldmethod' is "marker".  There
	must be one comma, which separates the start and end marker.  The
	marker is a literal string (a regular expression would be too slow).
	See |fold-marker|.

						*'foldmethod'* *'fdm'*
'foldmethod' 'fdm'	string (default: "manual")
			local to window
			{not in Vi}
			{not available when compiled without the |+folding|
			feature}
	The kind of folding used for the current window.  Possible values:
	|fold-manual|	manual	    Folds are created manually.
	|fold-indent|	indent	    Lines with equal indent form a fold.
	|fold-expr|	expr	    'foldexpr' gives the fold level of a line.
	|fold-marker|	marker	    Markers are used to specify folds.
	|fold-syntax|	syntax	    Syntax highlighting items specify folds.
	|fold-diff|	diff	    Fold text that is not changed.

						*'foldminlines'* *'fml'*
'foldminlines' 'fml'	number (default: 1)
			local to window
			{not in Vi}
			{not available when compiled without the |+folding|
			feature}
	Sets the number of screen lines above which a fold can be displayed
	closed.  Also for manually closed folds.  With the default value of
	one a fold can only be closed if it takes up two or more screen lines.
	Set to zero to be able to close folds of just one screen line.
	Note that this only has an effect on what is displayed.  After using
	"zc" to close a fold, which is displayed open because it's smaller
	than 'foldminlines', a following "zc" may close a containing fold.

						*'foldnestmax'* *'fdn'*
'foldnestmax' 'fdn'	number (default: 20)
			local to window
			{not in Vi}
			{not available when compiled without the |+folding|
			feature}
	Sets the maximum nesting of folds for the "indent" and "syntax"
	methods.  This avoids that too many folds will be created.  Using more
	than 20 doesn't work, because the internal limit is 20.

						*'foldopen'* *'fdo'*
'foldopen' 'fdo'	string (default: "block,hor,mark,percent,quickfix,
							     search,tag,undo")
			global
			{not in Vi}
			{not available when compiled without the |+folding|
			feature}
	Specifies for which type of commands folds will be opened, if the
	command moves the cursor into a closed fold.  It is a comma separated
	list of items.
	NOTE: When the command is part of a mapping this option is not used.
	Add the |zv| command to the mapping to get the same effect.
	(rationale: the mapping may want to control opening folds itself)

		item		commands ~
		all		any
		block		"(", "{", "[[", "[{", etc.
		hor		horizontal movements: "l", "w", "fx", etc.
		insert		any command in Insert mode
		jump		far jumps: "G", "gg", etc.
		mark		jumping to a mark: "'m", CTRL-O, etc.
		percent		"%"
		quickfix	":cn", ":crew", ":make", etc.
		search		search for a pattern: "/", "n", "*", "gd", etc.
				(not for a search pattern in a ":" command)
				Also for |[s| and |]s|.
		tag		jumping to a tag: ":ta", CTRL-T, etc.
		undo		undo or redo: "u" and CTRL-R
	When a movement command is used for an operator (e.g., "dl" or "y%")
	this option is not used.  This means the operator will include the
	whole closed fold.
	Note that vertical movements are not here, because it would make it
	very difficult to move onto a closed fold.
	In insert mode the folds containing the cursor will always be open
	when text is inserted.
	To close folds you can re-apply 'foldlevel' with the |zx| command or
	set the 'foldclose' option to "all".

						*'foldtext'* *'fdt'*
'foldtext' 'fdt'	string (default: "foldtext()")
			local to window
			{not in Vi}
			{not available when compiled without the |+folding|
			feature}
	An expression which is used to specify the text displayed for a closed
	fold.  See |fold-foldtext|.

	The expression will be evaluated in the |sandbox| if set from a
	modeline, see |sandbox-option|.

	It is not allowed to change text or jump to another window while
	evaluating 'foldtext' |textlock|.

					*'formatoptions'* *'fo'*
'formatoptions' 'fo'	string (Vim default: "tcq", Vi default: "vt")
			local to buffer
			{not in Vi}
	This is a sequence of letters which describes how automatic
	formatting is to be done.  See |fo-table|.  When the 'paste' option is
	on, no formatting is done (like 'formatoptions' is empty).  Commas can
	be inserted for readability.
	To avoid problems with flags that are added in the future, use the
	"+=" and "-=" feature of ":set" |add-option-flags|.
	NOTE: This option is set to the Vi default value when 'compatible' is
	set and to the Vim default value when 'compatible' is reset.

					*'formatlistpat'* *'flp'*
'formatlistpat' 'flp'	string (default: "^\s*\d\+[\]:.)}\t ]\s*")
			local to buffer
			{not in Vi}
	A pattern that is used to recognize a list header.  This is used for
	the "n" flag in 'formatoptions'.
	The pattern must match exactly the text that will be the indent for
	the line below it.  You can use |/\ze| to mark the end of the match
	while still checking more characters.  There must be a character
	following the pattern, when it matches the whole line it is handled
	like there is no match.
	The default recognizes a number, followed by an optional punctuation
	character and white space.

						*'formatprg'* *'fp'*
'formatprg' 'fp'	string (default "")
			global
			{not in Vi}
	The name of an external program that will be used to format the lines
	selected with the |gq| operator.  The program must take the input on
	stdin and produce the output on stdout.  The Unix program "fmt" is
	such a program.
	If the 'formatexpr' option is not empty it will be used instead.
	Otherwise, if 'formatprg' option is an empty string, the internal
	format function will be used |C-indenting|.
	Environment variables are expanded |:set_env|.  See |option-backslash|
	about including spaces and backslashes.
	This option cannot be set from a |modeline| or in the |sandbox|, for
	security reasons.

						*'formatexpr'* *'fex'*
'formatexpr' 'fex'	string (default "")
			local to buffer
			{not in Vi}
			{not available when compiled without the |+eval|
			feature}
	Expression which is evaluated to format a range of lines for the |gq|
	operator or automatic formatting (see 'formatoptions').  When this
	option is empty 'formatprg' is used.

	The |v:lnum|  variable holds the first line to be formatted.
	The |v:count| variable holds the number of lines to be formatted.
	The |v:char|  variable holds the character that is going to be
		      inserted if the expression is being evaluated due to
		      automatic formatting.  This can be empty.  Don't insert
		      it yet!

	Example: >
		:set formatexpr=mylang#Format()
<	This will invoke the mylang#Format() function in the
	autoload/mylang.vim file in 'runtimepath'. |autoload|

	The expression is also evaluated when 'textwidth' is set and adding
	text beyond that limit.  This happens under the same conditions as
	when internal formatting is used.  Make sure the cursor is kept in the
	same spot relative to the text then!  The |mode()| function will
	return "i" or "R" in this situation.
	
	When the expression evaluates to non-zero Vim will fall back to using
	the internal format mechanism.

	The expression will be evaluated in the |sandbox| when set from a
	modeline, see |sandbox-option|.  That stops the option from working,
	since changing the buffer text is not allowed.

						*'fsync'* *'fs'*
'fsync' 'fs'		boolean	(default on)
			global
			{not in Vi}
	When on, the library function fsync() will be called after writing a
	file.  This will flush a file to disk, ensuring that it is safely
	written even on filesystems which do metadata-only journaling.  This
	will force the harddrive to spin up on Linux systems running in laptop
	mode, so it may be undesirable in some situations.  Be warned that
	turning this off increases the chances of data loss after a crash.  On
	systems without an fsync() implementation, this variable is always
	off.
	Also see 'swapsync' for controlling fsync() on swap files.

				   *'gdefault'* *'gd'* *'nogdefault'* *'nogd'*
'gdefault' 'gd'		boolean	(default off)
			global
			{not in Vi}
	When on, the ":substitute" flag 'g' is default on.  This means that
	all matches in a line are substituted instead of one.  When a 'g' flag
	is given to a ":substitute" command, this will toggle the substitution
	of all or one match.  See |complex-change|.

		command		'gdefault' on	'gdefault' off	~
		:s///		  subst. all	  subst. one
		:s///g		  subst. one	  subst. all
		:s///gg		  subst. all	  subst. one

	NOTE: This option is reset when 'compatible' is set.

						*'grepformat'* *'gfm'*
'grepformat' 'gfm'	string	(default "%f:%l:%m,%f:%l%m,%f  %l%m")
			global
			{not in Vi}
	Format to recognize for the ":grep" command output.
	This is a scanf-like string that uses the same format as the
	'errorformat' option: see |errorformat|.

						*'grepprg'* *'gp'*
'grepprg' 'gp'		string	(default "grep -n ",
					Unix: "grep -n $* /dev/null",
					Win32: "findstr /n" or "grep -n",
						      VMS: "SEARCH/NUMBERS ")
			global or local to buffer |global-local|
			{not in Vi}
	Program to use for the |:grep| command.  This option may contain '%'
	and '#' characters, which are expanded like when used in a command-
	line.  The placeholder "$*" is allowed to specify where the arguments
	will be included.  Environment variables are expanded |:set_env|.  See
	|option-backslash| about including spaces and backslashes.
	When your "grep" accepts the "-H" argument, use this to make ":grep"
	also work well with a single file: >
		:set grepprg=grep\ -nH
<	Special value: When 'grepprg' is set to "internal" the |:grep| command
	works like |:vimgrep|, |:lgrep| like |:lvimgrep|, |:grepadd| like
	|:vimgrepadd| and |:lgrepadd| like |:lvimgrepadd|.
	See also the section |:make_makeprg|, since most of the comments there
	apply equally to 'grepprg'.
	For Win32, the default is "findstr /n" if "findstr.exe" can be found,
	otherwise it's "grep -n".
	This option cannot be set from a |modeline| or in the |sandbox|, for
	security reasons.

			*'guicursor'* *'gcr'* *E545* *E546* *E548* *E549*
'guicursor' 'gcr'	string	(default "n-v-c:block-Cursor/lCursor,
					ve:ver35-Cursor,
					o:hor50-Cursor,
					i-ci:ver25-Cursor/lCursor,
					r-cr:hor20-Cursor/lCursor,
					sm:block-Cursor
					-blinkwait175-blinkoff150-blinkon175",
				for MS-DOS and Win32 console:
					"n-v-c:block,o:hor50,i-ci:hor15,
					r-cr:hor30,sm:block")
			global
			{not in Vi}
			{only available when compiled with GUI enabled, and
			for MS-DOS and Win32 console}
	This option tells Vim what the cursor should look like in different
	modes.  It fully works in the GUI.  In an MSDOS or Win32 console, only
	the height of the cursor can be changed.  This can be done by
	specifying a block cursor, or a percentage for a vertical or
	horizontal cursor.
	For a console the 't_SI' and 't_EI' escape sequences are used.

	The option is a comma separated list of parts.  Each part consist of a
	mode-list and an argument-list:
		mode-list:argument-list,mode-list:argument-list,..
	The mode-list is a dash separated list of these modes:
		n	Normal mode
		v	Visual mode
		ve	Visual mode with 'selection' "exclusive" (same as 'v',
			if not specified)
		o	Operator-pending mode
		i	Insert mode
		r	Replace mode
		c	Command-line Normal (append) mode
		ci	Command-line Insert mode
		cr	Command-line Replace mode
		sm	showmatch in Insert mode
		a	all modes
	The argument-list is a dash separated list of these arguments:
		hor{N}	horizontal bar, {N} percent of the character height
		ver{N}	vertical bar, {N} percent of the character width
		block	block cursor, fills the whole character
			[only one of the above three should be present]
		blinkwait{N}				*cursor-blinking*
		blinkon{N}
		blinkoff{N}
			blink times for cursor: blinkwait is the delay before
			the cursor starts blinking, blinkon is the time that
			the cursor is shown and blinkoff is the time that the
			cursor is not shown.  The times are in msec.  When one
			of the numbers is zero, there is no blinking.  The
			default is: "blinkwait700-blinkon400-blinkoff250".
			These numbers are used for a missing entry.  This
			means that blinking is enabled by default.  To switch
			blinking off you can use "blinkon0".  The cursor only
			blinks when Vim is waiting for input, not while
			executing a command.
			To make the cursor blink in an xterm, see
			|xterm-blink|.
		{group-name}
			a highlight group name, that sets the color and font
			for the cursor
		{group-name}/{group-name}
			Two highlight group names, the first is used when
			no language mappings are used, the other when they
			are. |language-mapping|

	Examples of parts:
	   n-c-v:block-nCursor	in Normal, Command-line and Visual mode, use a
				block cursor with colors from the "nCursor"
				highlight group
	   i-ci:ver30-iCursor-blinkwait300-blinkon200-blinkoff150
				In Insert and Command-line Insert mode, use a
				30% vertical bar cursor with colors from the
				"iCursor" highlight group.  Blink a bit
				faster.

	The 'a' mode is different.  It will set the given argument-list for
	all modes.  It does not reset anything to defaults.  This can be used
	to do a common setting for all modes.  For example, to switch off
	blinking: "a:blinkon0"

	Examples of cursor highlighting: >
	    :highlight Cursor gui=reverse guifg=NONE guibg=NONE
	    :highlight Cursor gui=NONE guifg=bg guibg=fg
<
					*'guifont'* *'gfn'*
						   *E235* *E596*
'guifont' 'gfn'		string	(default "")
			global
			{not in Vi}
			{only available when compiled with GUI enabled}
	This is a list of fonts which will be used for the GUI version of Vim.
	In its simplest form the value is just one font name.  When
	the font cannot be found you will get an error message.  To try other
	font names a list can be specified, font names separated with commas.
	The first valid font is used.

	On systems where 'guifontset' is supported (X11) and 'guifontset' is
	not empty, then 'guifont' is not used.

	Spaces after a comma are ignored.  To include a comma in a font name
	precede it with a backslash.  Setting an option requires an extra
	backslash before a space and a backslash.  See also
	|option-backslash|.  For example: >
	    :set guifont=Screen15,\ 7x13,font\\,with\\,commas
<	will make Vim try to use the font "Screen15" first, and if it fails it
	will try to use "7x13" and then "font,with,commas" instead.

	If none of the fonts can be loaded, Vim will keep the current setting.
	If an empty font list is given, Vim will try using other resource
	settings (for X, it will use the Vim.font resource), and finally it
	will try some builtin default which should always be there ("7x13" in
	the case of X).  The font names given should be "normal" fonts.  Vim
	will try to find the related bold and italic fonts.

	For Win32, GTK, Motif, Mac OS and Photon: >
	    :set guifont=*
<	will bring up a font requester, where you can pick the font you want.

	The font name depends on the GUI used.  See |setting-guifont| for a
	way to set 'guifont' for various systems.

	For the GTK+ 2 GUI the font name looks like this: >
	    :set guifont=Andale\ Mono\ 11
<	That's all.  XLFDs are not used.  For Chinese this is reported to work
	well: >
	    if has("gui_gtk2")
	      set guifont=Bitstream\ Vera\ Sans\ Mono\ 12,Fixed\ 12
	      set guifontwide=Microsoft\ Yahei\ 12,WenQuanYi\ Zen\ Hei\ 12
	    endif
<
	For Mac OSX you can use something like this: >
	    :set guifont=Monaco:h10
<	Also see 'macatsui', it can help fix display problems.
								*E236*
	Note that the fonts must be mono-spaced (all characters have the same
	width).  An exception is GTK 2: all fonts are accepted, but
	mono-spaced fonts look best.

	To preview a font on X11, you might be able to use the "xfontsel"
	program.  The "xlsfonts" program gives a list of all available fonts.

	For the Win32 GUI					*E244* *E245*
	- takes these options in the font name:
		hXX - height is XX (points, can be floating-point)
		wXX - width is XX (points, can be floating-point)
		b   - bold
		i   - italic
		u   - underline
		s   - strikeout
		cXX - character set XX.  Valid charsets are: ANSI, ARABIC,
		      BALTIC, CHINESEBIG5, DEFAULT, EASTEUROPE, GB2312, GREEK,
		      HANGEUL, HEBREW, JOHAB, MAC, OEM, RUSSIAN, SHIFTJIS,
		      SYMBOL, THAI, TURKISH, VIETNAMESE ANSI and BALTIC.
		      Normally you would use "cDEFAULT".

	  Use a ':' to separate the options.
	- A '_' can be used in the place of a space, so you don't need to use
	  backslashes to escape the spaces.
	- Examples: >
	    :set guifont=courier_new:h12:w5:b:cRUSSIAN
	    :set guifont=Andale_Mono:h7.5:w4.5
<	See also |font-sizes|.

					*'guifontset'* *'gfs'*
					*E250* *E252* *E234* *E597* *E598*
'guifontset' 'gfs'	string	(default "")
			global
			{not in Vi}
			{only available when compiled with GUI enabled and
			with the |+xfontset| feature}
			{not available in the GTK+ 2 GUI}
	When not empty, specifies two (or more) fonts to be used.  The first
	one for normal English, the second one for your special language.  See
	|xfontset|.
	Setting this option also means that all font names will be handled as
	a fontset name.  Also the ones used for the "font" argument of the
	|:highlight| command.
	The fonts must match with the current locale.  If fonts for the
	character sets that the current locale uses are not included, setting
	'guifontset' will fail.
	Note the difference between 'guifont' and 'guifontset': In 'guifont'
	the comma-separated names are alternative names, one of which will be
	used.  In 'guifontset' the whole string is one fontset name,
	including the commas.  It is not possible to specify alternative
	fontset names.
	This example works on many X11 systems: >
		:set guifontset=-*-*-medium-r-normal--16-*-*-*-c-*-*-*
<
				*'guifontwide'* *'gfw'* *E231* *E533* *E534*
'guifontwide' 'gfw'	string	(default "")
			global
			{not in Vi}
			{only available when compiled with GUI enabled}
	When not empty, specifies a comma-separated list of fonts to be used
	for double-width characters.  The first font that can be loaded is
	used.
	Note: The size of these fonts must be exactly twice as wide as the one
	specified with 'guifont' and the same height.

	All GUI versions but GTK+ 2:

	'guifontwide' is only used when 'encoding' is set to "utf-8" and
	'guifontset' is empty or invalid.
	When 'guifont' is set and a valid font is found in it and
	'guifontwide' is empty Vim will attempt to find a matching
	double-width font and set 'guifontwide' to it.

	GTK+ 2 GUI only:			*guifontwide_gtk2*

	If set and valid, 'guifontwide' is always used for double width
	characters, even if 'encoding' is not set to "utf-8".
	Vim does not attempt to find an appropriate value for 'guifontwide'
	automatically.  If 'guifontwide' is empty Pango/Xft will choose the
	font for characters not available in 'guifont'.  Thus you do not need
	to set 'guifontwide' at all unless you want to override the choice
	made by Pango/Xft.

	Windows +multibyte only:		*guifontwide_win_mbyte*

	If set and valid, 'guifontwide' is used for IME instead of 'guifont'.

						*'guiheadroom'* *'ghr'*
'guiheadroom' 'ghr'	number	(default 50)
			global
			{not in Vi} {only for GTK and X11 GUI}
	The number of pixels subtracted from the screen height when fitting
	the GUI window on the screen.  Set this before the GUI is started,
	e.g., in your |gvimrc| file.  When zero, the whole screen height will
	be used by the window.  When positive, the specified number of pixel
	lines will be left for window decorations and other items on the
	screen.  Set it to a negative value to allow windows taller than the
	screen.

						*'guioptions'* *'go'*
'guioptions' 'go'	string	(default "egmrLtT"   (MS-Windows),
					 "aegimrLtT" (GTK, Motif and Athena))
			global
			{not in Vi}
			{only available when compiled with GUI enabled}
	This option only has an effect in the GUI version of Vim.  It is a
	sequence of letters which describes what components and options of the
	GUI should be used.
	To avoid problems with flags that are added in the future, use the
	"+=" and "-=" feature of ":set" |add-option-flags|.

	Valid letters are as follows:
							*guioptions_a* *'go-a'*
	  'a'	Autoselect:  If present, then whenever VISUAL mode is started,
		or the Visual area extended, Vim tries to become the owner of
		the windowing system's global selection.  This means that the
		Visually highlighted text is available for pasting into other
		applications as well as into Vim itself.  When the Visual mode
		ends, possibly due to an operation on the text, or when an
		application wants to paste the selection, the highlighted text
		is automatically yanked into the "* selection register.
		Thus the selection is still available for pasting into other
		applications after the VISUAL mode has ended.
		    If not present, then Vim won't become the owner of the
		windowing system's global selection unless explicitly told to
		by a yank or delete operation for the "* register.
		The same applies to the modeless selection.
								*'go-P'*
	  'P'	Like autoselect but using the "+ register instead of the "*
	  	register.
								*'go-A'*
	  'A'	Autoselect for the modeless selection.  Like 'a', but only
		applies to the modeless selection.

		    'guioptions'   autoselect Visual  autoselect modeless ~
			 ""		 -			 -
			 "a"		yes			yes
			 "A"		 -			yes
			 "aA"		yes			yes

								*'go-c'*
	  'c'	Use console dialogs instead of popup dialogs for simple
		choices.
								*'go-e'*
	  'e'	Add tab pages when indicated with 'showtabline'.
		'guitablabel' can be used to change the text in the labels.
		When 'e' is missing a non-GUI tab pages line may be used.
		The GUI tabs are only supported on some systems, currently
		GTK, Motif, Mac OS/X and MS-Windows.
								*'go-f'*
	  'f'	Foreground: Don't use fork() to detach the GUI from the shell
		where it was started.  Use this for programs that wait for the
		editor to finish (e.g., an e-mail program).  Alternatively you
		can use "gvim -f" or ":gui -f" to start the GUI in the
		foreground.  |gui-fork|
		Note: Set this option in the vimrc file.  The forking may have
		happened already when the |gvimrc| file is read.
								*'go-i'*
	  'i'	Use a Vim icon.  For GTK with KDE it is used in the left-upper
		corner of the window.  It's black&white on non-GTK, because of
		limitations of X11.  For a color icon, see |X11-icon|.
								*'go-m'*
	  'm'	Menu bar is present.
								*'go-M'*
	  'M'	The system menu "$VIMRUNTIME/menu.vim" is not sourced.  Note
		that this flag must be added in the .vimrc file, before
		switching on syntax or filetype recognition (when the |gvimrc|
		file is sourced the system menu has already been loaded; the
		":syntax on" and ":filetype on" commands load the menu too).
								*'go-g'*
	  'g'	Grey menu items: Make menu items that are not active grey.  If
		'g' is not included inactive menu items are not shown at all.
		Exception: Athena will always use grey menu items.
								*'go-t'*
	  't'	Include tearoff menu items.  Currently only works for Win32,
		GTK+, and Motif 1.2 GUI.
								*'go-T'*
	  'T'	Include Toolbar.  Currently only in Win32, GTK+, Motif, Photon
		and Athena GUIs.
								*'go-r'*
	  'r'	Right-hand scrollbar is always present.
								*'go-R'*
	  'R'	Right-hand scrollbar is present when there is a vertically
		split window.
								*'go-l'*
	  'l'	Left-hand scrollbar is always present.
								*'go-L'*
	  'L'	Left-hand scrollbar is present when there is a vertically
		split window.
								*'go-b'*
	  'b'	Bottom (horizontal) scrollbar is present.  Its size depends on
		the longest visible line, or on the cursor line if the 'h'
		flag is included. |gui-horiz-scroll|
								*'go-h'*
	  'h'	Limit horizontal scrollbar size to the length of the cursor
		line.  Reduces computations. |gui-horiz-scroll|

	And yes, you may even have scrollbars on the left AND the right if
	you really want to :-).  See |gui-scrollbars| for more information.

								*'go-v'*
	  'v'	Use a vertical button layout for dialogs.  When not included,
		a horizontal layout is preferred, but when it doesn't fit a
		vertical layout is used anyway.
								*'go-p'*
	  'p'	Use Pointer callbacks for X11 GUI.  This is required for some
		window managers.  If the cursor is not blinking or hollow at
		the right moment, try adding this flag.  This must be done
		before starting the GUI.  Set it in your |gvimrc|.  Adding or
		removing it after the GUI has started has no effect.
								*'go-F'*
	  'F'	Add a footer.  Only for Motif.  See |gui-footer|.


						*'guipty'* *'noguipty'*
'guipty'		boolean	(default on)
			global
			{not in Vi}
			{only available when compiled with GUI enabled}
	Only in the GUI: If on, an attempt is made to open a pseudo-tty for
	I/O to/from shell commands.  See |gui-pty|.

						*'guitablabel'* *'gtl'*
'guitablabel' 'gtl'	string	(default empty)
			global
			{not in Vi}
			{only available when compiled with GUI enabled and
			with the |+windows| feature}
	When nonempty describes the text to use in a label of the GUI tab
	pages line.  When empty and when the result is empty Vim will use a
	default label.  See |setting-guitablabel| for more info.

	The format of this option is like that of 'statusline'.
	'guitabtooltip' is used for the tooltip, see below.

	Only used when the GUI tab pages line is displayed.  'e' must be
	present in 'guioptions'.  For the non-GUI tab pages line 'tabline' is
	used.

						*'guitabtooltip'* *'gtt'*
'guitabtooltip' 'gtt'	string	(default empty)
			global
			{not in Vi}
			{only available when compiled with GUI enabled and
			with the |+windows| feature}
	When nonempty describes the text to use in a tooltip for the GUI tab
	pages line.  When empty Vim will use a default tooltip.
	This option is otherwise just like 'guitablabel' above.
	You can include a line break.  Simplest method is to use |:let|: >
		:let &guitabtooltip = "line one\nline two"
<

						*'helpfile'* *'hf'*
'helpfile' 'hf'		string	(default (MSDOS)  "$VIMRUNTIME\doc\help.txt"
					 (others) "$VIMRUNTIME/doc/help.txt")
			global
			{not in Vi}
	Name of the main help file.  All distributed help files should be
	placed together in one directory.  Additionally, all "doc" directories
	in 'runtimepath' will be used.
	Environment variables are expanded |:set_env|.  For example:
	"$VIMRUNTIME/doc/help.txt".  If $VIMRUNTIME is not set, $VIM is also
	tried.  Also see |$VIMRUNTIME| and |option-backslash| about including
	spaces and backslashes.
	This option cannot be set from a |modeline| or in the |sandbox|, for
	security reasons.

						*'helpheight'* *'hh'*
'helpheight' 'hh'	number	(default 20)
			global
			{not in Vi}
			{not available when compiled without the |+windows|
			feature}
	Minimal initial height of the help window when it is opened with the
	":help" command.  The initial height of the help window is half of the
	current window, or (when the 'ea' option is on) the same as other
	windows.  When the height is less than 'helpheight', the height is
	set to 'helpheight'.  Set to zero to disable.

						*'helplang'* *'hlg'*
'helplang' 'hlg'	string	(default: messages language or empty)
			global
			{only available when compiled with the |+multi_lang|
			feature}
			{not in Vi}
	Comma separated list of languages.  Vim will use the first language
	for which the desired help can be found.  The English help will always
	be used as a last resort.  You can add "en" to prefer English over
	another language, but that will only find tags that exist in that
	language and not in the English help.
	Example: >
		:set helplang=de,it
<	This will first search German, then Italian and finally English help
	files.
	When using |CTRL-]| and ":help!" in a non-English help file Vim will
	try to find the tag in the current language before using this option.
	See |help-translated|.

				     *'hidden'* *'hid'* *'nohidden'* *'nohid'*
'hidden' 'hid'		boolean	(default off)
			global
			{not in Vi}
	When off a buffer is unloaded when it is |abandon|ed.  When on a
	buffer becomes hidden when it is |abandon|ed.  If the buffer is still
	displayed in another window, it does not become hidden, of course.
	The commands that move through the buffer list sometimes make a buffer
	hidden although the 'hidden' option is off: When the buffer is
	modified, 'autowrite' is off or writing is not possible, and the '!'
	flag was used.  See also |windows.txt|.
	To only make one buffer hidden use the 'bufhidden' option.
	This option is set for one command with ":hide {command}" |:hide|.
	WARNING: It's easy to forget that you have changes in hidden buffers.
	Think twice when using ":q!" or ":qa!".

						*'highlight'* *'hl'*
'highlight' 'hl'	string	(default (as a single string):
				     "8:SpecialKey,@:NonText,d:Directory,
				     e:ErrorMsg,i:IncSearch,l:Search,m:MoreMsg,
				     M:ModeMsg,n:LineNr,N:CursorLineNr,
				     r:Question,s:StatusLine,S:StatusLineNC,
				     c:VertSplit, t:Title,v:Visual,
				     w:WarningMsg,W:WildMenu,
				     f:Folded,F:FoldColumn,A:DiffAdd,
				     C:DiffChange,D:DiffDelete,T:DiffText,
				     >:SignColumn,B:SpellBad,P:SpellCap,
				     R:SpellRare,L:SpellLocal,-:Conceal,
				     +:Pmenu,=:PmenuSel,
				     x:PmenuSbar,X:PmenuThumb")
			global
			{not in Vi}
	This option can be used to set highlighting mode for various
	occasions.  It is a comma separated list of character pairs.  The
	first character in a pair gives the occasion, the second the mode to
	use for that occasion.  The occasions are:
	|hl-SpecialKey|	 8  Meta and special keys listed with ":map"
	|hl-NonText|	 @  '~' and '@' at the end of the window and
			    characters from 'showbreak'
	|hl-Directory|	 d  directories in CTRL-D listing and other special
			    things in listings
	|hl-ErrorMsg|	 e  error messages
			 h  (obsolete, ignored)
	|hl-IncSearch|	 i  'incsearch' highlighting
	|hl-Search|	 l  last search pattern highlighting (see 'hlsearch')
	|hl-MoreMsg|	 m  |more-prompt|
	|hl-ModeMsg|	 M  Mode (e.g., "-- INSERT --")
	|hl-LineNr|	 n  line number for ":number" and ":#" commands, and
			    when 'number' or 'relativenumber' option is set.
	|hl-CursorLineNr|  N like n for when 'cursorline' or 'relativenumber' is
			    set.
	|hl-Question|	 r  |hit-enter| prompt and yes/no questions
	|hl-StatusLine|	 s  status line of current window |status-line|
	|hl-StatusLineNC| S  status lines of not-current windows
	|hl-Title|	 t  Titles for output from ":set all", ":autocmd" etc.
	|hl-VertSplit|	 c  column used to separate vertically split windows
	|hl-Visual|	 v  Visual mode
	|hl-VisualNOS|	 V  Visual mode when Vim does is "Not Owning the
			    Selection" Only X11 Gui's |gui-x11| and
			    |xterm-clipboard|.
	|hl-WarningMsg|	 w  warning messages
	|hl-WildMenu|	 W  wildcard matches displayed for 'wildmenu'
	|hl-Folded|	 f  line used for closed folds
	|hl-FoldColumn|	 F  'foldcolumn'
	|hl-DiffAdd|	 A  added line in diff mode
	|hl-DiffChange|	 C  changed line in diff mode
	|hl-DiffDelete|	 D  deleted line in diff mode

	|hl-SpellRare|	 R  rare word |spell|
	|hl-SpellLocal|	 L  word from other region |spell|
	|hl-Conceal|	 -  the placeholders used for concealed characters
			    (see 'conceallevel')
	|hl-Pmenu|       +  popup menu normal line
	|hl-PmenuSel|    =  popup menu normal line
	|hl-PmenuSbar|   x  popup menu scrollbar
	|hl-PmenuThumb|  X  popup menu scrollbar thumb

	The display modes are:
		r	reverse		(termcap entry "mr" and "me")
		i	italic		(termcap entry "ZH" and "ZR")
		b	bold		(termcap entry "md" and "me")
		s	standout	(termcap entry "so" and "se")
		u	underline	(termcap entry "us" and "ue")
		c	undercurl	(termcap entry "Cs" and "Ce")
		n	no highlighting
		-	no highlighting
		:	use a highlight group
	The default is used for occasions that are not included.
	If you want to change what the display modes do, see |dos-colors|
	for an example.
	When using the ':' display mode, this must be followed by the name of
	a highlight group.  A highlight group can be used to define any type
	of highlighting, including using color.  See |:highlight| on how to
	define one.  The default uses a different group for each occasion.
	See |highlight-default| for the default highlight groups.

				 *'hlsearch'* *'hls'* *'nohlsearch'* *'nohls'*
'hlsearch' 'hls'	boolean	(default off)
			global
			{not in Vi}
			{not available when compiled without the
			|+extra_search| feature}
	When there is a previous search pattern, highlight all its matches.
	The type of highlighting used can be set with the 'l' occasion in the
	'highlight' option.  This uses the "Search" highlight group by
	default.  Note that only the matching text is highlighted, any offsets
	are not applied.
	See also: 'incsearch' and |:match|.
	When you get bored looking at the highlighted matches, you can turn it
	off with |:nohlsearch|.  This does not change the option value, as
	soon as you use a search command, the highlighting comes back.
	'redrawtime' specifies the maximum time spent on finding matches.
	When the search pattern can match an end-of-line, Vim will try to
	highlight all of the matched text.  However, this depends on where the
	search starts.  This will be the first line in the window or the first
	line below a closed fold.  A match in a previous line which is not
	drawn may not continue in a newly drawn line.
	You can specify whether the highlight status is restored on startup
	with the 'h' flag in 'viminfo' |viminfo-h|.
	NOTE: This option is reset when 'compatible' is set.

						*'history'* *'hi'*
'history' 'hi'		number	(Vim default: 50, Vi default: 0)
			global
			{not in Vi}
	A history of ":" commands, and a history of previous search patterns
	is remembered.  This option decides how many entries may be stored in
	each of these histories (see |cmdline-editing|).
	The maximum value is 10000.
	NOTE: This option is set to the Vi default value when 'compatible' is
	set and to the Vim default value when 'compatible' is reset.

					 *'hkmap'* *'hk'* *'nohkmap'* *'nohk'*
'hkmap' 'hk'		boolean (default off)
			global
			{not in Vi}
			{only available when compiled with the |+rightleft|
			feature}
	When on, the keyboard is mapped for the Hebrew character set.
	Normally you would set 'allowrevins' and use CTRL-_ in insert mode to
	toggle this option.  See |rileft.txt|.
	NOTE: This option is reset when 'compatible' is set.

				 *'hkmapp'* *'hkp'* *'nohkmapp'* *'nohkp'*
'hkmapp' 'hkp'		boolean (default off)
			global
			{not in Vi}
			{only available when compiled with the |+rightleft|
			feature}
	When on, phonetic keyboard mapping is used.  'hkmap' must also be on.
	This is useful if you have a non-Hebrew keyboard.
	See |rileft.txt|.
	NOTE: This option is reset when 'compatible' is set.

						*'icon'* *'noicon'*
'icon'			boolean	(default off, on when title can be restored)
			global
			{not in Vi}
			{not available when compiled without the |+title|
			feature}
	When on, the icon text of the window will be set to the value of
	'iconstring' (if it is not empty), or to the name of the file
	currently being edited.  Only the last part of the name is used.
	Overridden by the 'iconstring' option.
	Only works if the terminal supports setting window icons (currently
	only X11 GUI and terminals with a non-empty 't_IS' option - these are
	Unix xterm and iris-ansi by default, where 't_IS' is taken from the
	builtin termcap).
	When Vim was compiled with HAVE_X11 defined, the original icon will be
	restored if possible |X11|.  See |X11-icon| for changing the icon on
	X11.
	For MS-Windows the icon can be changed, see |windows-icon|.

						*'iconstring'*
'iconstring'		string	(default "")
			global
			{not in Vi}
			{not available when compiled without the |+title|
			feature}
	When this option is not empty, it will be used for the icon text of
	the window.  This happens only when the 'icon' option is on.
	Only works if the terminal supports setting window icon text
	(currently only X11 GUI and terminals with a non-empty 't_IS' option).
	Does not work for MS Windows.
	When Vim was compiled with HAVE_X11 defined, the original icon will be
	restored if possible |X11|.
	When this option contains printf-style '%' items, they will be
	expanded according to the rules used for 'statusline'.  See
	'titlestring' for example settings.
	{not available when compiled without the |+statusline| feature}

			*'ignorecase'* *'ic'* *'noignorecase'* *'noic'*
'ignorecase' 'ic'	boolean	(default off)
			global
	Ignore case in search patterns.  Also used when searching in the tags
	file.
	Also see 'smartcase'.
	Can be overruled by using "\c" or "\C" in the pattern, see
	|/ignorecase|.

						*'imactivatefunc'* *'imaf'*
'imactivatefunc' 'imaf'	string (default "")
			global
			{not in Vi}
			{only available when compiled with |+xim| and
			|+GUI_GTK|}
	This option specifies a function that will be called to
	activate/inactivate Input Method.

	Example: >
		function ImActivateFunc(active)
		  if a:active
		    ... do something
		  else
		    ... do something
		  endif
		  " return value is not used
		endfunction
		set imactivatefunc=ImActivateFunc
<
						*'imactivatekey'* *'imak'*
'imactivatekey' 'imak'	string (default "")
			global
			{not in Vi}
			{only available when compiled with |+xim| and
			|+GUI_GTK|}				*E599*
	Specifies the key that your Input Method in X-Windows uses for
	activation.  When this is specified correctly, vim can fully control
	IM with 'imcmdline', 'iminsert' and 'imsearch'.
	You can't use this option to change the activation key, the option
	tells Vim what the key is.
	Format:
		[MODIFIER_FLAG-]KEY_STRING

	These characters can be used for MODIFIER_FLAG (case is ignored):
		S	    Shift key
		L	    Lock key
		C	    Control key
		1	    Mod1 key
		2	    Mod2 key
		3	    Mod3 key
		4	    Mod4 key
		5	    Mod5 key
	Combinations are allowed, for example "S-C-space" or "SC-space" are
	both shift+ctrl+space.
	See <X11/keysymdef.h> and XStringToKeysym for KEY_STRING.

	Example: >
		:set imactivatekey=S-space
<	"S-space" means shift+space.  This is the activation key for kinput2 +
	canna (Japanese), and ami (Korean).

				*'imcmdline'* *'imc'* *'noimcmdline'* *'noimc'*
'imcmdline' 'imc'	boolean (default off)
			global
			{not in Vi}
			{only available when compiled with the |+xim|,
			|+multi_byte_ime| or |global-ime| features}
	When set the Input Method is always on when starting to edit a command
	line, unless entering a search pattern (see 'imsearch' for that).
	Setting this option is useful when your input method allows entering
	English characters directly, e.g., when it's used to type accented
	characters with dead keys.

				*'imdisable'* *'imd'* *'noimdisable'* *'noimd'*
'imdisable' 'imd'	boolean (default off, on for some systems (SGI))
			global
			{not in Vi}
			{only available when compiled with the |+xim|,
			|+multi_byte_ime| or |global-ime| features}
	When set the Input Method is never used.  This is useful to disable
	the IM when it doesn't work properly.
	Currently this option is on by default for SGI/IRIX machines.  This
	may change in later releases.

						*'iminsert'* *'imi'*
'iminsert' 'imi'	number (default 0, 2 when an input method is supported)
			local to buffer
			{not in Vi}
	Specifies whether :lmap or an Input Method (IM) is to be used in
	Insert mode.  Valid values:
		0	:lmap is off and IM is off
		1	:lmap is ON and IM is off
		2	:lmap is off and IM is ON
	2 is available only when compiled with the |+multi_byte_ime|, |+xim|
	or |global-ime|.
	To always reset the option to zero when leaving Insert mode with <Esc>
	this can be used: >
		:inoremap <ESC> <ESC>:set iminsert=0<CR>
<	This makes :lmap and IM turn off automatically when leaving Insert
	mode.
	Note that this option changes when using CTRL-^ in Insert mode
	|i_CTRL-^|.
	The value is set to 1 when setting 'keymap' to a valid keymap name.
	It is also used for the argument of commands like "r" and "f".
	The value 0 may not work correctly with Athena and Motif with some XIM
	methods.  Use 'imdisable' to disable XIM then.

						*'imsearch'* *'ims'*
'imsearch' 'ims'	number (default 0, 2 when an input method is supported)
			local to buffer
			{not in Vi}
	Specifies whether :lmap or an Input Method (IM) is to be used when
	entering a search pattern.  Valid values:
		-1	the value of 'iminsert' is used, makes it look like
			'iminsert' is also used when typing a search pattern
		0	:lmap is off and IM is off
		1	:lmap is ON and IM is off
		2	:lmap is off and IM is ON
	Note that this option changes when using CTRL-^ in Command-line mode
	|c_CTRL-^|.
	The value is set to 1 when it is not -1 and setting the 'keymap'
	option to a valid keymap name.
	The value 0 may not work correctly with Athena and Motif with some XIM
	methods.  Use 'imdisable' to disable XIM then.

						*'imstatusfunc'* *'imsf'*
'imstatusfunc' 'imsf'	string (default "")
			global
			{not in Vi}
			{only available when compiled with |+xim| and
			|+GUI_GTK|}
	This option specifies a function that is called to obtain the status
	of Input Method.  It must return a positive number when IME is active.

	Example: >
		function ImStatusFunc()
		  let is_active = ...do something
		  return is_active ? 1 : 0
		endfunction
		set imstatusfunc=ImStatusFunc
<
	NOTE: This function is invoked very often.  Keep it fast.

						*'include'* *'inc'*
'include' 'inc'		string	(default "^\s*#\s*include")
			global or local to buffer |global-local|
			{not in Vi}
			{not available when compiled without the
			|+find_in_path| feature}
	Pattern to be used to find an include command.  It is a search
	pattern, just like for the "/" command (See |pattern|).  The default
	value is for C programs.  This option is used for the commands "[i",
	"]I", "[d", etc.
	Normally the 'isfname' option is used to recognize the file name that
	comes after the matched pattern.  But if "\zs" appears in the pattern
	then the text matched from "\zs" to the end, or until "\ze" if it
	appears, is used as the file name.  Use this to include characters
	that are not in 'isfname', such as a space.  You can then use
	'includeexpr' to process the matched text.
	See |option-backslash| about including spaces and backslashes.

						*'includeexpr'* *'inex'*
'includeexpr' 'inex'	string	(default "")
			local to buffer
			{not in Vi}
			{not available when compiled without the
			|+find_in_path| or |+eval| features}
	Expression to be used to transform the string found with the 'include'
	option to a file name.  Mostly useful to change "." to "/" for Java: >
		:set includeexpr=substitute(v:fname,'\\.','/','g')
<	The "v:fname" variable will be set to the file name that was detected.

	Also used for the |gf| command if an unmodified file name can't be
	found.  Allows doing "gf" on the name after an 'include' statement.
	Also used for |<cfile>|.

	The expression will be evaluated in the |sandbox| when set from a
	modeline, see |sandbox-option|.

	It is not allowed to change text or jump to another window while
	evaluating 'includeexpr' |textlock|.

				 *'incsearch'* *'is'* *'noincsearch'* *'nois'*
'incsearch' 'is'	boolean	(default off)
			global
			{not in Vi}
			{not available when compiled without the
			|+extra_search| features}
	While typing a search command, show where the pattern, as it was typed
	so far, matches.  The matched string is highlighted.  If the pattern
	is invalid or not found, nothing is shown.  The screen will be updated
	often, this is only useful on fast terminals.
	Note that the match will be shown, but the cursor will return to its
	original position when no match is found and when pressing <Esc>.  You
	still need to finish the search command with <Enter> to move the
	cursor to the match.
	When compiled with the |+reltime| feature Vim only searches for about
	half a second.  With a complicated pattern and/or a lot of text the
	match may not be found.  This is to avoid that Vim hangs while you
	are typing the pattern.
	The highlighting can be set with the 'i' flag in 'highlight'.
	See also: 'hlsearch'.
	CTRL-L can be used to add one character from after the current match
	to the command line.  If 'ignorecase' and 'smartcase' are set and the
	command line has no uppercase characters, the added character is
	converted to lowercase.
	CTRL-R CTRL-W can be used to add the word at the end of the current
	match, excluding the characters that were already typed.
	NOTE: This option is reset when 'compatible' is set.

						*'indentexpr'* *'inde'*
'indentexpr' 'inde'	string	(default "")
			local to buffer
			{not in Vi}
			{not available when compiled without the |+cindent|
			or |+eval| features}
	Expression which is evaluated to obtain the proper indent for a line.
	It is used when a new line is created, for the |=| operator and
	in Insert mode as specified with the 'indentkeys' option.
	When this option is not empty, it overrules the 'cindent' and
	'smartindent' indenting.  When 'lisp' is set, this option is
	overridden by the Lisp indentation algorithm.
	When 'paste' is set this option is not used for indenting.
	The expression is evaluated with |v:lnum| set to the line number for
	which the indent is to be computed.  The cursor is also in this line
	when the expression is evaluated (but it may be moved around).
	The expression must return the number of spaces worth of indent.  It
	can return "-1" to keep the current indent (this means 'autoindent' is
	used for the indent).
	Functions useful for computing the indent are |indent()|, |cindent()|
	and |lispindent()|.
	The evaluation of the expression must not have side effects!  It must
	not change the text, jump to another window, etc.  Afterwards the
	cursor position is always restored, thus the cursor may be moved.
	Normally this option would be set to call a function: >
		:set indentexpr=GetMyIndent()
<	Error messages will be suppressed, unless the 'debug' option contains
	"msg".
	See |indent-expression|.
	NOTE: This option is made empty when 'compatible' is set.

	The expression will be evaluated in the |sandbox| when set from a
	modeline, see |sandbox-option|.

	It is not allowed to change text or jump to another window while
	evaluating 'indentexpr' |textlock|.


						*'indentkeys'* *'indk'*
'indentkeys' 'indk'	string	(default "0{,0},:,0#,!^F,o,O,e")
			local to buffer
			{not in Vi}
			{not available when compiled without the |+cindent|
			feature}
	A list of keys that, when typed in Insert mode, cause reindenting of
	the current line.  Only happens if 'indentexpr' isn't empty.
	The format is identical to 'cinkeys', see |indentkeys-format|.
	See |C-indenting| and |indent-expression|.

			*'infercase'* *'inf'* *'noinfercase'* *'noinf'*
'infercase' 'inf'	boolean	(default off)
			local to buffer
			{not in Vi}
	When doing keyword completion in insert mode |ins-completion|, and
	'ignorecase' is also on, the case of the match is adjusted depending
	on the typed text.  If the typed text contains a lowercase letter
	where the match has an upper case letter, the completed part is made
	lowercase.  If the typed text has no lowercase letters and the match
	has a lowercase letter where the typed text has an uppercase letter,
	and there is a letter before it, the completed part is made uppercase.
	With 'noinfercase' the match is used as-is.

			*'insertmode'* *'im'* *'noinsertmode'* *'noim'*
'insertmode' 'im'	boolean	(default off)
			global
			{not in Vi}
	Makes Vim work in a way that Insert mode is the default mode.  Useful
	if you want to use Vim as a modeless editor.  Used for |evim|.
	These Insert mode commands will be useful:
	- Use the cursor keys to move around.
	- Use CTRL-O to execute one Normal mode command |i_CTRL-O|).  When
	  this is a mapping, it is executed as if 'insertmode' was off.
	  Normal mode remains active until the mapping is finished.
	- Use CTRL-L to execute a number of Normal mode commands, then use
	  <Esc> to get back to Insert mode.  Note that CTRL-L moves the cursor
	  left, like <Esc> does when 'insertmode' isn't set.  |i_CTRL-L|

	These items change when 'insertmode' is set:
	- when starting to edit of a file, Vim goes to Insert mode.
	- <Esc> in Insert mode is a no-op and beeps.
	- <Esc> in Normal mode makes Vim go to Insert mode.
	- CTRL-L in Insert mode is a command, it is not inserted.
	- CTRL-Z in Insert mode suspends Vim, see |CTRL-Z|.	*i_CTRL-Z*
	However, when <Esc> is used inside a mapping, it behaves like
	'insertmode' was not set.  This was done to be able to use the same
	mappings with 'insertmode' set or not set.
	When executing commands with |:normal| 'insertmode' is not used.

	NOTE: This option is reset when 'compatible' is set.

						*'isfname'* *'isf'*
'isfname' 'isf'		string	(default for MS-DOS, Win32 and OS/2:
			     "@,48-57,/,\,.,-,_,+,,,#,$,%,{,},[,],:,@-@,!,~,="
			    for AMIGA: "@,48-57,/,.,-,_,+,,,$,:"
			    for VMS: "@,48-57,/,.,-,_,+,,,#,$,%,<,>,[,],:,;,~"
			    for OS/390: "@,240-249,/,.,-,_,+,,,#,$,%,~,="
			    otherwise: "@,48-57,/,.,-,_,+,,,#,$,%,~,=")
			global
			{not in Vi}
	The characters specified by this option are included in file names and
	path names.  Filenames are used for commands like "gf", "[i" and in
	the tags file.  It is also used for "\f" in a |pattern|.
	Multi-byte characters 256 and above are always included, only the
	characters up to 255 are specified with this option.
	For UTF-8 the characters 0xa0 to 0xff are included as well.
	Think twice before adding white space to this option.  Although a
	space may appear inside a file name, the effect will be that Vim
	doesn't know where a file name starts or ends when doing completion.
	It most likely works better without a space in 'isfname'.

	Note that on systems using a backslash as path separator, Vim tries to
	do its best to make it work as you would expect.  That is a bit
	tricky, since Vi originally used the backslash to escape special
	characters.  Vim will not remove a backslash in front of a normal file
	name character on these systems, but it will on Unix and alikes.  The
	'&' and '^' are not included by default, because these are special for
	cmd.exe.

	The format of this option is a list of parts, separated with commas.
	Each part can be a single character number or a range.  A range is two
	character numbers with '-' in between.  A character number can be a
	decimal number between 0 and 255 or the ASCII character itself (does
	not work for digits).  Example:
		"_,-,128-140,#-43"	(include '_' and '-' and the range
					128 to 140 and '#' to 43)
	If a part starts with '^', the following character number or range
	will be excluded from the option.  The option is interpreted from left
	to right.  Put the excluded character after the range where it is
	included.  To include '^' itself use it as the last character of the
	option or the end of a range.  Example:
		"^a-z,#,^"	(exclude 'a' to 'z', include '#' and '^')
	If the character is '@', all characters where isalpha() returns TRUE
	are included.  Normally these are the characters a to z and A to Z,
	plus accented characters.  To include '@' itself use "@-@".  Examples:
		"@,^a-z"	All alphabetic characters, excluding lower
				case ASCII letters.
		"a-z,A-Z,@-@"	All letters plus the '@' character.
	A comma can be included by using it where a character number is
	expected.  Example:
		"48-57,,,_"	Digits, comma and underscore.
	A comma can be excluded by prepending a '^'.  Example:
		" -~,^,,9"	All characters from space to '~', excluding
				comma, plus <Tab>.
	See |option-backslash| about including spaces and backslashes.

						*'isident'* *'isi'*
'isident' 'isi'		string	(default for MS-DOS, Win32 and OS/2:
					   "@,48-57,_,128-167,224-235"
				otherwise: "@,48-57,_,192-255")
			global
			{not in Vi}
	The characters given by this option are included in identifiers.
	Identifiers are used in recognizing environment variables and after a
	match of the 'define' option.  It is also used for "\i" in a
	|pattern|.  See 'isfname' for a description of the format of this
	option.
	Careful: If you change this option, it might break expanding
	environment variables.  E.g., when '/' is included and Vim tries to
	expand "$HOME/.viminfo".  Maybe you should change 'iskeyword' instead.

						*'iskeyword'* *'isk'*
'iskeyword' 'isk'	string (Vim default for MS-DOS and Win32:
					    "@,48-57,_,128-167,224-235"
				   otherwise:  "@,48-57,_,192-255"
				Vi default: "@,48-57,_")
			local to buffer
			{not in Vi}
	Keywords are used in searching and recognizing with many commands:
	"w", "*", "[i", etc.  It is also used for "\k" in a |pattern|.  See
	'isfname' for a description of the format of this option.  For C
	programs you could use "a-z,A-Z,48-57,_,.,-,>".
	For a help file it is set to all non-blank printable characters except
	'*', '"' and '|' (so that CTRL-] on a command finds the help for that
	command).
	When the 'lisp' option is on the '-' character is always included.
	NOTE: This option is set to the Vi default value when 'compatible' is
	set and to the Vim default value when 'compatible' is reset.

						*'isprint'* *'isp'*
'isprint' 'isp'	string	(default for MS-DOS, Win32, OS/2 and Macintosh:
				"@,~-255"; otherwise: "@,161-255")
			global
			{not in Vi}
	The characters given by this option are displayed directly on the
	screen.  It is also used for "\p" in a |pattern|.  The characters from
	space (ASCII 32) to '~' (ASCII 126) are always displayed directly,
	even when they are not included in 'isprint' or excluded.  See
	'isfname' for a description of the format of this option.

	Non-printable characters are displayed with two characters:
		  0 -  31	"^@" - "^_"
		 32 - 126	always single characters
		   127		"^?"
		128 - 159	"~@" - "~_"
		160 - 254	"| " - "|~"
		   255		"~?"
	When 'encoding' is a Unicode one, illegal bytes from 128 to 255 are
	displayed as <xx>, with the hexadecimal value of the byte.
	When 'display' contains "uhex" all unprintable characters are
	displayed as <xx>.
	The SpecialKey highlighting will be used for unprintable characters.
	|hl-SpecialKey|

	Multi-byte characters 256 and above are always included, only the
	characters up to 255 are specified with this option.  When a character
	is printable but it is not available in the current font, a
	replacement character will be shown.
	Unprintable and zero-width Unicode characters are displayed as <xxxx>.
	There is no option to specify these characters.

			*'joinspaces'* *'js'* *'nojoinspaces'* *'nojs'*
'joinspaces' 'js'	boolean	(default on)
			global
			{not in Vi}
	Insert two spaces after a '.', '?' and '!' with a join command.
	When 'cpoptions' includes the 'j' flag, only do this after a '.'.
	Otherwise only one space is inserted.
	NOTE: This option is set when 'compatible' is set.

							*'key'*
'key'			string	(default "")
			local to buffer
			{not in Vi}
			{only available when compiled with the |+cryptv|
			feature}
	The key that is used for encrypting and decrypting the current buffer.
	See |encryption| and 'cryptmethod'.
	Careful: Do not set the key value by hand, someone might see the typed
	key.  Use the |:X| command.  But you can make 'key' empty: >
		:set key=
<	It is not possible to get the value of this option with ":set key" or
	"echo &key".  This is to avoid showing it to someone who shouldn't
	know.  It also means you cannot see it yourself once you have set it,
	be careful not to make a typing error!
	You can use "&key" in an expression to detect whether encryption is
	enabled.  When 'key' is set it returns "*****" (five stars).

					*'keymap'* *'kmp'* *E544*
'keymap' 'kmp'		string	(default "")
			local to buffer
			{not in Vi}
			{only available when compiled with the |+keymap|
			feature}
	Name of a keyboard mapping.  See |mbyte-keymap|.
	Setting this option to a valid keymap name has the side effect of
	setting 'iminsert' to one, so that the keymap becomes effective.
	'imsearch' is also set to one, unless it was -1
	Only normal file name characters can be used, "/\*?[|<>" are illegal.

					*'keymodel'* *'km'*
'keymodel' 'km'		string	(default "")
			global
			{not in Vi}
	List of comma separated words, which enable special things that keys
	can do.  These values can be used:
	   startsel	Using a shifted special key starts selection (either
			Select mode or Visual mode, depending on "key" being
			present in 'selectmode').
	   stopsel	Using a not-shifted special key stops selection.
	Special keys in this context are the cursor keys, <End>, <Home>,
	<PageUp> and <PageDown>.
	The 'keymodel' option is set by the |:behave| command.

					*'keywordprg'* *'kp'*
'keywordprg' 'kp'	string	(default "man" or "man -s",  DOS: ":help",
						OS/2: "view /", VMS: "help")
			global or local to buffer |global-local|
			{not in Vi}
	Program to use for the |K| command.  Environment variables are
	expanded |:set_env|.  ":help" may be used to access the Vim internal
	help.  (Note that previously setting the global option to the empty
	value did this, which is now deprecated.)
	When "man" is used, Vim will automatically translate a count for the
	"K" command to a section number.  Also for "man -s", in which case the
	"-s" is removed when there is no count.
	See |option-backslash| about including spaces and backslashes.
	Example: >
		:set keywordprg=man\ -s
<	This option cannot be set from a |modeline| or in the |sandbox|, for
	security reasons.

					*'langmap'* *'lmap'* *E357* *E358*
'langmap' 'lmap'	string	(default "")
			global
			{not in Vi}
			{only available when compiled with the |+langmap|
			feature}
	This option allows switching your keyboard into a special language
	mode.  When you are typing text in Insert mode the characters are
	inserted directly.  When in command mode the 'langmap' option takes
	care of translating these special characters to the original meaning
	of the key.  This means you don't have to change the keyboard mode to
	be able to execute Normal mode commands.
	This is the opposite of the 'keymap' option, where characters are
	mapped in Insert mode.
	This option cannot be set from a |modeline| or in the |sandbox|, for
	security reasons.

	Example (for Greek, in UTF-8):				*greek*  >
	    :set langmap=ÎA,ÎB,Î¨C,ÎD,ÎE,Î¦F,ÎG,ÎH,ÎI,ÎJ,ÎK,ÎL,ÎM,ÎN,ÎO,Î P,QQ,Î¡R,Î£S,Î¤T,ÎU,Î©V,WW,Î§X,Î¥Y,ÎZ,Î±a,Î²b,Ïc,Î´d,Îµe,Ïf,Î³g,Î·h,Î¹i,Î¾j,Îºk,Î»l,Î¼m,Î½n,Î¿o,Ïp,qq,Ïr,Ïs,Ït,Î¸u,Ïv,Ïw,Ïx,Ïy,Î¶z
<	Example (exchanges meaning of z and y for commands): >
	    :set langmap=zy,yz,ZY,YZ
<
	The 'langmap' option is a list of parts, separated with commas.  Each
	part can be in one of two forms:
	1.  A list of pairs.  Each pair is a "from" character immediately
	    followed by the "to" character.  Examples: "aA", "aAbBcC".
	2.  A list of "from" characters, a semi-colon and a list of "to"
	    characters.  Example: "abc;ABC"
	Example: "aA,fgh;FGH,cCdDeE"
	Special characters need to be preceded with a backslash.  These are
	";", ',' and backslash itself.

	This will allow you to activate vim actions without having to switch
	back and forth between the languages.  Your language characters will
	be understood as normal vim English characters (according to the
	langmap mappings) in the following cases:
	 o Normal/Visual mode (commands, buffer/register names, user mappings)
	 o Insert/Replace Mode: Register names after CTRL-R
	 o Insert/Replace Mode: Mappings
	Characters entered in Command-line mode will NOT be affected by
	this option.   Note that this option can be changed at any time
	allowing to switch between mappings for different languages/encodings.
	Use a mapping to avoid having to type it each time!

					*'langmenu'* *'lm'*
'langmenu' 'lm'		string	(default "")
			global
			{not in Vi}
			{only available when compiled with the |+menu| and
			|+multi_lang| features}
	Language to use for menu translation.  Tells which file is loaded
	from the "lang" directory in 'runtimepath': >
		"lang/menu_" . &langmenu . ".vim"
<	(without the spaces).  For example, to always use the Dutch menus, no
	matter what $LANG is set to: >
		:set langmenu=nl_NL.ISO_8859-1
<	When 'langmenu' is empty, |v:lang| is used.
	Only normal file name characters can be used, "/\*?[|<>" are illegal.
	If your $LANG is set to a non-English language but you do want to use
	the English menus: >
		:set langmenu=none
<	This option must be set before loading menus, switching on filetype
	detection or syntax highlighting.  Once the menus are defined setting
	this option has no effect.  But you could do this: >
		:source $VIMRUNTIME/delmenu.vim
		:set langmenu=de_DE.ISO_8859-1
		:source $VIMRUNTIME/menu.vim
<	Warning: This deletes all menus that you defined yourself!

					*'laststatus'* *'ls'*
'laststatus' 'ls'	number	(default 1)
			global
			{not in Vi}
	The value of this option influences when the last window will have a
	status line:
		0: never
		1: only if there are at least two windows
		2: always
	The screen looks nicer with a status line if you have several
	windows, but it takes another screen line. |status-line|

			*'lazyredraw'* *'lz'* *'nolazyredraw'* *'nolz'*
'lazyredraw' 'lz'	boolean	(default off)
			global
			{not in Vi}
	When this option is set, the screen will not be redrawn while
	executing macros, registers and other commands that have not been
	typed.  Also, updating the window title is postponed.  To force an
	update use |:redraw|.

			*'linebreak'* *'lbr'* *'nolinebreak'* *'nolbr'*
'linebreak' 'lbr'	boolean	(default off)
			local to window
			{not in Vi}
			{not available when compiled without the |+linebreak|
			feature}
	If on, Vim will wrap long lines at a character in 'breakat' rather
	than at the last character that fits on the screen.  Unlike
	'wrapmargin' and 'textwidth', this does not insert <EOL>s in the file,
	it only affects the way the file is displayed, not its contents.
	If 'breakindent' is set, line is visually indented. Then, the value
	of 'showbreak' is used to put in front of wrapped lines. This option
	is not used when the 'wrap' option is off.
	Note that <Tab> characters after an <EOL> are mostly not displayed
	with the right amount of white space.

						*'lines'* *E593*
'lines'			number	(default 24 or terminal height)
			global
	Number of lines of the Vim window.
	Normally you don't need to set this.  It is done automatically by the
	terminal initialization code.  Also see |posix-screen-size|.
	When Vim is running in the GUI or in a resizable window, setting this
	option will cause the window size to be changed.  When you only want
	to use the size for the GUI, put the command in your |gvimrc| file.
	Vim limits the number of lines to what fits on the screen.  You can
	use this command to get the tallest window possible: >
		:set lines=999
<	Minimum value is 2, maximum value is 1000.
	If you get less lines than expected, check the 'guiheadroom' option.
	When you set this option and Vim is unable to change the physical
	number of lines of the display, the display may be messed up.

						*'linespace'* *'lsp'*
'linespace' 'lsp'	number	(default 0, 1 for Win32 GUI)
			global
			{not in Vi}
			{only in the GUI}
	Number of pixel lines inserted between characters.  Useful if the font
	uses the full character cell height, making lines touch each other.
	When non-zero there is room for underlining.
	With some fonts there can be too much room between lines (to have
	space for ascents and descents).  Then it makes sense to set
	'linespace' to a negative value.  This may cause display problems
	though!

						*'lisp'* *'nolisp'*
'lisp'			boolean	(default off)
			local to buffer
			{not available when compiled without the |+lispindent|
			feature}
	Lisp mode: When <Enter> is typed in insert mode set the indent for
	the next line to Lisp standards (well, sort of).  Also happens with
	"cc" or "S".  'autoindent' must also be on for this to work.  The 'p'
	flag in 'cpoptions' changes the method of indenting: Vi compatible or
	better.  Also see 'lispwords'.
	The '-' character is included in keyword characters.  Redefines the
	"=" operator to use this same indentation algorithm rather than
	calling an external program if 'equalprg' is empty.
	This option is not used when 'paste' is set.
	{Vi: Does it a little bit differently}

						*'lispwords'* *'lw'*
'lispwords' 'lw'	string	(default is very long)
			global or local to buffer |global-local|
			{not in Vi}
			{not available when compiled without the |+lispindent|
			feature}
	Comma separated list of words that influence the Lisp indenting.
	|'lisp'|

						*'list'* *'nolist'*
'list'			boolean	(default off)
			local to window
	List mode: Show tabs as CTRL-I is displayed, display $ after end of
	line.  Useful to see the difference between tabs and spaces and for
	trailing blanks.  Further changed by the 'listchars' option.

	The cursor is displayed at the start of the space a Tab character
	occupies, not at the end as usual in Normal mode.  To get this cursor
	position while displaying Tabs with spaces, use: >
		:set list lcs=tab:\ \ 
<
	Note that list mode will also affect formatting (set with 'textwidth'
	or 'wrapmargin') when 'cpoptions' includes 'L'.  See 'listchars' for
	changing the way tabs are displayed.

						*'listchars'* *'lcs'*
'listchars' 'lcs'	string	(default "eol:$")
			global
			{not in Vi}
	Strings to use in 'list' mode and for the |:list| command.  It is a
	comma separated list of string settings.
	  						*lcs-eol*
	  eol:c		Character to show at the end of each line.  When
			omitted, there is no extra character at the end of the
			line.
	  						*lcs-tab*
	  tab:xy	Two characters to be used to show a tab.  The first
			char is used once.  The second char is repeated to
			fill the space that the tab normally occupies.
			"tab:>-" will show a tab that takes four spaces as
			">---".  When omitted, a tab is show as ^I.
	  						*lcs-trail*
	  trail:c	Character to show for trailing spaces.  When omitted,
			trailing spaces are blank.
	  						*lcs-extends*
	  extends:c	Character to show in the last column, when 'wrap' is
			off and the line continues beyond the right of the
			screen.
	  						*lcs-precedes*
	  precedes:c	Character to show in the first column, when 'wrap'
			is off and there is text preceding the character
			visible in the first column.
	  						*lcs-conceal*
	  conceal:c	Character to show in place of concealed text, when
			'conceallevel' is set to 1.
	  						*lcs-nbsp*
	  nbsp:c	Character to show for a non-breakable space (character
			0xA0, 160).  Left blank when omitted.

	The characters ':' and ',' should not be used.  UTF-8 characters can
	be used when 'encoding' is "utf-8", otherwise only printable
	characters are allowed.  All characters must be single width.

	Examples: >
	    :set lcs=tab:>-,trail:-
	    :set lcs=tab:>-,eol:<,nbsp:%
	    :set lcs=extends:>,precedes:<
<	The "NonText" highlighting will be used for "eol", "extends" and
	"precedes".  "SpecialKey" for "nbsp", "tab" and "trail".
	|hl-NonText| |hl-SpecialKey|

			*'lpl'* *'nolpl'* *'loadplugins'* *'noloadplugins'*
'loadplugins' 'lpl'	boolean	(default on)
			global
			{not in Vi}
	When on the plugin scripts are loaded when starting up |load-plugins|.
	This option can be reset in your |vimrc| file to disable the loading
	of plugins.
	Note that using the "-u NONE" and "--noplugin" command line arguments
	reset this option. |-u| |--noplugin|

						*'macatsui'* *'nomacatsui'*
'macatsui'		boolean	(default on)
			global
			{only available in Mac GUI version}
	This is a workaround for when drawing doesn't work properly.  When set
	and compiled with multi-byte support ATSUI text drawing is used.  When
	not set ATSUI text drawing is not used.  Switch this option off when
	you experience drawing problems.  In a future version the problems may
	be solved and this option becomes obsolete.  Therefore use this method
	to unset it: >
		if exists('&macatsui')
		   set nomacatsui
		endif
<	Another option to check if you have drawing problems is
	'termencoding'.

						*'magic'* *'nomagic'*
'magic'			boolean	(default on)
			global
	Changes the special characters that can be used in search patterns.
	See |pattern|.
	NOTE: To avoid portability problems with using patterns, always keep
	this option at the default "on".  Only switch it off when working with
	old Vi scripts.  In any other situation write patterns that work when
	'magic' is on.  Include "\M" when you want to |/\M|.

						*'makeef'* *'mef'*
'makeef' 'mef'		string	(default: "")
			global
			{not in Vi}
			{not available when compiled without the |+quickfix|
			feature}
	Name of the errorfile for the |:make| command (see |:make_makeprg|)
	and the |:grep| command.
	When it is empty, an internally generated temp file will be used.
	When "##" is included, it is replaced by a number to make the name
	unique.  This makes sure that the ":make" command doesn't overwrite an
	existing file.
	NOT used for the ":cf" command.  See 'errorfile' for that.
	Environment variables are expanded |:set_env|.
	See |option-backslash| about including spaces and backslashes.
	This option cannot be set from a |modeline| or in the |sandbox|, for
	security reasons.

						*'makeprg'* *'mp'*
'makeprg' 'mp'		string	(default "make", VMS: "MMS")
			global or local to buffer |global-local|
			{not in Vi}
	Program to use for the ":make" command.  See |:make_makeprg|.
	This option may contain '%' and '#' characters (see  |:_%| and |:_#|), 
	which are expanded to the current and alternate file name.  Use |::S| 
	to escape file names in case they contain special characters.
	Environment variables are expanded |:set_env|.  See |option-backslash|
	about including spaces and backslashes.
	Note that a '|' must be escaped twice: once for ":set" and once for
	the interpretation of a command.  When you use a filter called
	"myfilter" do it like this: >
	    :set makeprg=gmake\ \\\|\ myfilter
<	The placeholder "$*" can be given (even multiple times) to specify
	where the arguments will be included, for example: >
	    :set makeprg=latex\ \\\\nonstopmode\ \\\\input\\{$*}
<	This option cannot be set from a |modeline| or in the |sandbox|, for
	security reasons.

						*'matchpairs'* *'mps'*
'matchpairs' 'mps'	string	(default "(:),{:},[:]")
			local to buffer
			{not in Vi}
	Characters that form pairs.  The |%| command jumps from one to the
	other.
	Only character pairs are allowed that are different, thus you cannot
	jump between two double quotes.
	The characters must be separated by a colon.
	The pairs must be separated by a comma.  Example for including '<' and
	'>' (HTML): >
		:set mps+=<:>

<	A more exotic example, to jump between the '=' and ';' in an
	assignment, useful for languages like C and Java: >
		:au FileType c,cpp,java set mps+==:;

<	For a more advanced way of using "%", see the matchit.vim plugin in
	the $VIMRUNTIME/macros directory. |add-local-help|

						*'matchtime'* *'mat'*
'matchtime' 'mat'	number	(default 5)
			global
			{not in Vi}{in Nvi}
	Tenths of a second to show the matching paren, when 'showmatch' is
	set.  Note that this is not in milliseconds, like other options that
	set a time.  This is to be compatible with Nvi.

						*'maxcombine'* *'mco'*
'maxcombine' 'mco'	number (default 2)
			global
			{not in Vi}
			{only available when compiled with the |+multi_byte|
			feature}
	The maximum number of combining characters supported for displaying.
	Only used when 'encoding' is "utf-8".
	The default is OK for most languages.  Hebrew may require 4.
	Maximum value is 6.
	Even when this option is set to 2 you can still edit text with more
	combining characters, you just can't see them.  Use |g8| or |ga|.
	See |mbyte-combining|.

						*'maxfuncdepth'* *'mfd'*
'maxfuncdepth' 'mfd'	number	(default 100)
			global
			{not in Vi}
			{not available when compiled without the |+eval|
			feature}
	Maximum depth of function calls for user functions.  This normally
	catches endless recursion.  When using a recursive function with
	more depth, set 'maxfuncdepth' to a bigger number.  But this will use
	more memory, there is the danger of failing when memory is exhausted.
	See also |:function|.

						*'maxmapdepth'* *'mmd'* *E223*
'maxmapdepth' 'mmd'	number	(default 1000)
			global
			{not in Vi}
	Maximum number of times a mapping is done without resulting in a
	character to be used.  This normally catches endless mappings, like
	":map x y" with ":map y x".  It still does not catch ":map g wg",
	because the 'w' is used before the next mapping is done.  See also
	|key-mapping|.

						*'maxmem'* *'mm'*
'maxmem' 'mm'		number	(default between 256 to 5120 (system
				 dependent) or half the amount of memory
				 available)
			global
			{not in Vi}
	Maximum amount of memory (in Kbyte) to use for one buffer.  When this
	limit is reached allocating extra memory for a buffer will cause
	other memory to be freed.  The maximum usable value is about 2000000.
	Use this to work without a limit.  Also see 'maxmemtot'.

						*'maxmempattern'* *'mmp'*
'maxmempattern' 'mmp'	number	(default 1000)
			global
			{not in Vi}
	Maximum amount of memory (in Kbyte) to use for pattern matching.
	The maximum value is about 2000000.  Use this to work without a limit.
							*E363*
	When Vim runs into the limit it gives an error message and mostly
	behaves like CTRL-C was typed.
	Running into the limit often means that the pattern is very
	inefficient or too complex.  This may already happen with the pattern
	"\(.\)*" on a very long line.  ".*" works much better.
	Vim may run out of memory before hitting the 'maxmempattern' limit.

						*'maxmemtot'* *'mmt'*
'maxmemtot' 'mmt'	number	(default between 2048 and 10240 (system
				 dependent) or half the amount of memory
				 available)
			global
			{not in Vi}
	Maximum amount of memory in Kbyte to use for all buffers together.
	The maximum usable value is about 2000000 (2 Gbyte).  Use this to work
	without a limit.  On 64 bit machines higher values might work.  But
	hey, do you really need more than 2 Gbyte for text editing?
	Also see 'maxmem'.

						*'menuitems'* *'mis'*
'menuitems' 'mis'	number	(default 25)
			global
			{not in Vi}
			{not available when compiled without the |+menu|
			feature}
	Maximum number of items to use in a menu.  Used for menus that are
	generated from a list of items, e.g., the Buffers menu.  Changing this
	option has no direct effect, the menu must be refreshed first.

						*'mkspellmem'* *'msm'*
'mkspellmem' 'msm'	string	(default "460000,2000,500")
			global
			{not in Vi}
			{not available when compiled without the |+syntax|
			feature}
	Parameters for |:mkspell|.  This tunes when to start compressing the
	word tree.  Compression can be slow when there are many words, but
	it's needed to avoid running out of memory.  The amount of memory used
	per word depends very much on how similar the words are, that's why
	this tuning is complicated.

	There are three numbers, separated by commas:
		{start},{inc},{added}

	For most languages the uncompressed word tree fits in memory.  {start}
	gives the amount of memory in Kbyte that can be used before any
	compression is done.  It should be a bit smaller than the amount of
	memory that is available to Vim.

	When going over the {start} limit the {inc} number specifies the
	amount of memory in Kbyte that can be allocated before another
	compression is done.  A low number means compression is done after
	less words are added, which is slow.  A high number means more memory
	will be allocated.

	After doing compression, {added} times 1024 words can be added before
	the {inc} limit is ignored and compression is done when any extra
	amount of memory is needed.  A low number means there is a smaller
	chance of hitting the {inc} limit, less memory is used but it's
	slower.

	The languages for which these numbers are important are Italian and
	Hungarian.  The default works for when you have about 512 Mbyte.  If
	you have 1 Gbyte you could use: >
		:set mkspellmem=900000,3000,800
<	If you have less than 512 Mbyte |:mkspell| may fail for some
	languages, no matter what you set 'mkspellmem' to.

				   *'modeline'* *'ml'* *'nomodeline'* *'noml'*
'modeline' 'ml'		boolean	(Vim default: on (off for root),
				 Debian: off, Vi default: off)
			local to buffer
						*'modelines'* *'mls'*
'modelines' 'mls'	number	(default 5)
			global
			{not in Vi}
	If 'modeline' is on 'modelines' gives the number of lines that is
	checked for set commands.  If 'modeline' is off or 'modelines' is zero
	no lines are checked.  See |modeline|.
	NOTE: 'modeline' is set to the Vi default value when 'compatible' is
	set and to the Vim default value when 'compatible' is reset.

				*'modifiable'* *'ma'* *'nomodifiable'* *'noma'*
'modifiable' 'ma'	boolean	(default on)
			local to buffer
			{not in Vi}		*E21*
	When off the buffer contents cannot be changed.  The 'fileformat' and
	'fileencoding' options also can't be changed.
	Can be reset with the |-M| command line argument.

				*'modified'* *'mod'* *'nomodified'* *'nomod'*
'modified' 'mod'	boolean	(default off)
			local to buffer
			{not in Vi}
	When on, the buffer is considered to be modified.  This option is set
	when:
	1. A change was made to the text since it was last written.  Using the
	   |undo| command to go back to the original text will reset the
	   option.  But undoing changes that were made before writing the
	   buffer will set the option again, since the text is different from
	   when it was written.
	2. 'fileformat' or 'fileencoding' is different from its original
	   value.  The original value is set when the buffer is read or
	   written.  A ":set nomodified" command also resets the original
	   values to the current values and the 'modified' option will be
	   reset.
	This option is not set when a change is made to the buffer as the
	result of a BufNewFile, BufRead/BufReadPost, BufWritePost,
	FileAppendPost or VimLeave autocommand event.  See |gzip-example| for
	an explanation.
	When 'buftype' is "nowrite" or "nofile" this option may be set, but
	will be ignored.

						*'more'* *'nomore'*
'more'			boolean	(Vim default: on, Vi default: off)
			global
			{not in Vi}
	When on, listings pause when the whole screen is filled.  You will get
	the |more-prompt|.  When this option is off there are no pauses, the
	listing continues until finished.
	NOTE: This option is set to the Vi default value when 'compatible' is
	set and to the Vim default value when 'compatible' is reset.

						*'mouse'* *E538*
'mouse'			string	(default "", "a" for GUI, MS-DOS and Win32)
			global
			{not in Vi}
	Enable the use of the mouse.  Only works for certain terminals
	(xterm, MS-DOS, Win32 |win32-mouse|, QNX pterm, *BSD console with
	sysmouse and Linux console with gpm).  For using the mouse in the
	GUI, see |gui-mouse|.
	The mouse can be enabled for different modes:
		n	Normal mode
		v	Visual mode
		i	Insert mode
		c	Command-line mode
		h	all previous modes when editing a help file
		a	all previous modes
		r	for |hit-enter| and |more-prompt| prompt
	Normally you would enable the mouse in all four modes with: >
		:set mouse=a
<	When the mouse is not enabled, the GUI will still use the mouse for
	modeless selection.  This doesn't move the text cursor.

	See |mouse-using|.  Also see |'clipboard'|.

	Note: When enabling the mouse in a terminal, copy/paste will use the
	"* register if there is access to an X-server.  The xterm handling of
	the mouse buttons can still be used by keeping the shift key pressed.
	Also see the 'clipboard' option.

			*'mousefocus'* *'mousef'* *'nomousefocus'* *'nomousef'*
'mousefocus' 'mousef'	boolean	(default off)
			global
			{not in Vi}
			{only works in the GUI}
	The window that the mouse pointer is on is automatically activated.
	When changing the window layout or window focus in another way, the
	mouse pointer is moved to the window with keyboard focus.  Off is the
	default because it makes using the pull down menus a little goofy, as
	a pointer transit may activate a window unintentionally.

			*'mousehide'* *'mh'* *'nomousehide'* *'nomh'*
'mousehide' 'mh'	boolean	(default on)
			global
			{not in Vi}
			{only works in the GUI}
	When on, the mouse pointer is hidden when characters are typed.
	The mouse pointer is restored when the mouse is moved.

						*'mousemodel'* *'mousem'*
'mousemodel' 'mousem'	string	(default "extend", "popup" for MS-DOS and Win32)
			global
			{not in Vi}
	Sets the model to use for the mouse.  The name mostly specifies what
	the right mouse button is used for:
	   extend	Right mouse button extends a selection.  This works
			like in an xterm.
	   popup	Right mouse button pops up a menu.  The shifted left
			mouse button extends a selection.  This works like
			with Microsoft Windows.
	   popup_setpos Like "popup", but the cursor will be moved to the
			position where the mouse was clicked, and thus the
			selected operation will act upon the clicked object.
			If clicking inside a selection, that selection will
			be acted upon, i.e. no cursor move.  This implies of
			course, that right clicking outside a selection will
			end Visual mode.
	Overview of what button does what for each model:
	mouse		    extend		popup(_setpos) ~
	left click	    place cursor	place cursor
	left drag	    start selection	start selection
	shift-left	    search word		extend selection
	right click	    extend selection	popup menu (place cursor)
	right drag	    extend selection	-
	middle click	    paste		paste

	In the "popup" model the right mouse button produces a pop-up menu.
	You need to define this first, see |popup-menu|.

	Note that you can further refine the meaning of buttons with mappings.
	See |gui-mouse-mapping|.  But mappings are NOT used for modeless
	selection (because that's handled in the GUI code directly).

	The 'mousemodel' option is set by the |:behave| command.

					*'mouseshape'* *'mouses'* *E547*
'mouseshape' 'mouses'	string	(default "i:beam,r:beam,s:updown,sd:cross,
					m:no,ml:up-arrow,v:rightup-arrow")
			global
			{not in Vi}
			{only available when compiled with the |+mouseshape|
			feature}
	This option tells Vim what the mouse pointer should look like in
	different modes.  The option is a comma separated list of parts, much
	like used for 'guicursor'.  Each part consist of a mode/location-list
	and an argument-list:
		mode-list:shape,mode-list:shape,..
	The mode-list is a dash separated list of these modes/locations:
			In a normal window: ~
		n	Normal mode
		v	Visual mode
		ve	Visual mode with 'selection' "exclusive" (same as 'v',
			if not specified)
		o	Operator-pending mode
		i	Insert mode
		r	Replace mode

			Others: ~
		c	appending to the command-line
		ci	inserting in the command-line
		cr	replacing in the command-line
		m	at the 'Hit ENTER' or 'More' prompts
		ml	idem, but cursor in the last line
		e	any mode, pointer below last window
		s	any mode, pointer on a status line
		sd	any mode, while dragging a status line
		vs	any mode, pointer on a vertical separator line
		vd	any mode, while dragging a vertical separator line
		a	everywhere

	The shape is one of the following:
	avail	name		looks like ~
	w x	arrow		Normal mouse pointer
	w x	blank		no pointer at all (use with care!)
	w x	beam		I-beam
	w x	updown		up-down sizing arrows
	w x	leftright	left-right sizing arrows
	w x	busy		The system's usual busy pointer
	w x	no		The system's usual 'no input' pointer
	  x	udsizing	indicates up-down resizing
	  x	lrsizing	indicates left-right resizing
	  x	crosshair	like a big thin +
	  x	hand1		black hand
	  x	hand2		white hand
	  x	pencil		what you write with
	  x	question	big ?
	  x	rightup-arrow	arrow pointing right-up
	w x	up-arrow	arrow pointing up
	  x	<number>	any X11 pointer number (see X11/cursorfont.h)

	The "avail" column contains a 'w' if the shape is available for Win32,
	x for X11.
	Any modes not specified or shapes not available use the normal mouse
	pointer.

	Example: >
		:set mouseshape=s:udsizing,m:no
<	will make the mouse turn to a sizing arrow over the status lines and
	indicate no input when the hit-enter prompt is displayed (since
	clicking the mouse has no effect in this state.)

						*'mousetime'* *'mouset'*
'mousetime' 'mouset'	number	(default 500)
			global
			{not in Vi}
	Only for GUI, MS-DOS, Win32 and Unix with xterm.  Defines the maximum
	time in msec between two mouse clicks for the second click to be
	recognized as a multi click.

						    *'mzquantum'* *'mzq'*
'mzquantum' 'mzq'	number	(default 100)
			global
			{not in Vi}
			{not available when compiled without the |+mzscheme|
			feature}
	The number of milliseconds between polls for MzScheme threads.
	Negative or zero value means no thread scheduling.

							*'nrformats'* *'nf'*
'nrformats' 'nf'	string	(default "octal,hex")
			local to buffer
			{not in Vi}
	This defines what bases Vim will consider for numbers when using the
	CTRL-A and CTRL-X commands for adding to and subtracting from a number
	respectively; see |CTRL-A| for more info on these commands.
	alpha	If included, single alphabetical characters will be
		incremented or decremented.  This is useful for a list with a
		letter index a), b), etc.	  	*octal-nrformats*
	octal	If included, numbers that start with a zero will be considered
		to be octal.  Example: Using CTRL-A on "007" results in "010".
	hex	If included, numbers starting with "0x" or "0X" will be
		considered to be hexadecimal.  Example: Using CTRL-X on
		"0x100" results in "0x0ff".
	Numbers which simply begin with a digit in the range 1-9 are always
	considered decimal.  This also happens for numbers that are not
	recognized as octal or hex.

				*'number'* *'nu'* *'nonumber'* *'nonu'*
'number' 'nu'		boolean	(default off)
			local to window
	Print the line number in front of each line.  When the 'n' option is
	excluded from 'cpoptions' a wrapped line will not use the column of
	line numbers (this is the default when 'compatible' isn't set).
	The 'numberwidth' option can be used to set the room used for the line
	number.
	When a long, wrapped line doesn't start with the first character, '-'
	characters are put before the number.
	See |hl-LineNr|  and |hl-CursorLineNr| for the highlighting used for
	the number.
						*number_relativenumber*
	The 'relativenumber' option changes the displayed number to be
	relative to the cursor.  Together with 'number' there are these
	four combinations (cursor in line 3):

              	'nonu'          'nu'            'nonu'          'nu'
		'nornu'         'nornu'         'rnu'           'rnu'

	    |apple          |  1 apple      |  2 apple      |  2 apple
	    |pear           |  2 pear       |  1 pear       |  1 pear
	    |nobody         |  3 nobody     |  0 nobody     |3   nobody
	    |there          |  4 there      |  1 there      |  1 there

						*'numberwidth'* *'nuw'*
'numberwidth' 'nuw'	number	(Vim default: 4  Vi default: 8)
			local to window
			{not in Vi}
			{only available when compiled with the |+linebreak|
			feature}
	Minimal number of columns to use for the line number.  Only relevant
	when the 'number' or 'relativenumber' option is set or printing lines
	with a line number. Since one space is always between the number and
	the text, there is one less character for the number itself.
	The value is the minimum width.  A bigger width is used when needed to
	fit the highest line number in the buffer respectively the number of
	rows in the window, depending on whether 'number' or 'relativenumber'
	is set. Thus with the Vim default of 4 there is room for a line number
	up to 999. When the buffer has 1000 lines five columns will be used.
	The minimum value is 1, the maximum value is 10.
	NOTE: 'numberwidth' is reset to 8 when 'compatible' is set.

						*'omnifunc'* *'ofu'*
'omnifunc' 'ofu'	string	(default: empty)
			local to buffer
			{not in Vi}
			{not available when compiled without the |+eval|
			or |+insert_expand| features}
	This option specifies a function to be used for Insert mode omni
	completion with CTRL-X CTRL-O. |i_CTRL-X_CTRL-O|
	See |complete-functions| for an explanation of how the function is
	invoked and what it should return.
	This option is usually set by a filetype plugin:
	|:filetype-plugin-on|
	This option cannot be set from a |modeline| or in the |sandbox|, for
	security reasons.


			    *'opendevice'* *'odev'* *'noopendevice'* *'noodev'*
'opendevice' 'odev'	boolean	(default off)
			global
			{not in Vi}
			{only for MS-DOS, MS-Windows and OS/2}
	Enable reading and writing from devices.  This may get Vim stuck on a
	device that can be opened but doesn't actually do the I/O.  Therefore
	it is off by default.
	Note that on MS-Windows editing "aux.h", "lpt1.txt" and the like also
	result in editing a device.


						*'operatorfunc'* *'opfunc'*
'operatorfunc' 'opfunc'	string	(default: empty)
			global
			{not in Vi}
	This option specifies a function to be called by the |g@| operator.
	See |:map-operator| for more info and an example.

	This option cannot be set from a |modeline| or in the |sandbox|, for
	security reasons.


					*'osfiletype'* *'oft'*
'osfiletype' 'oft'	string (default: "")
			local to buffer
			{not in Vi}
	This option was supported on RISC OS, which has been removed.


						*'paragraphs'* *'para'*
'paragraphs' 'para'	string	(default "IPLPPPQPP TPHPLIPpLpItpplpipbp")
			global
	Specifies the nroff macros that separate paragraphs.  These are pairs
	of two letters (see |object-motions|).

						*'paste'* *'nopaste'*
'paste'			boolean	(default off)
			global
			{not in Vi}
	Put Vim in Paste mode.  This is useful if you want to cut or copy
	some text from one window and paste it in Vim.  This will avoid
	unexpected effects.
	Setting this option is useful when using Vim in a terminal, where Vim
	cannot distinguish between typed text and pasted text.  In the GUI, Vim
	knows about pasting and will mostly do the right thing without 'paste'
	being set.  The same is true for a terminal where Vim handles the
	mouse clicks itself.
	This option is reset when starting the GUI.  Thus if you set it in
	your .vimrc it will work in a terminal, but not in the GUI.  Setting
	'paste' in the GUI has side effects: e.g., the Paste toolbar button
	will no longer work in Insert mode, because it uses a mapping.
	When the 'paste' option is switched on (also when it was already on):
		- mapping in Insert mode and Command-line mode is disabled
		- abbreviations are disabled
		- 'textwidth' is set to 0
		- 'wrapmargin' is set to 0
		- 'autoindent' is reset
		- 'smartindent' is reset
		- 'softtabstop' is set to 0
		- 'revins' is reset
		- 'ruler' is reset
		- 'showmatch' is reset
		- 'formatoptions' is used like it is empty
	These options keep their value, but their effect is disabled:
		- 'lisp'
		- 'indentexpr'
		- 'cindent'
	NOTE: When you start editing another file while the 'paste' option is
	on, settings from the modelines or autocommands may change the
	settings again, causing trouble when pasting text.  You might want to
	set the 'paste' option again.
	When the 'paste' option is reset the mentioned options are restored to
	the value before the moment 'paste' was switched from off to on.
	Resetting 'paste' before ever setting it does not have any effect.
	Since mapping doesn't work while 'paste' is active, you need to use
	the 'pastetoggle' option to toggle the 'paste' option with some key.

						*'pastetoggle'* *'pt'*
'pastetoggle' 'pt'	string	(default "")
			global
			{not in Vi}
	When non-empty, specifies the key sequence that toggles the 'paste'
	option.  This is like specifying a mapping: >
	    :map {keys} :set invpaste<CR>
<	Where {keys} is the value of 'pastetoggle'.
	The difference is that it will work even when 'paste' is set.
	'pastetoggle' works in Insert mode and Normal mode, but not in
	Command-line mode.
	Mappings are checked first, thus overrule 'pastetoggle'.  However,
	when 'paste' is on mappings are ignored in Insert mode, thus you can do
	this: >
	    :map <F10> :set paste<CR>
	    :map <F11> :set nopaste<CR>
	    :imap <F10> <C-O>:set paste<CR>
	    :imap <F11> <nop>
	    :set pastetoggle=<F11>
<	This will make <F10> start paste mode and <F11> stop paste mode.
	Note that typing <F10> in paste mode inserts "<F10>", since in paste
	mode everything is inserted literally, except the 'pastetoggle' key
	sequence.
	When the value has several bytes 'ttimeoutlen' applies.

						*'pex'* *'patchexpr'*
'patchexpr' 'pex'	string	(default "")
			global
			{not in Vi}
			{not available when compiled without the |+diff|
			feature}
	Expression which is evaluated to apply a patch to a file and generate
	the resulting new version of the file.  See |diff-patchexpr|.

					*'patchmode'* *'pm'* *E205* *E206*
'patchmode' 'pm'	string	(default "")
			global
			{not in Vi}
	When non-empty the oldest version of a file is kept.  This can be used
	to keep the original version of a file if you are changing files in a
	source distribution.  Only the first time that a file is written a
	copy of the original file will be kept.  The name of the copy is the
	name of the original file with the string in the 'patchmode' option
	appended.  This option should start with a dot.  Use a string like
	".org".  'backupdir' must not be empty for this to work (Detail: The
	backup file is renamed to the patchmode file after the new file has
	been successfully written, that's why it must be possible to write a
	backup file).  If there was no file to be backed up, an empty file is
	created.
	When the 'backupskip' pattern matches, a patchmode file is not made.
	Using 'patchmode' for compressed files appends the extension at the
	end (e.g., "file.gz.orig"), thus the resulting name isn't always
	recognized as a compressed file.
	Only normal file name characters can be used, "/\*?[|<>" are illegal.

				*'path'* *'pa'* *E343* *E345* *E347* *E854*
'path' 'pa'		string	(default on Unix: ".,/usr/include,,"
				   on OS/2:	  ".,/emx/include,,"
				   other systems: ".,,")
			global or local to buffer |global-local|
			{not in Vi}
	This is a list of directories which will be searched when using the
	|gf|, [f, ]f, ^Wf, |:find|, |:sfind|, |:tabfind| and other commands,
	provided that the file being searched for has a relative path (not
	starting with "/", "./" or "../").  The directories in the 'path'
	option may be relative or absolute.
	- Use commas to separate directory names: >
		:set path=.,/usr/local/include,/usr/include
<	- Spaces can also be used to separate directory names (for backwards
	  compatibility with version 3.0).  To have a space in a directory
	  name, precede it with an extra backslash, and escape the space: >
		:set path=.,/dir/with\\\ space
<	- To include a comma in a directory name precede it with an extra
	  backslash: >
		:set path=.,/dir/with\\,comma
<	- To search relative to the directory of the current file, use: >
		:set path=.
<	- To search in the current directory use an empty string between two
	  commas: >
		:set path=,,
<	- A directory name may end in a ':' or '/'.
	- Environment variables are expanded |:set_env|.
	- When using |netrw.vim| URLs can be used.  For example, adding
	  "http://www.vim.org" will make ":find index.html" work.
	- Search upwards and downwards in a directory tree using "*", "**" and
	  ";".  See |file-searching| for info and syntax.
	  {not available when compiled without the |+path_extra| feature}
	- Careful with '\' characters, type two to get one in the option: >
		:set path=.,c:\\include
<	  Or just use '/' instead: >
		:set path=.,c:/include
<	Don't forget "." or files won't even be found in the same directory as
	the file!
	The maximum length is limited.  How much depends on the system, mostly
	it is something like 256 or 1024 characters.
	You can check if all the include files are found, using the value of
	'path', see |:checkpath|.
	The use of |:set+=| and |:set-=| is preferred when adding or removing
	directories from the list.  This avoids problems when a future version
	uses another default.  To remove the current directory use: >
		:set path-=
<	To add the current directory use: >
		:set path+=
<	To use an environment variable, you probably need to replace the
	separator.  Here is an example to append $INCL, in which directory
	names are separated with a semi-colon: >
		:let &path = &path . "," . substitute($INCL, ';', ',', 'g')
<	Replace the ';' with a ':' or whatever separator is used.  Note that
	this doesn't work when $INCL contains a comma or white space.

			*'preserveindent'* *'pi'* *'nopreserveindent'* *'nopi'*
'preserveindent' 'pi'	boolean	(default off)
			local to buffer
			{not in Vi}
	When changing the indent of the current line, preserve as much of the
	indent structure as possible.  Normally the indent is replaced by a
	series of tabs followed by spaces as required (unless |'expandtab'| is
	enabled, in which case only spaces are used).  Enabling this option
	means the indent will preserve as many existing characters as possible
	for indenting, and only add additional tabs or spaces as required.
	'expandtab' does not apply to the preserved white space, a Tab remains
	a Tab.
	NOTE: When using ">>" multiple times the resulting indent is a mix of
	tabs and spaces.  You might not like this.
	NOTE: 'preserveindent' is reset when 'compatible' is set.
	Also see 'copyindent'.
	Use |:retab| to clean up white space.

					*'previewheight'* *'pvh'*
'previewheight' 'pvh'	number (default 12)
			global
			{not in Vi}
			{not available when compiled without the |+windows| or
			|+quickfix| features}
	Default height for a preview window.  Used for |:ptag| and associated
	commands.  Used for |CTRL-W_}| when no count is given.

					*'previewwindow'* *'nopreviewwindow'*
					*'pvw'* *'nopvw'* *E590*
'previewwindow' 'pvw'	boolean (default off)
			local to window
			{not in Vi}
			{not available when compiled without the |+windows| or
			|+quickfix| features}
	Identifies the preview window.  Only one window can have this option
	set.  It's normally not set directly, but by using one of the commands
	|:ptag|, |:pedit|, etc.

						*'printdevice'* *'pdev'*
'printdevice' 'pdev'	string	(default empty)
			global
			{not in Vi}
			{only available when compiled with the |+printer|
			feature}
	The name of the printer to be used for |:hardcopy|.
	See |pdev-option|.
	This option cannot be set from a |modeline| or in the |sandbox|, for
	security reasons.

			{only available when compiled with |+printer| feature}
	List of items that control the format of the output of |:hardcopy|.
	See |popt-option|.

						*'prompt'* *'noprompt'*

						*'pumheight'* *'ph'*
'pumheight' 'ph'	number	(default 0)
			global
			{not available when compiled without the
			|+insert_expand| feature}
			{not in Vi}
	Determines the maximum number of items to show in the popup menu for
	Insert mode completion.  When zero as much space as available is used.
	|ins-completion-menu|.


						*'quoteescape'* *'qe'*
'quoteescape' 'qe'	string	(default "\")
			local to buffer
			{not in Vi}
	The characters that are used to escape quotes in a string.  Used for
	objects like a', a" and a` |a'|.
	When one of the characters in this option is found inside a string,
	the following character will be skipped.  The default value makes the
	text "foo\"bar\\" considered to be one string.

				   *'readonly'* *'ro'* *'noreadonly'* *'noro'*
'readonly' 'ro'		boolean	(default off)
			local to buffer
	If on, writes fail unless you use a '!'.  Protects you from
	accidentally overwriting a file.  Default on when Vim is started
	in read-only mode ("vim -R") or when the executable is called "view".
	When using ":w!" the 'readonly' option is reset for the current
	buffer, unless the 'Z' flag is in 'cpoptions'.
	{not in Vi:}  When using the ":view" command the 'readonly' option is
	set for the newly edited buffer.

						*'redrawtime'* *'rdt'*
'redrawtime' 'rdt'	number	(default 2000)
			global
			{not in Vi}
			{only available when compiled with the |+reltime|
			feature}
	The time in milliseconds for redrawing the display.  This applies to
	searching for patterns for 'hlsearch' and |:match| highlighting.
	When redrawing takes more than this many milliseconds no further
	matches will be highlighted.  This is used to avoid that Vim hangs
	when using a very complicated pattern.

						*'regexpengine'* *'re'*
'regexpengine' 're'	number	(default 0)
			global
			{not in Vi}
	This selects the default regexp engine. |two-engines|
	The possible values are:
		0	automatic selection
		1	old engine
		2	NFA engine
	Note that when using the NFA engine and the pattern contains something
	that is not supported the pattern will not match.  This is only useful
	for debugging the regexp engine.

		*'relativenumber'* *'rnu'* *'norelativenumber'* *'nornu'*
'relativenumber' 'rnu'	boolean	(default off)
			local to window
			{not in Vi}
	Show the line number relative to the line with the cursor in front of
	each line. Relative line numbers help you use the |count| you can
	precede some vertical motion commands (e.g. j k + -) with, without
	having to calculate it yourself. Especially useful in combination with
	other commands (e.g. y d c < > gq gw =).
	When the 'n' option is excluded from 'cpoptions' a wrapped
	line will not use the column of line numbers (this is the default when
	'compatible' isn't set).
	The 'numberwidth' option can be used to set the room used for the line
	number.
	When a long, wrapped line doesn't start with the first character, '-'
	characters are put before the number.
	See |hl-LineNr|  and |hl-CursorLineNr| for the highlighting used for
	the number.
	
	The number in front of the cursor line also depends on the value of
	'number', see |number_relativenumber| for all combinations of the two
	options.

						*'remap'* *'noremap'*
'remap'			boolean	(default on)
			global
	Allows for mappings to work recursively.  If you do not want this for
	a single entry, use the :noremap[!] command.
	NOTE: To avoid portability problems with Vim scripts, always keep
	this option at the default "on".  Only switch it off when working with
	old Vi scripts.

                                               *'renderoptions'* *'rop'*

	Other render types are currently not supported.

						*'report'*
'report'		number	(default 2)
			global
	Threshold for reporting number of lines changed.  When the number of
	changed lines is more than 'report' a message will be given for most
	":" commands.  If you want it always, set 'report' to 0.
	For the ":substitute" command the number of substitutions is used
	instead of the number of lines.

			 *'restorescreen'* *'rs'* *'norestorescreen'* *'nors'*
'restorescreen' 'rs'	boolean	(default on)
			global
			{not in Vi}  {only in Windows 95/NT console version}
	When set, the screen contents is restored when exiting Vim.  This also
	happens when executing external commands.

	For non-Windows Vim: You can set or reset the 't_ti' and 't_te'
	options in your .vimrc.  To disable restoring:
		set t_ti= t_te=
	To enable restoring (for an xterm):
		set t_ti=^[7^[[r^[[?47h t_te=^[[?47l^[8
	(Where ^[ is an <Esc>, type CTRL-V <Esc> to insert it)

				*'revins'* *'ri'* *'norevins'* *'nori'*
'revins' 'ri'		boolean	(default off)
			global
			{not in Vi}
			{only available when compiled with the |+rightleft|
			feature}
	Inserting characters in Insert mode will work backwards.  See "typing
	backwards" |ins-reverse|.  This option can be toggled with the CTRL-_
	command in Insert mode, when 'allowrevins' is set.
	NOTE: This option is reset when 'compatible' or 'paste' is set.

				 *'rightleft'* *'rl'* *'norightleft'* *'norl'*
'rightleft' 'rl'	boolean	(default off)
			local to window
			{not in Vi}
			{only available when compiled with the |+rightleft|
			feature}
	When on, display orientation becomes right-to-left, i.e., characters
	that are stored in the file appear from the right to the left.
	Using this option, it is possible to edit files for languages that
	are written from the right to the left such as Hebrew and Arabic.
	This option is per window, so it is possible to edit mixed files
	simultaneously, or to view the same file in both ways (this is
	useful whenever you have a mixed text file with both right-to-left
	and left-to-right strings so that both sets are displayed properly
	in different windows).  Also see |rileft.txt|.

			*'rightleftcmd'* *'rlc'*
'rightleftcmd' 'rlc'	string	(default "search")
			local to window
			{not in Vi}
			{only available when compiled with the |+rightleft|
			feature}
	Each word in this option enables the command line editing to work in
	right-to-left mode for a group of commands:

		search		"/" and "?" commands

	This is useful for languages such as Hebrew, Arabic and Farsi.
	The 'rightleft' option must be set for 'rightleftcmd' to take effect.

					 *'ruler'* *'ru'* *'noruler'* *'noru'*
'ruler' 'ru'		boolean	(default off)
			global
			{not in Vi}
			{not available when compiled without the
			|+cmdline_info| feature}
	Show the line and column number of the cursor position, separated by a
	comma.  When there is room, the relative position of the displayed
	text in the file is shown on the far right:
		Top	first line is visible
		Bot	last line is visible
		All	first and last line are visible
		45%	relative position in the file
	If 'rulerformat' is set, it will determine the contents of the ruler.
	Each window has its own ruler.  If a window has a status line, the
	ruler is shown there.  Otherwise it is shown in the last line of the
	screen.  If the statusline is given by 'statusline' (i.e. not empty),
	this option takes precedence over 'ruler' and 'rulerformat'
	If the number of characters displayed is different from the number of
	bytes in the text (e.g., for a TAB or a multi-byte character), both
	the text column (byte number) and the screen column are shown,
	separated with a dash.
	For an empty line "0-1" is shown.
	For an empty buffer the line number will also be zero: "0,0-1".
	This option is reset when the 'paste' option is set.
	If you don't want to see the ruler all the time but want to know where
	you are, use "g CTRL-G" |g_CTRL-G|.
	NOTE: This option is reset when 'compatible' is set.

						*'rulerformat'* *'ruf'*
'rulerformat' 'ruf'	string	(default empty)
			global
			{not in Vi}
			{not available when compiled without the |+statusline|
			feature}
	When this option is not empty, it determines the content of the ruler
	string, as displayed for the 'ruler' option.
	The format of this option is like that of 'statusline'.
	The default ruler width is 17 characters.  To make the ruler 15

			global
			{not in Vi}
	This is a list of directories which will be searched for runtime
	files:
	  filetype.vim	filetypes by file name |new-filetype|
	  scripts.vim	filetypes by file contents |new-filetype-scripts|
	  autoload/	automatically loaded scripts |autoload-functions|
	  colors/	color scheme files |:colorscheme|
	  compiler/	compiler files |:compiler|
	  doc/		documentation |write-local-help|
	  ftplugin/	filetype plugins |write-filetype-plugin|
	  indent/	indent scripts |indent-expression|
	  keymap/	key mapping files |mbyte-keymap|
	  lang/		menu translations |:menutrans|
	  menu.vim	GUI menus |menu.vim|
	  plugin/	plugin scripts |write-plugin|
	  print/	files for printing |postscript-print-encoding|
	  spell/	spell checking files |spell|
	  syntax/	syntax files |mysyntaxfile|
	  tutor/	files for vimtutor |tutor|

	And any other file searched for with the |:runtime| command.

	The defaults for most systems are setup to search five locations:
	1. In your home directory, for your personal preferences.
	2. In a system-wide Vim directory, for preferences from the system
	   administrator.
	3. In $VIMRUNTIME, for files distributed with Vim.
							*after-directory*
	4. In the "after" directory in the system-wide Vim directory.  This is
	   for the system administrator to overrule or add to the distributed
	   defaults (rarely needed)
	5. In the "after" directory in your home directory.  This is for
	   personal preferences to overrule or add to the distributed defaults
	   or system-wide settings (rarely needed).

	Note that, unlike 'path', no wildcards like "**" are allowed.  Normal
	wildcards are allowed, but can significantly slow down searching for
	runtime files.  For speed, use as few items as possible and avoid
	wildcards.
	See |:runtime|.
	Example: >
		:set runtimepath=~/vimruntime,/mygroup/vim,$VIMRUNTIME
<	This will use the directory "~/vimruntime" first (containing your
	personal Vim runtime files), then "/mygroup/vim" (shared between a
	group of people) and finally "$VIMRUNTIME" (the distributed runtime
	files).
	You probably should always include $VIMRUNTIME somewhere, to use the
	distributed runtime files.  You can put a directory before $VIMRUNTIME
	to find files which replace a distributed runtime files.  You can put
	a directory after $VIMRUNTIME to find files which add to distributed
	runtime files.
	This option cannot be set from a |modeline| or in the |sandbox|, for
	security reasons.

						*'scroll'* *'scr'*
'scroll' 'scr'		number	(default: half the window height)
			local to window
	Number of lines to scroll with CTRL-U and CTRL-D commands.  Will be
	set to half the number of lines in the window when the window size
	changes.  If you give a count to the CTRL-U or CTRL-D command it will
	be used as the new value for 'scroll'.  Reset to half the window
	height with ":set scroll=0".   {Vi is a bit different: 'scroll' gives
	the number of screen lines instead of file lines, makes a difference
	when lines wrap}

			*'scrollbind'* *'scb'* *'noscrollbind'* *'noscb'*
'scrollbind' 'scb'	boolean  (default off)
			local to window
			{not in Vi}
			{not available when compiled without the |+scrollbind|
			feature}
	See also |scroll-binding|.  When this option is set, the current
	window scrolls as other scrollbind windows (windows that also have
	this option set) scroll.  This option is useful for viewing the
	differences between two versions of a file, see 'diff'.
	See |'scrollopt'| for options that determine how this option should be
	interpreted.
	This option is mostly reset when splitting a window to edit another
	file.  This means that ":split | edit file" results in two windows
	with scroll-binding, but ":split file" does not.

						*'scrolljump'* *'sj'*
'scrolljump' 'sj'	number	(default 1)
			global
			{not in Vi}
	Minimal number of lines to scroll when the cursor gets off the
	screen (e.g., with "j").  Not used for scroll commands (e.g., CTRL-E,
	CTRL-D).  Useful if your terminal scrolls very slowly.
	When set to a negative number from -1 to -100 this is used as the
	percentage of the window height.  Thus -50 scrolls half the window
	height.
	NOTE: This option is set to 1 when 'compatible' is set.

						*'scrolloff'* *'so'*
'scrolloff' 'so'	number	(default 0)
			global
			{not in Vi}
	Minimal number of screen lines to keep above and below the cursor.
	This will make some context visible around where you are working.  If
	you set it to a very large value (999) the cursor line will always be
	in the middle of the window (except at the start or end of the file or
	when long lines wrap).
	For scrolling horizontally see 'sidescrolloff'.
	NOTE: This option is set to 0 when 'compatible' is set.

						*'scrollopt'* *'sbo'*
'scrollopt' 'sbo'	string	(default "ver,jump")
			global
			{not available when compiled without the |+scrollbind|
			feature}
			{not in Vi}
	This is a comma-separated list of words that specifies how
	'scrollbind' windows should behave.  'sbo' stands for ScrollBind
	Options.
	The following words are available:
	    ver		Bind vertical scrolling for 'scrollbind' windows
	    hor		Bind horizontal scrolling for 'scrollbind' windows
	    jump	Applies to the offset between two windows for vertical
			scrolling.  This offset is the difference in the first
			displayed line of the bound windows.  When moving
			around in a window, another 'scrollbind' window may
			reach a position before the start or after the end of
			the buffer.  The offset is not changed though, when
			moving back the 'scrollbind' window will try to scroll
			to the desired position when possible.
			When now making that window the current one, two
			things can be done with the relative offset:
			1. When "jump" is not included, the relative offset is
			   adjusted for the scroll position in the new current
			   window.  When going back to the other window, the
			   new relative offset will be used.
			2. When "jump" is included, the other windows are
			   scrolled to keep the same relative offset.  When
			   going back to the other window, it still uses the
			   same relative offset.
	Also see |scroll-binding|.
	When 'diff' mode is active there always is vertical scroll binding,
	even when "ver" isn't there.

						*'sections'* *'sect'*
'sections' 'sect'	string	(default "SHNHH HUnhsh")
			global
	Specifies the nroff macros that separate sections.  These are pairs of
	two letters (See |object-motions|).  The default makes a section start
	at the nroff macros ".SH", ".NH", ".H", ".HU", ".nh" and ".sh".

						*'secure'* *'nosecure'* *E523*
'secure'		boolean	(default off)
			global
			{not in Vi}
	When on, ":autocmd", shell and write commands are not allowed in
	".vimrc" and ".exrc" in the current directory and map commands are
	displayed.  Switch it off only if you know that you will not run into
	problems, or when the 'exrc' option is off.  On Unix this option is
	only used if the ".vimrc" or ".exrc" is not owned by you.  This can be
	dangerous if the systems allows users to do a "chown".  You better set
	'secure' at the end of your ~/.vimrc then.
	This option cannot be set from a |modeline| or in the |sandbox|, for
	security reasons.

						*'selection'* *'sel'*
'selection' 'sel'	string	(default "inclusive")
			global
			{not in Vi}
	This option defines the behavior of the selection.  It is only used
	in Visual and Select mode.
	Possible values:
	   value	past line     inclusive ~
	   old		   no		yes
	   inclusive	   yes		yes
	   exclusive	   yes		no
	"past line" means that the cursor is allowed to be positioned one
	character past the line.
	"inclusive" means that the last character of the selection is included
	in an operation.  For example, when "x" is used to delete the
	selection.
	Note that when "exclusive" is used and selecting from the end
	backwards, you cannot include the last character of a line, when
	starting in Normal mode and 'virtualedit' empty.

	The 'selection' option is set by the |:behave| command.

						*'selectmode'* *'slm'*
'selectmode' 'slm'	string	(default "")
			global
			{not in Vi}
	This is a comma separated list of words, which specifies when to start
	Select mode instead of Visual mode, when a selection is started.
	Possible values:
	   mouse	when using the mouse
	   key		when using shifted special keys
	   cmd		when using "v", "V" or CTRL-V
	See |Select-mode|.
	The 'selectmode' option is set by the |:behave| command.

						*'sessionoptions'* *'ssop'*
'sessionoptions' 'ssop'	string	(default: "blank,buffers,curdir,folds,
					       help,options,tabpages,winsize")
			global
			{not in Vi}
			{not available when compiled without the |+mksession|
			feature}
	Changes the effect of the |:mksession| command.  It is a comma
	separated list of words.  Each word enables saving and restoring
	something:
	   word		save and restore ~
	   blank	empty windows
	   buffers	hidden and unloaded buffers, not just those in windows
	   curdir	the current directory
	   folds	manually created folds, opened/closed folds and local
			fold options
	   globals	global variables that start with an uppercase letter
			and contain at least one lowercase letter.  Only
			String and Number types are stored.
	   help		the help window
	   localoptions	options and mappings local to a window or buffer (not
			global values for local options)
	   options	all options and mappings (also global values for local
			options)
	   resize	size of the Vim window: 'lines' and 'columns'
	   sesdir	the directory in which the session file is located
			will become the current directory (useful with
			projects accessed over a network from different
			systems)
	   slash	backslashes in file names replaced with forward
			slashes
	   tabpages	all tab pages; without this only the current tab page
			is restored, so that you can make a session for each
			tab page separately
	   unix		with Unix end-of-line format (single <NL>), even when
			on Windows or DOS
	   winpos	position of the whole Vim window
	   winsize	window sizes

	Don't include both "curdir" and "sesdir".
	When neither "curdir" nor "sesdir" is included, file names are stored
	with absolute paths.
	"slash" and "unix" are useful on Windows when sharing session files
	with Unix.  The Unix version of Vim cannot source dos format scripts,
	but the Windows version of Vim can source unix format scripts.

						*'shell'* *'sh'* *E91*
'shell' 'sh'		string	(default $SHELL or "sh",
					MS-DOS and Win32: "command.com" or
					"cmd.exe", OS/2: "cmd")
			global
	Name of the shell to use for ! and :! commands.  When changing the
	value also check these options: 'shelltype', 'shellpipe', 'shellslash'
	'shellredir', 'shellquote', 'shellxquote' and 'shellcmdflag'.
	It is allowed to give an argument to the command, e.g.  "csh -f".
	See |option-backslash| about including spaces and backslashes.
	Environment variables are expanded |:set_env|.
	If the name of the shell contains a space, you might need to enclose
	it in quotes.  Example: >
		:set shell=\"c:\program\ files\unix\sh.exe\"\ -f
<	Note the backslash before each quote (to avoid starting a comment) and
	each space (to avoid ending the option value).  Also note that the
	"-f" is not inside the quotes, because it is not part of the command
	name.  And Vim automagically recognizes the backslashes that are path
	separators.
	For Dos 32 bits (DJGPP), you can set the $DJSYSFLAGS environment
	variable to change the way external commands are executed.  See the
	libc.inf file of DJGPP.
	Under MS-Windows, when the executable ends in ".com" it must be
	included.  Thus setting the shell to "command.com" or "4dos.com"
	works, but "command" and "4dos" do not work for all commands (e.g.,
	filtering).
	For unknown reasons, when using "4dos.com" the current directory is
	changed to "C:\".  To avoid this set 'shell' like this: >
		:set shell=command.com\ /c\ 4dos
<	This option cannot be set from a |modeline| or in the |sandbox|, for
	security reasons.

						*'shellcmdflag'* *'shcf'*
'shellcmdflag' 'shcf'	string	(default: "-c";
				 MS-DOS and Win32, when 'shell' does not
				 contain "sh" somewhere: "/c")
			global
			{not in Vi}
	Flag passed to the shell to execute "!" and ":!" commands; e.g.,
	"bash.exe -c ls" or "command.com /c dir".  For the MS-DOS-like
	systems, the default is set according to the value of 'shell', to
	reduce the need to set this option by the user.  It's not used for
	OS/2 (EMX figures this out itself).
	On Unix it can have more than one flag.  Each white space separated
	part is passed as an argument to the shell command.
	See |option-backslash| about including spaces and backslashes.
	Also see |dos-shell| for MS-DOS and MS-Windows.
	This option cannot be set from a |modeline| or in the |sandbox|, for
	security reasons.

						*'shellpipe'* *'sp'*
'shellpipe' 'sp'	string	(default ">", "| tee", "|& tee" or "2>&1| tee")
			global
			{not in Vi}
			{not available when compiled without the |+quickfix|
			feature}
	String to be used to put the output of the ":make" command in the
	error file.  See also |:make_makeprg|.  See |option-backslash| about
	including spaces and backslashes.
	The name of the temporary file can be represented by "%s" if necessary
	(the file name is appended automatically if no %s appears in the value
	of this option).
	For the Amiga and MS-DOS the default is ">".  The output is directly
	saved in a file and not echoed to the screen.
	For Unix the default it "| tee".  The stdout of the compiler is saved
	in a file and echoed to the screen.  If the 'shell' option is "csh" or
	"tcsh" after initializations, the default becomes "|& tee".  If the
	'shell' option is "sh", "ksh", "mksh", "pdksh", "zsh" or "bash" the
	default becomes "2>&1| tee".  This means that stderr is also included.
	Before using the 'shell' option a path is removed, thus "/bin/sh" uses
	"sh".
	The initialization of this option is done after reading the ".vimrc"
	and the other initializations, so that when the 'shell' option is set
	there, the 'shellpipe' option changes automatically, unless it was
	explicitly set before.
	When 'shellpipe' is set to an empty string, no redirection of the
	":make" output will be done.  This is useful if you use a 'makeprg'
	that writes to 'makeef' by itself.  If you want no piping, but do
	want to include the 'makeef', set 'shellpipe' to a single space.
	Don't forget to precede the space with a backslash: ":set sp=\ ".
	In the future pipes may be used for filtering and this option will
	become obsolete (at least for Unix).
	This option cannot be set from a |modeline| or in the |sandbox|, for
	security reasons.

						*'shellquote'* *'shq'*
'shellquote' 'shq'	string	(default: ""; MS-DOS and Win32, when 'shell'
					contains "sh" somewhere: "\"")
			global
			{not in Vi}
	Quoting character(s), put around the command passed to the shell, for
	the "!" and ":!" commands.  The redirection is kept outside of the
	quoting.  See 'shellxquote' to include the redirection.  It's
	probably not useful to set both options.
	This is an empty string by default.  Only known to be useful for
	third-party shells on MS-DOS-like systems, such as the MKS Korn Shell
	or bash, where it should be "\"".  The default is adjusted according
	the value of 'shell', to reduce the need to set this option by the
	user.  See |dos-shell|.
	This option cannot be set from a |modeline| or in the |sandbox|, for
	security reasons.

						*'shellredir'* *'srr'*
'shellredir' 'srr'	string	(default ">", ">&" or ">%s 2>&1")
			global
			{not in Vi}
	String to be used to put the output of a filter command in a temporary
	file.  See also |:!|.  See |option-backslash| about including spaces
	and backslashes.
	The name of the temporary file can be represented by "%s" if necessary
	(the file name is appended automatically if no %s appears in the value
	of this option).
	The default is ">".  For Unix, if the 'shell' option is "csh", "tcsh"
	or "zsh" during initializations, the default becomes ">&".  If the
	'shell' option is "sh", "ksh" or "bash" the default becomes
	">%s 2>&1".  This means that stderr is also included.
	For Win32, the Unix checks are done and additionally "cmd" is checked
	for, which makes the default ">%s 2>&1".  Also, the same names with
	".exe" appended are checked for.
	The initialization of this option is done after reading the ".vimrc"
	and the other initializations, so that when the 'shell' option is set
	there, the 'shellredir' option changes automatically unless it was
	explicitly set before.
	In the future pipes may be used for filtering and this option will
	become obsolete (at least for Unix).
	This option cannot be set from a |modeline| or in the |sandbox|, for
	security reasons.

			*'shellslash'* *'ssl'* *'noshellslash'* *'nossl'*
'shellslash' 'ssl'	boolean	(default off)
			global
			{not in Vi} {only for MSDOS, MS-Windows and OS/2}
	When set, a forward slash is used when expanding file names.  This is
	useful when a Unix-like shell is used instead of command.com or
	cmd.exe.  Backward slashes can still be typed, but they are changed to
	forward slashes by Vim.
	Note that setting or resetting this option has no effect for some
	existing file names, thus this option needs to be set before opening
	any file for best results.  This might change in the future.
	'shellslash' only works when a backslash can be used as a path
	separator.  To test if this is so use: >
		if exists('+shellslash')
<
			*'shelltemp'* *'stmp'* *'noshelltemp'* *'nostmp'*
'shelltemp' 'stmp'	boolean	(Vi default off, Vim default on)
			global
			{not in Vi}
	When on, use temp files for shell commands.  When off use a pipe.
	When using a pipe is not possible temp files are used anyway.
	Currently a pipe is only supported on Unix and MS-Windows 2K and
	later.  You can check it with: >
		:if has("filterpipe")
<	The advantage of using a pipe is that nobody can read the temp file
	and the 'shell' command does not need to support redirection.
	The advantage of using a temp file is that the file type and encoding
	can be detected.
	The |FilterReadPre|, |FilterReadPost| and |FilterWritePre|,
	|FilterWritePost| autocommands event are not triggered when
	'shelltemp' is off.

						*'shelltype'* *'st'*
'shelltype' 'st'	number	(default 0)
			global
			{not in Vi} {only for the Amiga}
	On the Amiga this option influences the way how the commands work
	which use a shell.
	0 and 1: always use the shell
	2 and 3: use the shell only to filter lines
	4 and 5: use shell only for ':sh' command
	When not using the shell, the command is executed directly.

	0 and 2: use "shell 'shellcmdflag' cmd" to start external commands
	1 and 3: use "shell cmd" to start external commands

						*'shellxescape'* *'sxe'*
'shellxescape' 'sxe'	string	(default: "";
				 for MS-DOS and MS-Windows: "\"&|<>()@^")
			global
			{not in Vi}
	When 'shellxquote' is set to "(" then the characters listed in this
	option will be escaped with a '^' character.  This makes it possible
	to execute most external commands with cmd.exe.

						*'shellxquote'* *'sxq'*
'shellxquote' 'sxq'	string	(default: "";
					for Win32, when 'shell' is cmd.exe: "("
					for Win32, when 'shell' contains "sh"
					somewhere: "\""
					for Unix, when using system(): "\"")
			global
			{not in Vi}
	Quoting character(s), put around the command passed to the shell, for
	the "!" and ":!" commands.  Includes the redirection.  See
	'shellquote' to exclude the redirection.  It's probably not useful
	to set both options.
	When the value is '(' then ')' is appended. When the value is '"('
	then ')"' is appended.
	When the value is '(' then also see 'shellxescape'.
	This is an empty string by default on most systems, but is known to be
	useful for on Win32 version, either for cmd.exe which automatically
	strips off the first and last quote on a command, or 3rd-party shells
	such as the MKS Korn Shell or bash, where it should be "\"".  The
	default is adjusted according the value of 'shell', to reduce the need
	to set this option by the user.  See |dos-shell|.
	This option cannot be set from a |modeline| or in the |sandbox|, for
	security reasons.

			*'shiftround'* *'sr'* *'noshiftround'* *'nosr'*
'shiftround' 'sr'	boolean	(default off)
			global
			{not in Vi}
	Round indent to multiple of 'shiftwidth'.  Applies to > and <
	commands.  CTRL-T and CTRL-D in Insert mode always round the indent to
	a multiple of 'shiftwidth' (this is Vi compatible).
	NOTE: This option is reset when 'compatible' is set.

						*'shiftwidth'* *'sw'*
'shiftwidth' 'sw'	number	(default 8)
			local to buffer
	Number of spaces to use for each step of (auto)indent.  Used for
	|'cindent'|, |>>|, |<<|, etc.
	When zero the 'ts' value will be used.  Use the |shiftwidth()|
	function to get the effective shiftwidth value.

						*'shortmess'* *'shm'*
'shortmess' 'shm'	string	(Vim default "filnxtToO", Vi default: "",
							POSIX default: "A")
			global
			{not in Vi}
	This option helps to avoid all the |hit-enter| prompts caused by file
	messages, for example  with CTRL-G, and to avoid some other messages.
	It is a list of flags:
	 flag	meaning when present	~
	  f	use "(3 of 5)" instead of "(file 3 of 5)"
	  i	use "[noeol]" instead of "[Incomplete last line]"
	  l	use "999L, 888C" instead of "999 lines, 888 characters"
	  m	use "[+]" instead of "[Modified]"
	  n	use "[New]" instead of "[New File]"
	  r	use "[RO]" instead of "[readonly]"
	  w	use "[w]" instead of "written" for file write message
		and "[a]" instead of "appended" for ':w >> file' command
	  x	use "[dos]" instead of "[dos format]", "[unix]" instead of
		"[unix format]" and "[mac]" instead of "[mac format]".
	  a	all of the above abbreviations

	  o	overwrite message for writing a file with subsequent message
		for reading a file (useful for ":wn" or when 'autowrite' on)
	  O	message for reading a file overwrites any previous message.
		Also for quickfix message (e.g., ":cn").
	  s	don't give "search hit BOTTOM, continuing at TOP" or "search
		hit TOP, continuing at BOTTOM" messages
	  t	truncate file message at the start if it is too long to fit
		on the command-line, "<" will appear in the left most column.
		Ignored in Ex mode.
	  T	truncate other messages in the middle if they are too long to
		fit on the command line.  "..." will appear in the middle.
		Ignored in Ex mode.
	  W	don't give "written" or "[w]" when writing a file
	  A	don't give the "ATTENTION" message when an existing swap file
		is found.
	  I	don't give the intro message when starting Vim |:intro|.
	  c	don't give |ins-completion-menu| messages.  For example,
		"-- XXX completion (YYY)", "match 1 of 2", "The only match",
		"Pattern not found", "Back at original", etc.

	This gives you the opportunity to avoid that a change between buffers
	requires you to hit <Enter>, but still gives as useful a message as
	possible for the space available.  To get the whole message that you
	would have got with 'shm' empty, use ":file!"
	Useful values:
	    shm=	No abbreviation of message.
	    shm=a	Abbreviation, but no loss of information.
	    shm=at	Abbreviation, and truncate message when necessary.

	NOTE: This option is set to the Vi default value when 'compatible' is
	set and to the Vim default value when 'compatible' is reset.

				 *'shortname'* *'sn'* *'noshortname'* *'nosn'*
'shortname' 'sn'	boolean	(default off)
			local to buffer
			{not in Vi, not in MS-DOS versions}
	Filenames are assumed to be 8 characters plus one extension of 3
	characters.  Multiple dots in file names are not allowed.  When this
	option is on, dots in file names are replaced with underscores when
	adding an extension (".~" or ".swp").  This option is not available
	for MS-DOS, because then it would always be on.  This option is useful
	when editing files on an MS-DOS compatible filesystem, e.g., messydos
	or crossdos.  When running the Win32 GUI version under Win32s, this
	option is always on by default.

						*'showbreak'* *'sbr'* *E595*
'showbreak' 'sbr'	string	(default "")
			global
			{not in Vi}
			{not available when compiled without the |+linebreak|
			feature}
	String to put at the start of lines that have been wrapped.  Useful
	values are "> " or "+++ ": >
		:set showbreak=>\ 
<	Note the backslash to escape the trailing space.  It's easier like
	this: >
		:let &showbreak = '+++ '
<	Only printable single-cell characters are allowed, excluding <Tab> and
	comma (in a future version the comma might be used to separate the
	part that is shown at the end and at the start of a line).
	The characters are highlighted according to the '@' flag in
	'highlight'.
	Note that tabs after the showbreak will be displayed differently.
	If you want the 'showbreak' to appear in between line numbers, add the
	"n" flag to 'cpoptions'.

				     *'showcmd'* *'sc'* *'noshowcmd'* *'nosc'*
'showcmd' 'sc'		boolean	(Vim default: on, off for Unix, Vi default:
				 off)
			global
			{not in Vi}
			{not available when compiled without the
			|+cmdline_info| feature}
	Show (partial) command in the last line of the screen.  Set this
	option off if your terminal is slow.
	In Visual mode the size of the selected area is shown:
	- When selecting characters within a line, the number of characters.
	  If the number of bytes is different it is also displayed: "2-6"
	  means two characters and six bytes.
	- When selecting more than one line, the number of lines.
	- When selecting a block, the size in screen characters:
	  {lines}x{columns}.
	NOTE: This option is set to the Vi default value when 'compatible' is
	set and to the Vim default value when 'compatible' is reset.

			*'showfulltag'* *'sft'* *'noshowfulltag'* *'nosft'*
'showfulltag' 'sft'	boolean (default off)
			global
			{not in Vi}
	When completing a word in insert mode (see |ins-completion|) from the
	tags file, show both the tag name and a tidied-up form of the search
	pattern (if there is one) as possible matches.  Thus, if you have
	matched a C function, you can see a template for what arguments are
	required (coding style permitting).
	Note that this doesn't work well together with having "longest" in
	'completeopt', because the completion from the search pattern may not
	match the typed text.

				 *'showmatch'* *'sm'* *'noshowmatch'* *'nosm'*
'showmatch' 'sm'	boolean	(default off)
			global
	When a bracket is inserted, briefly jump to the matching one.  The
	jump is only done if the match can be seen on the screen.  The time to
	show the match can be set with 'matchtime'.
	A Beep is given if there is no match (no matter if the match can be
	seen or not).  This option is reset when the 'paste' option is set.
	When the 'm' flag is not included in 'cpoptions', typing a character
	will immediately move the cursor back to where it belongs.
	See the "sm" field in 'guicursor' for setting the cursor shape and
	blinking when showing the match.
	The 'matchpairs' option can be used to specify the characters to show
	matches for.  'rightleft' and 'revins' are used to look for opposite
	matches.
	Also see the matchparen plugin for highlighting the match when moving
	around |pi_paren.txt|.
	Note: Use of the short form is rated PG.

				 *'showmode'* *'smd'* *'noshowmode'* *'nosmd'*
'showmode' 'smd'	boolean	(Vim default: on, Vi default: off)
			global
	If in Insert, Replace or Visual mode put a message on the last line.
	Use the 'M' flag in 'highlight' to set the type of highlighting for
	this message.
	When |XIM| may be used the message will include "XIM".  But this
	doesn't mean XIM is really active, especially when 'imactivatekey' is
	not set.
	NOTE: This option is set to the Vi default value when 'compatible' is
	set and to the Vim default value when 'compatible' is reset.

						*'showtabline'* *'stal'*
'showtabline' 'stal'	number	(default 1)
			global
			{not in Vi}
			{not available when compiled without the |+windows|
			feature}
	The value of this option specifies when the line with tab page labels
	will be displayed:
		0: never
		1: only if there are at least two tab pages
		2: always
	This is both for the GUI and non-GUI implementation of the tab pages
	line.
	See |tab-page| for more information about tab pages.

						*'sidescroll'* *'ss'*
'sidescroll' 'ss'	number	(default 0)
			global
			{not in Vi}
	The minimal number of columns to scroll horizontally.  Used only when
	the 'wrap' option is off and the cursor is moved off of the screen.
	When it is zero the cursor will be put in the middle of the screen.
	When using a slow terminal set it to a large number or 0.  When using
	a fast terminal use a small number or 1.  Not used for "zh" and "zl"
	commands.

						*'sidescrolloff'* *'siso'*
'sidescrolloff' 'siso'	number (default 0)
			global
			{not in Vi}
	The minimal number of screen columns to keep to the left and to the
	right of the cursor if 'nowrap' is set.  Setting this option to a
	value greater than 0 while having |'sidescroll'| also at a non-zero
	value makes some context visible in the line you are scrolling in
	horizontally (except at beginning of the line).  Setting this option
	to a large value (like 999) has the effect of keeping the cursor
	horizontally centered in the window, as long as one does not come too
	close to the beginning of the line.
	NOTE: This option is set to 0 when 'compatible' is set.

	Example: Try this together with 'sidescroll' and 'listchars' as
		 in the following example to never allow the cursor to move
		 onto the "extends" character:

		 :set nowrap sidescroll=1 listchars=extends:>,precedes:<
		 :set sidescrolloff=1


			*'smartcase'* *'scs'* *'nosmartcase'* *'noscs'*
'smartcase' 'scs'	boolean	(default off)
			global
			{not in Vi}
	Override the 'ignorecase' option if the search pattern contains upper
	case characters.  Only used when the search pattern is typed and
	'ignorecase' option is on.  Used for the commands "/", "?", "n", "N",
	":g" and ":s".  Not used for "*", "#", "gd", tag search, etc.  After
	"*" and "#" you can make 'smartcase' used by doing a "/" command,
	recalling the search pattern from history and hitting <Enter>.
	NOTE: This option is reset when 'compatible' is set.

			     *'smartindent'* *'si'* *'nosmartindent'* *'nosi'*
'smartindent' 'si'	boolean	(default off)
			local to buffer
			{not in Vi}
			{not available when compiled without the
			|+smartindent| feature}
	Do smart autoindenting when starting a new line.  Works for C-like
	programs, but can also be used for other languages.  'cindent' does
	something like this, works better in most cases, but is more strict,
	see |C-indenting|.  When 'cindent' is on or 'indentexpr' is set,
	setting 'si' has no effect.  'indentexpr' is a more advanced
	alternative.
	Normally 'autoindent' should also be on when using 'smartindent'.
	An indent is automatically inserted:
	- After a line ending in '{'.
	- After a line starting with a keyword from 'cinwords'.
	- Before a line starting with '}' (only with the "O" command).
	When typing '}' as the first character in a new line, that line is
	given the same indent as the matching '{'.
	When typing '#' as the first character in a new line, the indent for
	that line is removed, the '#' is put in the first column.  The indent
	is restored for the next line.  If you don't want this, use this
	mapping: ":inoremap # X^H#", where ^H is entered with CTRL-V CTRL-H.
	When using the ">>" command, lines starting with '#' are not shifted
	right.
	NOTE: 'smartindent' is reset when 'compatible' is set.  When 'paste'
	is set smart indenting is disabled.

				 *'smarttab'* *'sta'* *'nosmarttab'* *'nosta'*
'smarttab' 'sta'	boolean	(default off)
			global
			{not in Vi}
	When on, a <Tab> in front of a line inserts blanks according to
	'shiftwidth'.  'tabstop' or 'softtabstop' is used in other places.  A
	<BS> will delete a 'shiftwidth' worth of space at the start of the
	line.
	When off, a <Tab> always inserts blanks according to 'tabstop' or
	'softtabstop'.  'shiftwidth' is only used for shifting text left or
	right |shift-left-right|.
	What gets inserted (a <Tab> or spaces) depends on the 'expandtab'
	option.  Also see |ins-expandtab|.  When 'expandtab' is not set, the
	number of spaces is minimized by using <Tab>s.
	NOTE: This option is reset when 'compatible' is set.

					*'softtabstop'* *'sts'*
'softtabstop' 'sts'	number	(default 0)
			local to buffer
			{not in Vi}
	Number of spaces that a <Tab> counts for while performing editing
	operations, like inserting a <Tab> or using <BS>.  It "feels" like
	<Tab>s are being inserted, while in fact a mix of spaces and <Tab>s is
	used.  This is useful to keep the 'ts' setting at its standard value
	of 8, while being able to edit like it is set to 'sts'.  However,
	commands like "x" still work on the actual characters.
	When 'sts' is zero, this feature is off.
	When 'sts' is negative, the value of 'shiftwidth' is used.
	'softtabstop' is set to 0 when the 'paste' option is set.
	See also |ins-expandtab|.  When 'expandtab' is not set, the number of
	spaces is minimized by using <Tab>s.
	The 'L' flag in 'cpoptions' changes how tabs are used when 'list' is
	set.
	NOTE: This option is set to 0 when 'compatible' is set.

						*'spell'* *'nospell'*
'spell'			boolean	(default off)
			local to window
			{not in Vi}
			{not available when compiled without the |+syntax|
			feature}
	When on spell checking will be done.  See |spell|.
	The languages are specified with 'spelllang'.

						*'spellcapcheck'* *'spc'*
'spellcapcheck' 'spc'	string	(default "[.?!]\_[\])'" \t]\+")
			local to buffer
			{not in Vi}
			{not available when compiled without the |+syntax|
			feature}
	Pattern to locate the end of a sentence.  The following word will be
	checked to start with a capital letter.  If not then it is highlighted
	with SpellCap |hl-SpellCap| (unless the word is also badly spelled).
	When this check is not wanted make this option empty.
	Only used when 'spell' is set.
	Be careful with special characters, see |option-backslash| about
	including spaces and backslashes.
	To set this option automatically depending on the language, see
	|set-spc-auto|.

						*'spellfile'* *'spf'*
'spellfile' 'spf'	string	(default empty)
			local to buffer
			{not in Vi}
			{not available when compiled without the |+syntax|
			feature}
	Name of the word list file where words are added for the |zg| and |zw|
	commands.  It must end in ".{encoding}.add".  You need to include the
	path, otherwise the file is placed in the current directory.
								*E765*
	It may also be a comma separated list of names.  A count before the
	|zg| and |zw| commands can be used to access each.  This allows using
	a personal word list file and a project word list file.
	When a word is added while this option is empty Vim will set it for
	you: Using the first directory in 'runtimepath' that is writable.  If
	there is no "spell" directory yet it will be created.  For the file
	name the first language name that appears in 'spelllang' is used,
	ignoring the region.
	The resulting ".spl" file will be used for spell checking, it does not
	have to appear in 'spelllang'.
	Normally one file is used for all regions, but you can add the region
	name if you want to.  However, it will then only be used when
	'spellfile' is set to it, for entries in 'spelllang' only files
	without region name will be found.
	This option cannot be set from a |modeline| or in the |sandbox|, for
	security reasons.

						*'spelllang'* *'spl'*
'spelllang' 'spl'	string	(default "en")
			local to buffer
			{not in Vi}
			{not available when compiled without the |+syntax|
			feature}
	A comma separated list of word list names.  When the 'spell' option is
	on spellchecking will be done for these languages.  Example: >
		set spelllang=en_us,nl,medical
<	This means US English, Dutch and medical words are recognized.  Words
	that are not recognized will be highlighted.
	The word list name must not include a comma or dot.  Using a dash is
	recommended to separate the two letter language name from a
	specification.  Thus "en-rare" is used for rare English words.
	A region name must come last and have the form "_xx", where "xx" is
	the two-letter, lower case region name.  You can use more than one
	region by listing them: "en_us,en_ca" supports both US and Canadian
	English, but not words specific for Australia, New Zealand or Great
	Britain.
	If the name "cjk" is included East Asian characters are excluded from
	spell checking.  This is useful when editing text that also has Asian
	words.
							*E757*
	As a special case the name of a .spl file can be given as-is.  The
	first "_xx" in the name is removed and used as the region name
	(_xx is an underscore, two letters and followed by a non-letter).
	This is mainly for testing purposes.  You must make sure the correct
	encoding is used, Vim doesn't check it.
	When 'encoding' is set the word lists are reloaded.  Thus it's a good
	idea to set 'spelllang' after setting 'encoding' to avoid loading the
	files twice.
	How the related spell files are found is explained here: |spell-load|.

	If the |spellfile.vim| plugin is active and you use a language name
	for which Vim cannot find the .spl file in 'runtimepath' the plugin
	will ask you if you want to download the file.

	After this option has been set successfully, Vim will source the files
	"spell/LANG.vim" in 'runtimepath'.  "LANG" is the value of 'spelllang'
	up to the first comma, dot or underscore.
	Also see |set-spc-auto|.


						*'spellsuggest'* *'sps'*
'spellsuggest' 'sps'	string	(default "best")
			global
			{not in Vi}
			{not available when compiled without the |+syntax|
			feature}
	Methods used for spelling suggestions.  Both for the |z=| command and
	the |spellsuggest()| function.  This is a comma-separated list of
	items:

	best		Internal method that works best for English.  Finds
			changes like "fast" and uses a bit of sound-a-like
			scoring to improve the ordering.

	double		Internal method that uses two methods and mixes the
			results.  The first method is "fast", the other method
			computes how much the suggestion sounds like the bad
			word.  That only works when the language specifies
			sound folding.  Can be slow and doesn't always give
			better results.

	fast		Internal method that only checks for simple changes:
			character inserts/deletes/swaps.  Works well for
			simple typing mistakes.

	{number}	The maximum number of suggestions listed for |z=|.
			Not used for |spellsuggest()|.  The number of
			suggestions is never more than the value of 'lines'
			minus two.

	file:{filename} Read file {filename}, which must have two columns,
			separated by a slash.  The first column contains the
			bad word, the second column the suggested good word.
			Example:
				theribal/terrible ~
			Use this for common mistakes that do not appear at the
			top of the suggestion list with the internal methods.
			Lines without a slash are ignored, use this for
			comments.
			The word in the second column must be correct,
			otherwise it will not be used.  Add the word to an
			".add" file if it is currently flagged as a spelling
			mistake.
			The file is used for all languages.

	expr:{expr}	Evaluate expression {expr}.  Use a function to avoid
			trouble with spaces.  |v:val| holds the badly spelled
			word.  The expression must evaluate to a List of
			Lists, each with a suggestion and a score.
			Example:
				[['the', 33], ['that', 44]]
			Set 'verbose' and use |z=| to see the scores that the
			internal methods use.  A lower score is better.
			This may invoke |spellsuggest()| if you temporarily
			set 'spellsuggest' to exclude the "expr:" part.
			Errors are silently ignored, unless you set the
			'verbose' option to a non-zero value.

	Only one of "best", "double" or "fast" may be used.  The others may
	appear several times in any order.  Example: >
		:set sps=file:~/.vim/sugg,best,expr:MySuggest()
<
	This option cannot be set from a |modeline| or in the |sandbox|, for
	security reasons.


			*'splitbelow'* *'sb'* *'nosplitbelow'* *'nosb'*
'splitbelow' 'sb'	boolean	(default off)
			global
			{not in Vi}
			{not available when compiled without the |+windows|
			feature}
	When on, splitting a window will put the new window below the current
	one. |:split|

			*'splitright'* *'spr'* *'nosplitright'* *'nospr'*
'splitright' 'spr'	boolean	(default off)
			global
			{not in Vi}
			{not available when compiled without the |+vertsplit|
			feature}
	When on, splitting a window will put the new window right of the
	current one. |:vsplit|

			   *'startofline'* *'sol'* *'nostartofline'* *'nosol'*
'startofline' 'sol'	boolean	(default on)
			global
			{not in Vi}
	When "on" the commands listed below move the cursor to the first
	non-blank of the line.  When off the cursor is kept in the same column
	(if possible).  This applies to the commands: CTRL-D, CTRL-U, CTRL-B,
	CTRL-F, "G", "H", "M", "L", gg, and to the commands "d", "<<" and ">>"
	with a linewise operator, with "%" with a count and to buffer changing
	commands (CTRL-^, :bnext, :bNext, etc.).  Also for an Ex command that
	only has a line number, e.g., ":25" or ":+".
	In case of buffer changing commands the cursor is placed at the column
	where it was the last time the buffer was edited.
	NOTE: This option is set when 'compatible' is set.

			   *'statusline'* *'stl'* *E540* *E542*
'statusline' 'stl'	string	(default empty)
			global or local to window |global-local|
			{not in Vi}
			{not available when compiled without the |+statusline|
			feature}
	When nonempty, this option determines the content of the status line.
	Also see |status-line|.

	The option consists of printf style '%' items interspersed with
	normal text.  Each status line item is of the form:
	  %-0{minwid}.{maxwid}{item}
	All fields except the {item} is optional.  A single percent sign can
	be given as "%%".  Up to 80 items can be specified.  *E541*

	When the option starts with "%!" then it is used as an expression,
	evaluated and the result is used as the option value.  Example: >
		:set statusline=%!MyStatusLine()
<	The result can contain %{} items that will be evaluated too.
	Note that the "%!" expression is evaluated in the context of the
	current window and buffer, while %{} items are evaluated in the
	context of the window that the statusline belongs to.

	When there is error while evaluating the option then it will be made
	empty to avoid further errors.  Otherwise screen updating would loop.

	Note that the only effect of 'ruler' when this option is set (and
	'laststatus' is 2) is controlling the output of |CTRL-G|.

	field	    meaning ~
	-	    Left justify the item.  The default is right justified
		    when minwid is larger than the length of the item.
	0	    Leading zeroes in numeric items.  Overridden by '-'.
	minwid	    Minimum width of the item, padding as set by '-' & '0'.
		    Value must be 50 or less.
	maxwid	    Maximum width of the item.  Truncation occurs with a '<'
		    on the left for text items.  Numeric items will be
		    shifted down to maxwid-2 digits followed by '>'number
		    where number is the amount of missing digits, much like
		    an exponential notation.
	item	    A one letter code as described below.

	Following is a description of the possible statusline items.  The
	second character in "item" is the type:
		N for number
		S for string
		F for flags as described below
		- not applicable

	item  meaning ~
	f S   Path to the file in the buffer, as typed or relative to current
	      directory.
	F S   Full path to the file in the buffer.
	t S   File name (tail) of file in the buffer.
	m F   Modified flag, text is "[+]"; "[-]" if 'modifiable' is off.
	M F   Modified flag, text is ",+" or ",-".
	r F   Readonly flag, text is "[RO]".
	R F   Readonly flag, text is ",RO".
	h F   Help buffer flag, text is "[help]".
	H F   Help buffer flag, text is ",HLP".
	w F   Preview window flag, text is "[Preview]".
	W F   Preview window flag, text is ",PRV".
	y F   Type of file in the buffer, e.g., "[vim]".  See 'filetype'.
	Y F   Type of file in the buffer, e.g., ",VIM".  See 'filetype'.
	      {not available when compiled without |+autocmd| feature}
	q S   "[Quickfix List]", "[Location List]" or empty.
	k S   Value of "b:keymap_name" or 'keymap' when |:lmap| mappings are
	      being used: "<keymap>"
	n N   Buffer number.
	b N   Value of character under cursor.
	B N   As above, in hexadecimal.
	o N   Byte number in file of byte under cursor, first byte is 1.
	      Mnemonic: Offset from start of file (with one added)
	      {not available when compiled without |+byte_offset| feature}
	O N   As above, in hexadecimal.
	N N   Printer page number.  (Only works in the 'printheader' option.)
	l N   Line number.
	L N   Number of lines in buffer.
	c N   Column number.
	v N   Virtual column number.
	V N   Virtual column number as -{num}.  Not displayed if equal to 'c'.
	p N   Percentage through file in lines as in |CTRL-G|.
	P S   Percentage through file of displayed window.  This is like the
	      percentage described for 'ruler'.  Always 3 in length, unless
	      translated.
	a S   Argument list status as in default title.  ({current} of {max})
	      Empty if the argument file count is zero or one.
	{ NF  Evaluate expression between '%{' and '}' and substitute result.
	      Note that there is no '%' before the closing '}'.
	( -   Start of item group.  Can be used for setting the width and
	      alignment of a section.  Must be followed by %) somewhere.
	) -   End of item group.  No width fields allowed.
	T N   For 'tabline': start of tab page N label.  Use %T after the last
	      label.  This information is used for mouse clicks.
	X N   For 'tabline': start of close tab N label.  Use %X after the
	      label, e.g.: %3Xclose%X.  Use %999X for a "close current tab"
	      mark.  This information is used for mouse clicks.
	< -   Where to truncate line if too long.  Default is at the start.
	      No width fields allowed.
	= -   Separation point between left and right aligned items.
	      No width fields allowed.
	# -   Set highlight group.  The name must follow and then a # again.
	      Thus use %#HLname# for highlight group HLname.  The same
	      highlighting is used, also for the statusline of non-current
	      windows.
	* -   Set highlight group to User{N}, where {N} is taken from the
	      minwid field, e.g. %1*.  Restore normal highlight with %* or %0*.
	      The difference between User{N} and StatusLine  will be applied
	      to StatusLineNC for the statusline of non-current windows.
	      The number N must be between 1 and 9.  See |hl-User1..9|

	When displaying a flag, Vim removes the leading comma, if any, when
	that flag comes right after plaintext.  This will make a nice display
	when flags are used like in the examples below.

	When all items in a group becomes an empty string (i.e. flags that are
	not set) and a minwid is not set for the group, the whole group will
	become empty.  This will make a group like the following disappear
	completely from the statusline when none of the flags are set. >
		:set statusline=...%(\ [%M%R%H]%)...
<
	Beware that an expression is evaluated each and every time the status
	line is displayed.  The current buffer and current window will be set
	temporarily to that of the window (and buffer) whose statusline is
	currently being drawn.  The expression will evaluate in this context.
	The variable "actual_curbuf" is set to the 'bufnr()' number of the
	real current buffer.

	The 'statusline' option will be evaluated in the |sandbox| if set from
	a modeline, see |sandbox-option|.

	It is not allowed to change text or jump to another window while
	evaluating 'statusline' |textlock|.

	If the statusline is not updated when you want it (e.g., after setting
	a variable that's used in an expression), you can force an update by
	setting an option without changing its value.  Example: >
		:let &ro = &ro

<	A result of all digits is regarded a number for display purposes.
	Otherwise the result is taken as flag text and applied to the rules
	described above.

	Watch out for errors in expressions.  They may render Vim unusable!
	If you are stuck, hold down ':' or 'Q' to get a prompt, then quit and
	edit your .vimrc or whatever with "vim -u NONE" to get it right.

	Examples:

						*'suffixes'* *'su'*
'suffixes' 'su'		string	(default ".bak,~,.o,.h,.info,.swp,.obj")
			global
			{not in Vi}
	Files with these suffixes get a lower priority when multiple files
	match a wildcard.  See |suffixes|.  Commas can be used to separate the
	suffixes.  Spaces after the comma are ignored.  A dot is also seen as
	the start of a suffix.  To avoid a dot or comma being recognized as a
	separator, precede it with a backslash (see |option-backslash| about
	including spaces and backslashes).
	See 'wildignore' for completely ignoring files.
	The use of |:set+=| and |:set-=| is preferred when adding or removing
	suffixes from the list.  This avoids problems when a future version
	uses another default.

						*'suffixesadd'* *'sua'*
'suffixesadd' 'sua'	string	(default "")
			local to buffer
			{not in Vi}
			{not available when compiled without the
			|+file_in_path| feature}
	Comma separated list of suffixes, which are used when searching for a
	file for the "gf", "[I", etc. commands.  Example: >
		:set suffixesadd=.java
<
				*'swapfile'* *'swf'* *'noswapfile'* *'noswf'*
'swapfile' 'swf'	boolean (default on)
			local to buffer
			{not in Vi}
	Use a swapfile for the buffer.  This option can be reset when a
	swapfile is not wanted for a specific buffer.  For example, with
	confidential information that even root must not be able to access.
	Careful: All text will be in memory:
		- Don't use this for big files.
		- Recovery will be impossible!
	A swapfile will only be present when |'updatecount'| is non-zero and
	'swapfile' is set.
	When 'swapfile' is reset, the swap file for the current buffer is
	immediately deleted.  When 'swapfile' is set, and 'updatecount' is
	non-zero, a swap file is immediately created.
	Also see |swap-file| and |'swapsync'|.
	If you want to open a new buffer without creating a swap file for it,
	use the |:noswapfile| modifier.

	This option is used together with 'bufhidden' and 'buftype' to
	specify special kinds of buffers.   See |special-buffers|.

						*'swapsync'* *'sws'*
'swapsync' 'sws'	string	(default "fsync")
			global
			{not in Vi}
	When this option is not empty a swap file is synced to disk after
	writing to it.  This takes some time, especially on busy unix systems.
	When this option is empty parts of the swap file may be in memory and
	not written to disk.  When the system crashes you may lose more work.
	On Unix the system does a sync now and then without Vim asking for it,
	so the disadvantage of setting this option off is small.  On some
	systems the swap file will not be written at all.  For a unix system
	setting it to "sync" will use the sync() call instead of the default
	fsync(), which may work better on some systems.
	The 'fsync' option is used for the actual file.

						*'switchbuf'* *'swb'*
'switchbuf' 'swb'	string	(default "")
			global
			{not in Vi}
	This option controls the behavior when switching between buffers.
	Possible values (comma separated list):
	   useopen	If included, jump to the first open window that
			contains the specified buffer (if there is one).
			Otherwise: Do not examine other windows.
			This setting is checked with |quickfix| commands, when
			jumping to errors (":cc", ":cn", "cp", etc.).  It is
			also used in all buffer related split commands, for
			example ":sbuffer", ":sbnext", or ":sbrewind".
	   usetab	Like "useopen", but also consider windows in other tab
			pages.
	   split	If included, split the current window before loading
			a buffer for a |quickfix| command that display errors.
			Otherwise: do not split, use current window.
	   newtab	Like "split", but open a new tab page.  Overrules
			"split" when both are present.

						*'synmaxcol'* *'smc'*
'synmaxcol' 'smc'	number	(default 3000)
			local to buffer
			{not in Vi}
			{not available when compiled without the |+syntax|
			feature}
	Maximum column in which to search for syntax items.  In long lines the
	text after this column is not highlighted and following lines may not
	be highlighted correctly, because the syntax state is cleared.
	This helps to avoid very slow redrawing for an XML file that is one
	long line.
	Set to zero to remove the limit.

						*'syntax'* *'syn'*
'syntax' 'syn'		string	(default empty)
			local to buffer
			{not in Vi}
			{not available when compiled without the |+syntax|
			feature}
	When this option is set, the syntax with this name is loaded, unless
	syntax highlighting has been switched off with ":syntax off".
	Otherwise this option does not always reflect the current syntax (the
	b:current_syntax variable does).
	This option is most useful in a modeline, for a file which syntax is
	not automatically recognized.  Example, in an IDL file:
		/* vim: set syntax=idl : */ ~
	When a dot appears in the value then this separates two filetype
	names.  Example:
		/* vim: set syntax=c.doxygen : */ ~
	This will use the "c" syntax first, then the "doxygen" syntax.
	Note that the second one must be prepared to be loaded as an addition,
	otherwise it will be skipped.  More than one dot may appear.
	To switch off syntax highlighting for the current file, use: >
		:set syntax=OFF
<	To switch syntax highlighting on according to the current value of the
	'filetype' option: >
		:set syntax=ON
<	What actually happens when setting the 'syntax' option is that the
	Syntax autocommand event is triggered with the value as argument.
	This option is not copied to another buffer, independent of the 's' or
	'S' flag in 'cpoptions'.
	Only normal file name characters can be used, "/\*?[|<>" are illegal.

						*'tabline'* *'tal'*
'tabline' 'tal'		string	(default empty)
			global
			{not in Vi}
			{not available when compiled without the |+windows|
			feature}
	When nonempty, this option determines the content of the tab pages
	line at the top of the Vim window.  When empty Vim will use a default
	tab pages line.  See |setting-tabline| for more info.

	The tab pages line only appears as specified with the 'showtabline'
	option and only when there is no GUI tab line.  When 'e' is in
	'guioptions' and the GUI supports a tab line 'guitablabel' is used
	instead.  Note that the two tab pages lines are very different.

	The value is evaluated like with 'statusline'.  You can use
	|tabpagenr()|, |tabpagewinnr()| and |tabpagebuflist()| to figure out
	the text to be displayed.  Use "%1T" for the first label, "%2T" for
	the second one, etc.  Use "%X" items for closing labels.

	Keep in mind that only one of the tab pages is the current one, others
	are invisible and you can't jump to their windows.


						*'tabpagemax'* *'tpm'*
'tabpagemax' 'tpm'	number	(default 10)
			global
			{not in Vi}
			{not available when compiled without the |+windows|
			feature}
	Maximum number of tab pages to be opened by the |-p| command line
	argument or the ":tab all" command. |tabpage|


						*'tabstop'* *'ts'*
'tabstop' 'ts'		number	(default 8)
			local to buffer
	Number of spaces that a <Tab> in the file counts for.  Also see
	|:retab| command, and 'softtabstop' option.

	Note: Setting 'tabstop' to any other value than 8 can make your file
	appear wrong in many places (e.g., when printing it).

	There are four main ways to use tabs in Vim:
	1. Always keep 'tabstop' at 8, set 'softtabstop' and 'shiftwidth' to 4
	   (or 3 or whatever you prefer) and use 'noexpandtab'.  Then Vim
	   will use a mix of tabs and spaces, but typing <Tab> and <BS> will
	   behave like a tab appears every 4 (or 3) characters.
	2. Set 'tabstop' and 'shiftwidth' to whatever you prefer and use
	   'expandtab'.  This way you will always insert spaces.  The
	   formatting will never be messed up when 'tabstop' is changed.
	3. Set 'tabstop' and 'shiftwidth' to whatever you prefer and use a
	   |modeline| to set these values when editing the file again.  Only
	   works when using Vim to edit the file.
	4. Always set 'tabstop' and 'shiftwidth' to the same value, and
	   'noexpandtab'.  This should then work (for initial indents only)
	   for any tabstop setting that people use.  It might be nice to have
	   tabs after the first non-blank inserted as spaces if you do this
	   though.  Otherwise aligned comments will be wrong when 'tabstop' is
	   changed.

			*'tagbsearch'* *'tbs'* *'notagbsearch'* *'notbs'*
'tagbsearch' 'tbs'	boolean	(default on)
			global
			{not in Vi}
	When searching for a tag (e.g., for the |:ta| command), Vim can either
	use a binary search or a linear search in a tags file.  Binary
	searching makes searching for a tag a LOT faster, but a linear search
	will find more tags if the tags file wasn't properly sorted.
	Vim normally assumes that your tags files are sorted, or indicate that
	they are not sorted.  Only when this is not the case does the
	'tagbsearch' option need to be switched off.

	When 'tagbsearch' is on, binary searching is first used in the tags
	files.  In certain situations, Vim will do a linear search instead for
	certain files, or retry all files with a linear search.  When
	'tagbsearch' is off, only a linear search is done.

	Linear searching is done anyway, for one file, when Vim finds a line
	at the start of the file indicating that it's not sorted: >
   !_TAG_FILE_SORTED	0	/some comment/
<	[The whitespace before and after the '0' must be a single <Tab>]

	When a binary search was done and no match was found in any of the
	files listed in 'tags', and 'ignorecase' is set or a pattern is used
	instead of a normal tag name, a retry is done with a linear search.
	Tags in unsorted tags files, and matches with different case will only
	be found in the retry.

	If a tag file indicates that it is case-fold sorted, the second,
	linear search can be avoided for the 'ignorecase' case.  Use a value
	of '2' in the "!_TAG_FILE_SORTED" line for this.  A tag file can be
	case-fold sorted with the -f switch to "sort" in most unices, as in
	the command: "sort -f -o tags tags".  For "Exuberant ctags" version
	5.x or higher (at least 5.5) the --sort=foldcase switch can be used
	for this as well.  Note that case must be folded to uppercase for this
	to work.

	When 'tagbsearch' is off, tags searching is slower when a full match
	exists, but faster when no full match exists.  Tags in unsorted tags
	files may only be found with 'tagbsearch' off.
	When the tags file is not sorted, or sorted in a wrong way (not on
	ASCII byte value), 'tagbsearch' should be off, or the line given above
	must be included in the tags file.
	This option doesn't affect commands that find all matching tags (e.g.,
	command-line completion and ":help").
	{Vi: always uses binary search in some versions}

						*'taglength'* *'tl'*
'taglength' 'tl'	number	(default 0)
			global
	If non-zero, tags are significant up to this number of characters.

			*'tagrelative'* *'tr'* *'notagrelative'* *'notr'*
'tagrelative' 'tr'	boolean	(Vim default: on, Vi default: off)
			global
			{not in Vi}
	If on and using a tags file in another directory, file names in that
	tags file are relative to the directory where the tags file is.
	NOTE: This option is set to the Vi default value when 'compatible' is
	set and to the Vim default value when 'compatible' is reset.

						*'tags'* *'tag'* *E433*
'tags' 'tag'		string	(default "./tags,tags", when compiled with
				|+emacs_tags|: "./tags,./TAGS,tags,TAGS")
			global or local to buffer |global-local|
	Filenames for the tag command, separated by spaces or commas.  To
	include a space or comma in a file name, precede it with a backslash
	(see |option-backslash| about including spaces and backslashes).
	When a file name starts with "./", the '.' is replaced with the path
	of the current file.  But only when the 'd' flag is not included in
	'cpoptions'.  Environment variables are expanded |:set_env|.  Also see
	|tags-option|.
	"*", "**" and other wildcards can be used to search for tags files in
	a directory tree.  See |file-searching|.  E.g., "/lib/**/tags" will
	find all files named "tags" below "/lib".  The filename itself cannot
	contain wildcards, it is used as-is.  E.g., "/lib/**/tags?" will find
	files called "tags?".  {not available when compiled without the
	|+path_extra| feature}
	The |tagfiles()| function can be used to get a list of the file names
	actually used.
	If Vim was compiled with the |+emacs_tags| feature, Emacs-style tag
	files are also supported.  They are automatically recognized.  The
	default value becomes "./tags,./TAGS,tags,TAGS", unless case
	differences are ignored (MS-Windows).  |emacs-tags|
	The use of |:set+=| and |:set-=| is preferred when adding or removing
	file names from the list.  This avoids problems when a future version
	uses another default.
	{Vi: default is "tags /usr/lib/tags"}

				*'tagstack'* *'tgst'* *'notagstack'* *'notgst'*
'tagstack' 'tgst'	boolean	(default on)
			global
			{not in all versions of Vi}
	When on, the |tagstack| is used normally.  When off, a ":tag" or
	":tselect" command with an argument will not push the tag onto the
	tagstack.  A following ":tag" without an argument, a ":pop" command or
	any other command that uses the tagstack will use the unmodified
	tagstack, but does change the pointer to the active entry.
	Resetting this option is useful when using a ":tag" command in a
	mapping which should not change the tagstack.

						*'term'* *E529* *E530* *E531*
'term'			string	(default is $TERM, if that fails:
				      in the GUI: "builtin_gui"
					on Amiga: "amiga"
					 on BeOS: "beos-ansi"
					  on Mac: "mac-ansi"
					 on MiNT: "vt52"
				       on MS-DOS: "pcterm"
					 on OS/2: "os2ansi"
					 on Unix: "ansi"
					  on VMS: "ansi"
				       on Win 32: "win32")
			global
	Name of the terminal.  Used for choosing the terminal control
	characters.  Environment variables are expanded |:set_env|.
	For example: >
		:set term=$TERM
<	See |termcap|.

						*'termbidi'* *'tbidi'*
						*'notermbidi'* *'notbidi'*
'termbidi' 'tbidi'	boolean (default off, on for "mlterm")
			global
			{not in Vi}
			{only available when compiled with the |+arabic|
			feature}
	The terminal is in charge of Bi-directionality of text (as specified
	by Unicode).  The terminal is also expected to do the required shaping
	that some languages (such as Arabic) require.
	Setting this option implies that 'rightleft' will not be set when
	'arabic' is set and the value of 'arabicshape' will be ignored.
	Note that setting 'termbidi' has the immediate effect that
	'arabicshape' is ignored, but 'rightleft' isn't changed automatically.
	This option is reset when the GUI is started.
	For further details see |arabic.txt|.

					*'termencoding'* *'tenc'*
'termencoding' 'tenc'	string	(default ""; with GTK+ 2 GUI: "utf-8"; with
						    Macintosh GUI: "macroman")
			global
			{only available when compiled with the |+multi_byte|
			feature}
			{not in Vi}
	Encoding used for the terminal.  This specifies what character
	encoding the keyboard produces and the display will understand.  For
	the GUI it only applies to the keyboard ( 'encoding' is used for the
	display).  Except for the Mac when 'macatsui' is off, then
	'termencoding' should be "macroman".
	In the Win32 console version the default value is the console codepage
	when it differs from the ANSI codepage.
								*E617*
	Note: This does not apply to the GTK+ 2 GUI.  After the GUI has been
	successfully initialized, 'termencoding' is forcibly set to "utf-8".
	Any attempts to set a different value will be rejected, and an error
	message is shown.
	For the Win32 GUI 'termencoding' is not used for typed characters,
	because the Win32 system always passes Unicode characters.
	When empty, the same encoding is used as for the 'encoding' option.
	This is the normal value.
	Not all combinations for 'termencoding' and 'encoding' are valid.  See
	|encoding-table|.
	The value for this option must be supported by internal conversions or
	iconv().  When this is not possible no conversion will be done and you
	will probably experience problems with non-ASCII characters.
	Example: You are working with the locale set to euc-jp (Japanese) and
	want to edit a UTF-8 file: >
		:let &termencoding = &encoding
		:set encoding=utf-8
<	You need to do this when your system has no locale support for UTF-8.

						*'terse'* *'noterse'*
'terse'			boolean	(default off)
			global
	When set: Add 's' flag to 'shortmess' option (this makes the message
	for a search that hits the start or end of the file not being
	displayed).  When reset: Remove 's' flag from 'shortmess' option.  {Vi
	shortens a lot of messages}

				   *'textauto'* *'ta'* *'notextauto'* *'nota'*
'textauto' 'ta'		boolean	(Vim default: on, Vi default: off)
			global
			{not in Vi}
	This option is obsolete.  Use 'fileformats'.
	For backwards compatibility, when 'textauto' is set, 'fileformats' is
	set to the default value for the current system.  When 'textauto' is
	reset, 'fileformats' is made empty.
	NOTE: This option is set to the Vi default value when 'compatible' is
	set and to the Vim default value when 'compatible' is reset.

				   *'textmode'* *'tx'* *'notextmode'* *'notx'*
'textmode' 'tx'		boolean	(MS-DOS, Win32 and OS/2: default on,
				 others: default off)
			local to buffer
			{not in Vi}
	This option is obsolete.  Use 'fileformat'.
	For backwards compatibility, when 'textmode' is set, 'fileformat' is
	set to "dos".  When 'textmode' is reset, 'fileformat' is set to
	"unix".

						*'textwidth'* *'tw'*
'textwidth' 'tw'	number	(default 0)
			local to buffer
			{not in Vi}
	Maximum width of text that is being inserted.  A longer line will be
	broken after white space to get this width.  A zero value disables
	this.  'textwidth' is set to 0 when the 'paste' option is set.  When
	'textwidth' is zero, 'wrapmargin' may be used.  See also
	'formatoptions' and |ins-textwidth|.
	When 'formatexpr' is set it will be used to break the line.
	NOTE: This option is set to 0 when 'compatible' is set.

						*'thesaurus'* *'tsr'*
'thesaurus' 'tsr'	string	(default "")
			global or local to buffer |global-local|
			{not in Vi}
	List of file names, separated by commas, that are used to lookup words
	for thesaurus completion commands |i_CTRL-X_CTRL-T|.  Each line in
	the file should contain words with similar meaning, separated by
	non-keyword characters (white space is preferred).  Maximum line
	length is 510 bytes.
	To obtain a file to be used here, check out this ftp site:
	ftp://ftp.ox.ac.uk/pub/wordlists/  First get the README file.
	To include a comma in a file name precede it with a backslash.  Spaces
	after a comma are ignored, otherwise spaces are included in the file
	name.  See |option-backslash| about using backslashes.
	The use of |:set+=| and |:set-=| is preferred when adding or removing
	directories from the list.  This avoids problems when a future version
	uses another default.
	Backticks cannot be used in this option for security reasons.

			     *'tildeop'* *'top'* *'notildeop'* *'notop'*
'tildeop' 'top'		boolean	(default off)
			global
			{not in Vi}
	When on: The tilde command "~" behaves like an operator.
	NOTE: This option is reset when 'compatible' is set.

				*'timeout'* *'to'* *'notimeout'* *'noto'*
'timeout' 'to'		boolean (default on)
			global
						*'ttimeout'* *'nottimeout'*
'ttimeout'		boolean (default off)
			global
			{not in Vi}
	These two options together determine the behavior when part of a
	mapped key sequence or keyboard code has been received:

	'timeout'    'ttimeout'		action	~
	   off		off		do not time out
	   on		on or off	time out on :mappings and key codes
	   off		on		time out on key codes

	If both options are off, Vim will wait until either the complete
	mapping or key sequence has been received, or it is clear that there
	is no mapping or key sequence for the received characters.  For
	example: if you have mapped "vl" and Vim has received 'v', the next
	character is needed to see if the 'v' is followed by an 'l'.
	When one of the options is on, Vim will wait for about 1 second for
	the next character to arrive.  After that the already received
	characters are interpreted as single characters.  The waiting time can
	be changed with the 'timeoutlen' option.
	On slow terminals or very busy systems timing out may cause
	malfunctioning cursor keys.  If both options are off, Vim waits
	forever after an entered <Esc> if there are key codes that start
	with <Esc>.  You will have to type <Esc> twice.  If you do not have
	problems with key codes, but would like to have :mapped key
	sequences not timing out in 1 second, set the 'ttimeout' option and
	reset the 'timeout' option.

	NOTE: 'ttimeout' is reset when 'compatible' is set.

						*'timeoutlen'* *'tm'*
'timeoutlen' 'tm'	number	(default 1000)
			global
			{not in all versions of Vi}
						*'ttimeoutlen'* *'ttm'*
'ttimeoutlen' 'ttm'	number	(default -1)
			global
			{not in Vi}
	The time in milliseconds that is waited for a key code or mapped key
	sequence to complete.  Also used for CTRL-\ CTRL-N and CTRL-\ CTRL-G
	when part of a command has been typed.
	Normally only 'timeoutlen' is used and 'ttimeoutlen' is -1.  When a
	different timeout value for key codes is desired set 'ttimeoutlen' to
	a non-negative number.

		ttimeoutlen	mapping delay	   key code delay	~
		   < 0		'timeoutlen'	   'timeoutlen'
		  >= 0		'timeoutlen'	   'ttimeoutlen'

	The timeout only happens when the 'timeout' and 'ttimeout' options
	tell so.  A useful setting would be >
		:set timeout timeoutlen=3000 ttimeoutlen=100
<	(time out on mapping after three seconds, time out on key codes after
	a tenth of a second).

						*'title'* *'notitle'*
'title'			boolean	(default off, on when title can be restored)
			global
			{not in Vi}
			{not available when compiled without the |+title|
			feature}
	When on, the title of the window will be set to the value of
	'titlestring' (if it is not empty), or to:
		filename [+=-] (path) - VIM
	Where:
		filename	the name of the file being edited
		-		indicates the file cannot be modified, 'ma' off
		+		indicates the file was modified
		=		indicates the file is read-only
		=+		indicates the file is read-only and modified
		(path)		is the path of the file being edited
		- VIM		the server name |v:servername| or "VIM"
	Only works if the terminal supports setting window titles
	(currently Amiga console, Win32 console, all GUI versions and
	terminals with a non- empty 't_ts' option - these are Unix xterm and
	iris-ansi by default, where 't_ts' is taken from the builtin termcap).
								*X11*
	When Vim was compiled with HAVE_X11 defined, the original title will
	be restored if possible.  The output of ":version" will include "+X11"
	when HAVE_X11 was defined, otherwise it will be "-X11".  This also
	works for the icon name |'icon'|.
	But: When Vim was started with the |-X| argument, restoring the title
	will not work (except in the GUI).
	If the title cannot be restored, it is set to the value of 'titleold'.
	You might want to restore the title outside of Vim then.
	When using an xterm from a remote machine you can use this command:
	    rsh machine_name xterm -display $DISPLAY &
	then the WINDOWID environment variable should be inherited and the
	title of the window should change back to what it should be after
	exiting Vim.

								*'titlelen'*
'titlelen'		number	(default 85)
			global
			{not in Vi}
			{not available when compiled without the |+title|
			feature}
	Gives the percentage of 'columns' to use for the length of the window
	title.  When the title is longer, only the end of the path name is
	shown.  A '<' character before the path name is used to indicate this.
	Using a percentage makes this adapt to the width of the window.  But
	it won't work perfectly, because the actual number of characters
	available also depends on the font used and other things in the title
	bar.  When 'titlelen' is zero the full path is used.  Otherwise,
	values from 1 to 30000 percent can be used.
	'titlelen' is also used for the 'titlestring' option.

						*'titleold'*
'titleold'		string	(default "Thanks for flying Vim")
			global
			{not in Vi}
			{only available when compiled with the |+title|
			feature}
	This option will be used for the window title when exiting Vim if the
	original title cannot be restored.  Only happens if 'title' is on or
	'titlestring' is not empty.
	This option cannot be set from a |modeline| or in the |sandbox|, for
	security reasons.
						*'titlestring'*
'titlestring'		string	(default "")
			global
			{not in Vi}
			{not available when compiled without the |+title|
			feature}
	When this option is not empty, it will be used for the title of the
	window.  This happens only when the 'title' option is on.
	Only works if the terminal supports setting window titles (currently
	Amiga console, Win32 console, all GUI versions and terminals with a
	non-empty 't_ts' option).
	When Vim was compiled with HAVE_X11 defined, the original title will
	be restored if possible |X11|.
	When this option contains printf-style '%' items, they will be
	expanded according to the rules used for 'statusline'.
	Example: >
    :auto BufEnter * let &titlestring = hostname() . "/" . expand("%:p")
    :set title titlestring=%<%F%=%l/%L-%P titlelen=70
<	The value of 'titlelen' is used to align items in the middle or right
	of the available space.
	Some people prefer to have the file name first: >
    :set titlestring=%t%(\ %M%)%(\ (%{expand(\"%:~:.:h\")})%)%(\ %a%)
<	Note the use of "%{ }" and an expression to get the path of the file,
	without the file name.  The "%( %)" constructs are used to add a
	separating space only when needed.
	NOTE: Use of special characters in 'titlestring' may cause the display
	to be garbled (e.g., when it contains a CR or NL character).
	{not available when compiled without the |+statusline| feature}

				*'toolbar'* *'tb'*
'toolbar' 'tb'		string	(default "icons,tooltips")
			global
			{only for |+GUI_GTK|, |+GUI_Athena|, |+GUI_Motif| and
			|+GUI_Photon|}
	The contents of this option controls various toolbar settings.  The
	possible values are:
		icons		Toolbar buttons are shown with icons.
		text		Toolbar buttons shown with text.
		horiz		Icon and text of a toolbar button are
				horizontally arranged.  {only in GTK+ 2 GUI}
		tooltips	Tooltips are active for toolbar buttons.
	Tooltips refer to the popup help text which appears after the mouse
	cursor is placed over a toolbar button for a brief moment.

	If you want the toolbar to be shown with icons as well as text, do the
	following: >
		:set tb=icons,text
<	Motif and Athena cannot display icons and text at the same time.  They
	will show icons if both are requested.

	If none of the strings specified in 'toolbar' are valid or if
	'toolbar' is empty, this option is ignored.  If you want to disable
	the toolbar, you need to set the 'guioptions' option.  For example: >
		:set guioptions-=T
<	Also see |gui-toolbar|.

						*'toolbariconsize'* *'tbis'*
'toolbariconsize' 'tbis'	string	(default "small")
				global
				{not in Vi}
				{only in the GTK+ 2 GUI}
	Controls the size of toolbar icons.  The possible values are:
		tiny		Use tiny toolbar icons.
		small		Use small toolbar icons (default).
		medium		Use medium-sized toolbar icons.
		large		Use large toolbar icons.
	The exact dimensions in pixels of the various icon sizes depend on
	the current theme.  Common dimensions are large=32x32, medium=24x24,
	small=20x20 and tiny=16x16.

	If 'toolbariconsize' is empty, the global default size as determined
	by user preferences or the current theme is used.

			     *'ttybuiltin'* *'tbi'* *'nottybuiltin'* *'notbi'*
'ttybuiltin' 'tbi'	boolean	(default on)
			global
			{not in Vi}
	When on, the builtin termcaps are searched before the external ones.
	When off the builtin termcaps are searched after the external ones.
	When this option is changed, you should set the 'term' option next for
	the change to take effect, for example: >
		:set notbi term=$TERM
<	See also |termcap|.
	Rationale: The default for this option is "on", because the builtin
	termcap entries are generally better (many systems contain faulty
	xterm entries...).

				     *'ttyfast'* *'tf'* *'nottyfast'* *'notf'*
'ttyfast' 'tf'		boolean	(default off, on when 'term' is xterm, hpterm,
					sun-cmd, screen, rxvt, dtterm or
					iris-ansi; also on when running Vim in
					a DOS console)
			global
			{not in Vi}
	Indicates a fast terminal connection.  More characters will be sent to
	the screen for redrawing, instead of using insert/delete line
	commands.  Improves smoothness of redrawing when there are multiple
	windows and the terminal does not support a scrolling region.
	Also enables the extra writing of characters at the end of each screen
	line for lines that wrap.  This helps when using copy/paste with the
	mouse in an xterm and other terminals.

						*'ttymouse'* *'ttym'*
'ttymouse' 'ttym'	string	(default depends on 'term')
			global
			{not in Vi}
			{only in Unix and VMS, doesn't work in the GUI; not
			available when compiled without |+mouse|}
	Name of the terminal type for which mouse codes are to be recognized.
	Currently these strings are valid:
							*xterm-mouse*
	   xterm	xterm-like mouse handling.  The mouse generates
			"<Esc>[Mscr", where "scr" is three bytes:
				"s"  = button state
				"c"  = column plus 33
				"r"  = row plus 33
			This only works up to 223 columns!  See "dec",
			"urxvt", and "sgr" for solutions.
	   xterm2	Works like "xterm", but with the xterm reporting the
			mouse position while the mouse is dragged.  This works
			much faster and more precise.  Your xterm must at
			least at patchlevel 88 / XFree 3.3.3 for this to
			work.  See below for how Vim detects this
			automatically.
							*netterm-mouse*
	   netterm	NetTerm mouse handling.  The mouse generates
			"<Esc>}r,c<CR>", where "r,c" are two decimal numbers
			for the row and column.
							*dec-mouse*
	   dec		DEC terminal mouse handling.  The mouse generates a
			rather complex sequence, starting with "<Esc>[".
			This is also available for an Xterm, if it was
			configured with "--enable-dec-locator".
							*jsbterm-mouse*
	   jsbterm	JSB term mouse handling.
							*pterm-mouse*
	   pterm	QNX pterm mouse handling.
							*urxvt-mouse*
	   urxvt	Mouse handling for the urxvt (rxvt-unicode) terminal.
			The mouse works only if the terminal supports this
			encoding style, but it does not have 223 columns limit
			unlike "xterm" or "xterm2".
							*sgr-mouse*
	   sgr		Mouse handling for the terminal that emits SGR-styled
			mouse reporting.  The mouse works even in columns
			beyond 223.  This option is backward compatible with
			"xterm2" because it can also decode "xterm2" style
			mouse codes.

	The mouse handling must be enabled at compile time |+mouse_xterm|
	|+mouse_dec| |+mouse_netterm| |+mouse_jsbterm| |+mouse_urxvt|
	|+mouse_sgr|.
	Only "xterm"(2) is really recognized.  NetTerm mouse codes are always
	recognized, if enabled at compile time.  DEC terminal mouse codes
	are recognized if enabled at compile time, and 'ttymouse' is not
	"xterm", "xterm2", "urxvt" or "sgr" (because dec mouse codes conflict
	with them).
	This option is automatically set to "xterm", when the 'term' option is
	set to a name that starts with "xterm", "mlterm", or "screen", and
	'ttymouse' is not set already.
	Additionally, if vim is compiled with the |+termresponse| feature and
	|t_RV| is set to the escape sequence to request the xterm version
	number, more intelligent detection process runs.
	The "xterm2" value will be set if the xterm version is reported to be
	from 95 to 276.  The "sgr" value will be set if the xterm version is
	277 or highter.
	If you do not want 'ttymouse' to be set to "xterm2" or "sgr"
	automatically, set t_RV to an empty string: >
		:set t_RV=
<
						*'ttyscroll'* *'tsl'*
'ttyscroll' 'tsl'	number	(default 999)
			global
	Maximum number of lines to scroll the screen.  If there are more lines
	to scroll the window is redrawn.  For terminals where scrolling is
	very slow and redrawing is not slow this can be set to a small number,
	e.g., 3, to speed up displaying.

						*'ttytype'* *'tty'*
'ttytype' 'tty'		string	(default from $TERM)
			global
	Alias for 'term', see above.

						*'undodir'* *'udir'*
'undodir' 'udir'	string	(default ".")
			global
			{not in Vi}
			{only when compiled with the |+persistent_undo| feature}
	List of directory names for undo files, separated with commas.
	See |'backupdir'| for details of the format.
	"." means using the directory of the file.  The undo file name for
	"file.txt" is ".file.txt.un~".
	For other directories the file name is the full path of the edited
	file, with path separators replaced with "%".
	When writing: The first directory that exists is used. "." always
	works, no directories after "." will be used for writing.
	When reading all entries are tried to find an undo file.  The first
	undo file that exists is used.  When it cannot be read an error is
	given, no further entry is used.
	See |undo-persistence|.

				*'undofile'* *'noundofile'* *'udf'* *'noudf'*
'undofile' 'udf'	boolean	(default off)
			local to buffer
			{not in Vi}
			{only when compiled with the |+persistent_undo| feature}
	When on, Vim automatically saves undo history to an undo file when
	writing a buffer to a file, and restores undo history from the same
	file on buffer read.
	The directory where the undo file is stored is specified by 'undodir'.
	For more information about this feature see |undo-persistence|.
	The undo file is not read when 'undoreload' causes the buffer from
	before a reload to be saved for undo.
	When 'undofile' is turned off the undo file is NOT deleted.

						*'undolevels'* *'ul'*
'undolevels' 'ul'	number	(default 100, 1000 for Unix, VMS,
						Win32 and OS/2)
			global or local to buffer |global-local|
			{not in Vi}
	Maximum number of changes that can be undone.  Since undo information
	is kept in memory, higher numbers will cause more memory to be used
	(nevertheless, a single change can use an unlimited amount of memory).
	Set to 0 for Vi compatibility: One level of undo and "u" undoes
	itself: >
		set ul=0
<	But you can also get Vi compatibility by including the 'u' flag in
	'cpoptions', and still be able to use CTRL-R to repeat undo.
	Also see |undo-two-ways|.
	Set to -1 for no undo at all.  You might want to do this only for the
	current buffer: >
		setlocal ul=-1
<	This helps when you run out of memory for a single change.
	Also see |clear-undo|.

						*'undoreload'* *'ur'*
'undoreload' 'ur'	number	(default 10000)
			global
			{not in Vi}
	Save the whole buffer for undo when reloading it.  This applies to the
	":e!" command and reloading for when the buffer changed outside of
	Vim. |FileChangedShell|
	The save only happens when this options is negative or when the number
	of lines is smaller than the value of this option.
	Set this option to zero to disable undo for a reload.

	When saving undo for a reload, any undo file is not read.

	Note that this causes the whole buffer to be stored in memory.  Set
	this option to a lower value if you run out of memory.

						*'updatecount'* *'uc'*
'updatecount' 'uc'	number	(default: 200)
			global
			{not in Vi}
	After typing this many characters the swap file will be written to
	disk.  When zero, no swap file will be created at all (see chapter on
	recovery |crash-recovery|).  'updatecount' is set to zero by starting
	Vim with the "-n" option, see |startup|.  When editing in readonly
	mode this option will be initialized to 10000.
	The swapfile can be disabled per buffer with |'swapfile'|.
	When 'updatecount' is set from zero to non-zero, swap files are
	created for all buffers that have 'swapfile' set.  When 'updatecount'
	is set to zero, existing swap files are not deleted.
	Also see |'swapsync'|.
	This option has no meaning in buffers where |'buftype'| is "nofile"
	or "nowrite".

						*'updatetime'* *'ut'*
'updatetime' 'ut'	number	(default 4000)
			global
			{not in Vi}
	If this many milliseconds nothing is typed the swap file will be
	written to disk (see |crash-recovery|).  Also used for the
	|CursorHold| autocommand event.

						*'verbose'* *'vbs'*
'verbose' 'vbs'		number	(default 0)
			global
			{not in Vi, although some versions have a boolean
			verbose option}
	When bigger than zero, Vim will give messages about what it is doing.
	Currently, these messages are given:
	>= 1	When the viminfo file is read or written.
	>= 2	When a file is ":source"'ed.
	>= 5	Every searched tags file and include file.
	>= 8	Files for which a group of autocommands is executed.
	>= 9	Every executed autocommand.
	>= 12	Every executed function.
	>= 13	When an exception is thrown, caught, finished, or discarded.
	>= 14	Anything pending in a ":finally" clause.
	>= 15	Every executed Ex command (truncated at 200 characters).

	This option can also be set with the "-V" argument.  See |-V|.
	This option is also set by the |:verbose| command.

	When the 'verbosefile' option is set then the verbose messages are not
	displayed.

						*'verbosefile'* *'vfile'*
'verbosefile' 'vfile'	string	(default empty)
			global
			{not in Vi}
	When not empty all messages are written in a file with this name.
	When the file exists messages are appended.
	Writing to the file ends when Vim exits or when 'verbosefile' is made
	empty.  Writes are buffered, thus may not show up for some time.
	Setting 'verbosefile' to a new value is like making it empty first.
	The difference with |:redir| is that verbose messages are not
	displayed when 'verbosefile' is set.

						*'viewdir'* *'vdir'*
'viewdir' 'vdir'	string	(default for Amiga, MS-DOS, OS/2 and Win32:
							 "$VIM/vimfiles/view",
				 for Unix: "~/.vim/view",
				 for Macintosh: "$VIM:vimfiles:view"
				 for VMS: "sys$login:vimfiles/view"
				 for RiscOS: "Choices:vimfiles/view")
			global
			{not in Vi}
			{not available when compiled without the |+mksession|
			feature}
	Name of the directory where to store files for |:mkview|.
	This option cannot be set from a |modeline| or in the |sandbox|, for
	security reasons.

						*'viewoptions'* *'vop'*
'viewoptions' 'vop'	string	(default: "folds,options,cursor")
			global
			{not in Vi}
			{not available when compiled without the |+mksession|
			feature}
	Changes the effect of the |:mkview| command.  It is a comma separated
	list of words.  Each word enables saving and restoring something:
	   word		save and restore ~
	   cursor	cursor position in file and in window
	   folds	manually created folds, opened/closed folds and local
			fold options
	   options	options and mappings local to a window or buffer (not
			global values for local options)
	   localoptions same as "options"
	   slash	backslashes in file names replaced with forward
			slashes
	   unix		with Unix end-of-line format (single <NL>), even when
			on Windows or DOS

	"slash" and "unix" are useful on Windows when sharing view files
	with Unix.  The Unix version of Vim cannot source dos format scripts,
	but the Windows version of Vim can source unix format scripts.

				*'viminfo'* *'vi'* *E526* *E527* *E528*
'viminfo' 'vi'		string	(Vi default: "", Vim default for MS-DOS,
				   Windows and OS/2: '100,<50,s10,h,rA:,rB:,
				   for Amiga: '100,<50,s10,h,rdf0:,rdf1:,rdf2:
				   for others: '100,<50,s10,h)
			global
			{not in Vi}
			{not available when compiled without the |+viminfo|
			feature}
	When non-empty, the viminfo file is read upon startup and written
	when exiting Vim (see |viminfo-file|).  The string should be a comma
	separated list of parameters, each consisting of a single character
	identifying the particular parameter, followed by a number or string
	which specifies the value of that parameter.  If a particular
	character is left out, then the default value is used for that
	parameter.  The following is a list of the identifying characters and
	the effect of their value.
	CHAR	VALUE	~
							*viminfo-!*
	!	When included, save and restore global variables that start
		with an uppercase letter, and don't contain a lowercase
		letter.  Thus "KEEPTHIS and "K_L_M" are stored, but "KeepThis"
		and "_K_L_M" are not.  Nested List and Dict items may not be
		read back correctly, you end up with an empty item.
							*viminfo-quote*
	"	Maximum number of lines saved for each register.  Old name of
		the '<' item, with the disadvantage that you need to put a
		backslash before the ", otherwise it will be recognized as the
		start of a comment!
							*viminfo-%*
	%	When included, save and restore the buffer list.  If Vim is
		started with a file name argument, the buffer list is not
		restored.  If Vim is started without a file name argument, the
		buffer list is restored from the viminfo file.  Buffers
		without a file name and buffers for help files are not written
		to the viminfo file.
		When followed by a number, the number specifies the maximum
		number of buffers that are stored.  Without a number all
		buffers are stored.
							*viminfo-'*
	'	Maximum number of previously edited files for which the marks
		are remembered.  This parameter must always be included when
		'viminfo' is non-empty.
		Including this item also means that the |jumplist| and the
		|changelist| are stored in the viminfo file.
							*viminfo-/*
	/	Maximum number of items in the search pattern history to be
		saved.  If non-zero, then the previous search and substitute
		patterns are also saved.  When not included, the value of
		'history' is used.
							*viminfo-:*
	:	Maximum number of items in the command-line history to be
		saved.  When not included, the value of 'history' is used.
							*viminfo-<*
	<	Maximum number of lines saved for each register.  If zero then
		registers are not saved.  When not included, all lines are
		saved.  '"' is the old name for this item.
		Also see the 's' item below: limit specified in Kbyte.
							*viminfo-@*
	@	Maximum number of items in the input-line history to be
		saved.  When not included, the value of 'history' is used.
							*viminfo-c*
	c	When included, convert the text in the viminfo file from the
		'encoding' used when writing the file to the current
		'encoding'.  See |viminfo-encoding|.
							*viminfo-f*
	f	Whether file marks need to be stored.  If zero, file marks ('0
		to '9, 'A to 'Z) are not stored.  When not present or when
		non-zero, they are all stored.  '0 is used for the current
		cursor position (when exiting or when doing ":wviminfo").
							*viminfo-h*
	h	Disable the effect of 'hlsearch' when loading the viminfo
		file.  When not included, it depends on whether ":nohlsearch"
		has been used since the last search command.
							*viminfo-n*
	n	Name of the viminfo file.  The name must immediately follow
		the 'n'.  Must be the last one!  If the "-i" argument was
		given when starting Vim, that file name overrides the one
		given here with 'viminfo'.  Environment variables are expanded
		when opening the file, not when setting the option.
							*viminfo-r*
	r	Removable media.  The argument is a string (up to the next
		',').  This parameter can be given several times.  Each
		specifies the start of a path for which no marks will be
		stored.  This is to avoid removable media.  For MS-DOS you
		could use "ra:,rb:", for Amiga "rdf0:,rdf1:,rdf2:".  You can
		also use it for temp files, e.g., for Unix: "r/tmp".  Case is
		ignored.  Maximum length of each 'r' argument is 50
		characters.
							*viminfo-s*
	s	Maximum size of an item in Kbyte.  If zero then registers are
		not saved.  Currently only applies to registers.  The default
		"s10" will exclude registers with more than 10 Kbyte of text.
		Also see the '<' item above: line count limit.

	Example: >
	    :set viminfo='50,<1000,s100,:0,n~/vim/viminfo
<
	'50		Marks will be remembered for the last 50 files you
			edited.
	<1000		Contents of registers (up to 1000 lines each) will be
			remembered.
	s100		Registers with more than 100 Kbyte text are skipped.
	:0		Command-line history will not be saved.
	n~/vim/viminfo	The name of the file to use is "~/vim/viminfo".
	no /		Since '/' is not specified, the default will be used,
			that is, save all of the search history, and also the
			previous search and substitute patterns.
	no %		The buffer list will not be saved nor read back.
	no h		'hlsearch' highlighting will be restored.

	When setting 'viminfo' from an empty value you can use |:rviminfo| to
	load the contents of the file, this is not done automatically.

	This option cannot be set from a |modeline| or in the |sandbox|, for
	security reasons.

					    *'virtualedit'* *'ve'*
'virtualedit' 've'	string	(default "")
			global
			{not in Vi}
			{not available when compiled without the
			|+virtualedit| feature}
	A comma separated list of these words:
	    block	Allow virtual editing in Visual block mode.
	    insert	Allow virtual editing in Insert mode.
	    all		Allow virtual editing in all modes.
	    onemore	Allow the cursor to move just past the end of the line

	Virtual editing means that the cursor can be positioned where there is
	no actual character.  This can be halfway into a tab or beyond the end
	of the line.  Useful for selecting a rectangle in Visual mode and
	editing a table.
	"onemore" is not the same, it will only allow moving the cursor just
	after the last character of the line.  This makes some commands more
	consistent.  Previously the cursor was always past the end of the line
	if the line was empty.  But it is far from Vi compatible.  It may also
	break some plugins or Vim scripts.  For example because |l| can move
	the cursor after the last character.  Use with care!
	Using the `$` command will move to the last character in the line, not
	past it.  This may actually move the cursor to the left!
	The `g$` command will move to the end of the screen line.
	It doesn't make sense to combine "all" with "onemore", but you will
	not get a warning for it.

			*'visualbell'* *'vb'* *'novisualbell'* *'novb'* *beep*
'visualbell' 'vb'	boolean	(default off)
			global
			{not in Vi}
	Use visual bell instead of beeping.  The terminal code to display the
	visual bell is given with 't_vb'.  When no beep or flash is wanted,
	use ":set vb t_vb=".
	Note: When the GUI starts, 't_vb' is reset to its default value.  You
	might want to set it again in your |gvimrc|.
	In the GUI, 't_vb' defaults to "<Esc>|f", which inverts the display
	for 20 msec.  If you want to use a different time, use "<Esc>|40f",
	where 40 is the time in msec.
	Does not work on the Amiga, you always get a screen flash.
	Also see 'errorbells'.

						*'warn'* *'nowarn'*
'warn'			boolean	(default on)
			global
	Give a warning message when a shell command is used while the buffer
	has been changed.

		     *'weirdinvert'* *'wiv'* *'noweirdinvert'* *'nowiv'*
'weirdinvert' 'wiv'	boolean	(default off)
			global
			{not in Vi}
	This option has the same effect as the 't_xs' terminal option.
	It is provided for backwards compatibility with version 4.x.
	Setting 'weirdinvert' has the effect of making 't_xs' non-empty, and
	vice versa.  Has no effect when the GUI is running.

						*'whichwrap'* *'ww'*
'whichwrap' 'ww'	string	(Vim default: "b,s", Vi default: "")
			global
			{not in Vi}
	Allow specified keys that move the cursor left/right to move to the
	previous/next line when the cursor is on the first/last character in
	the line.  Concatenate characters to allow this for these keys:
		char   key	  mode	~
		 b    <BS>	 Normal and Visual
		 s    <Space>	 Normal and Visual
		 h    "h"	 Normal and Visual (not recommended)
		 l    "l"	 Normal and Visual (not recommended)
		 <    <Left>	 Normal and Visual
		 >    <Right>	 Normal and Visual
		 ~    "~"	 Normal
		 [    <Left>	 Insert and Replace
		 ]    <Right>	 Insert and Replace
	For example: >
		:set ww=<,>,[,]
<	allows wrap only when cursor keys are used.
	When the movement keys are used in combination with a delete or change
	operator, the <EOL> also counts for a character.  This makes "3h"
	different from "3dh" when the cursor crosses the end of a line.  This
	is also true for "x" and "X", because they do the same as "dl" and
	"dh".  If you use this, you may also want to use the mapping
	":map <BS> X" to make backspace delete the character in front of the
	cursor.
	When 'l' is included and it is used after an operator at the end of a
	line then it will not move to the next line.  This makes "dl", "cl",
	"yl" etc. work normally.
	NOTE: This option is set to the Vi default value when 'compatible' is
	set and to the Vim default value when 'compatible' is reset.

						*'wildchar'* *'wc'*
'wildchar' 'wc'		number	(Vim default: <Tab>, Vi default: CTRL-E)
			global
			{not in Vi}
	Character you have to type to start wildcard expansion in the
	command-line, as specified with 'wildmode'.
	More info here: |cmdline-completion|.
	The character is not recognized when used inside a macro.  See
	'wildcharm' for that.
	Although 'wc' is a number option, you can set it to a special key: >
		:set wc=<Esc>
<	NOTE: This option is set to the Vi default value when 'compatible' is
	set and to the Vim default value when 'compatible' is reset.

						*'wildcharm'* *'wcm'*
'wildcharm' 'wcm'	number	(default: none (0))
			global
			{not in Vi}
	'wildcharm' works exactly like 'wildchar', except that it is
	recognized when used inside a macro.  You can find "spare" command-line
	keys suitable for this option by looking at |ex-edit-index|.  Normally
	you'll never actually type 'wildcharm', just use it in mappings that
	automatically invoke completion mode, e.g.: >
		:set wcm=<C-Z>
		:cnoremap ss so $vim/sessions/*.vim<C-Z>
<	Then after typing :ss you can use CTRL-P & CTRL-N.

						*'wildignore'* *'wig'*
'wildignore' 'wig'	string	(default "")
			global
			{not in Vi}
			{not available when compiled without the |+wildignore|
			feature}
	A list of file patterns.  A file that matches with one of these
	patterns is ignored when expanding |wildcards|, completing file or
	directory names, and influences the result of |expand()|, |glob()| and
	|globpath()| unless a flag is passed to disable this.
	The pattern is used like with |:autocmd|, see |autocmd-patterns|.
	Also see 'suffixes'.
	Example: >
		:set wildignore=*.o,*.obj
<	The use of |:set+=| and |:set-=| is preferred when adding or removing
	a pattern from the list.  This avoids problems when a future version
	uses another default.


			*'wildignorecase'* *'wic'* *'nowildignorecase'* *'nowic'*
'wildignorecase' 'wic'	boolean	(default off)
			global
			{not in Vi}
	When set case is ignored when completing file names and directories.
	Has no effect when 'fileignorecase' is set.
	Does not apply when the shell is used to expand wildcards, which
	happens when there are special characters.


				*'wildmenu'* *'wmnu'* *'nowildmenu'* *'nowmnu'*
'wildmenu' 'wmnu'	boolean	(default off)
			global
			{not in Vi}
			{not available if compiled without the |+wildmenu|
			feature}
	When 'wildmenu' is on, command-line completion operates in an enhanced
	mode.  On pressing 'wildchar' (usually <Tab>) to invoke completion,
	the possible matches are shown just above the command line, with the
	first match highlighted (overwriting the status line, if there is
	one).  Keys that show the previous/next match, such as <Tab> or
	CTRL-P/CTRL-N, cause the highlight to move to the appropriate match.
	When 'wildmode' is used, "wildmenu" mode is used where "full" is
	specified.  "longest" and "list" do not start "wildmenu" mode.
	You can check the current mode with |wildmenumode()|.
	If there are more matches than can fit in the line, a ">" is shown on
	the right and/or a "<" is shown on the left.  The status line scrolls
	as needed.
	The "wildmenu" mode is abandoned when a key is hit that is not used
	for selecting a completion.
	While the "wildmenu" is active the following keys have special
	meanings:

	<Left> <Right>	- select previous/next match (like CTRL-P/CTRL-N)
	<Down>		- in filename/menu name completion: move into a
			  subdirectory or submenu.
	<CR>		- in menu completion, when the cursor is just after a
			  dot: move into a submenu.
	<Up>		- in filename/menu name completion: move up into
			  parent directory or parent menu.

	This makes the menus accessible from the console |console-menus|.

	If you prefer the <Left> and <Right> keys to move the cursor instead
	of selecting a different match, use this: >
		:cnoremap <Left> <Space><BS><Left>
		:cnoremap <Right> <Space><BS><Right>
<
	The "WildMenu" highlighting is used for displaying the current match
	|hl-WildMenu|.

						*'wildmode'* *'wim'*
'wildmode' 'wim'	string	(Vim default: "full")
			global
			{not in Vi}
	Completion mode that is used for the character specified with
	'wildchar'.  It is a comma separated list of up to four parts.  Each
	part specifies what to do for each consecutive use of 'wildchar'.  The
	first part specifies the behavior for the first use of 'wildchar',
	The second part for the second use, etc.
	These are the possible values for each part:
	""		Complete only the first match.
	"full"		Complete the next full match.  After the last match,
			the original string is used and then the first match
			again.
	"longest"	Complete till longest common string.  If this doesn't
			result in a longer string, use the next part.
	"longest:full"	Like "longest", but also start 'wildmenu' if it is
			enabled.
	"list"		When more than one match, list all matches.
	"list:full"	When more than one match, list all matches and
			complete first match.
	"list:longest"	When more than one match, list all matches and
			complete till longest common string.
	When there is only a single match, it is fully completed in all cases.

	Examples: >
		:set wildmode=full
<	Complete first full match, next match, etc.  (the default) >
		:set wildmode=longest,full
<	Complete longest common string, then each full match >
		:set wildmode=list:full
<	List all matches and complete each full match >
		:set wildmode=list,full
<	List all matches without completing, then each full match >
		:set wildmode=longest,list
<	Complete longest common string, then list alternatives.
	More info here: |cmdline-completion|.

						*'wildoptions'* *'wop'*
'wildoptions' 'wop'	string	(default "")
			global
			{not in Vi}
			{not available when compiled without the |+wildignore|
			feature}
	A list of words that change how command line completion is done.
	Currently only one word is allowed:
	  tagfile	When using CTRL-D to list matching tags, the kind of
			tag and the file of the tag is listed.	Only one match
			is displayed per line.  Often used tag kinds are:
				d	#define
				f	function
	Also see |cmdline-completion|.

						*'winaltkeys'* *'wak'*
'winaltkeys' 'wak'	string	(default "menu")
			global
			{not in Vi}
			{only used in Win32, Motif, GTK and Photon GUI}
	Some GUI versions allow the access to menu entries by using the ALT
	key in combination with a character that appears underlined in the
	menu.  This conflicts with the use of the ALT key for mappings and
	entering special characters.  This option tells what to do:
	  no	Don't use ALT keys for menus.  ALT key combinations can be
		mapped, but there is no automatic handling.  This can then be
		done with the |:simalt| command.
	  yes	ALT key handling is done by the windowing system.  ALT key
		combinations cannot be mapped.
	  menu	Using ALT in combination with a character that is a menu
		shortcut key, will be handled by the windowing system.  Other
		keys can be mapped.
	If the menu is disabled by excluding 'm' from 'guioptions', the ALT
	key is never used for the menu.
	This option is not used for <F10>; on Win32 and with GTK <F10> will
	select the menu, unless it has been mapped.

						*'window'* *'wi'*
'window' 'wi'		number  (default screen height - 1)
			global
	Window height.  Do not confuse this with the height of the Vim window,
	use 'lines' for that.
	Used for |CTRL-F| and |CTRL-B| when there is only one window and the
	value is smaller than 'lines' minus one.  The screen will scroll
	'window' minus two lines, with a minimum of one.
	When 'window' is equal to 'lines' minus one CTRL-F and CTRL-B scroll
	in a much smarter way, taking care of wrapping lines.
	When resizing the Vim window, the value is smaller than 1 or more than
	or equal to 'lines' it will be set to 'lines' minus 1.
	{Vi also uses the option to specify the number of displayed lines}

						*'winheight'* *'wh'* *E591*
'winheight' 'wh'	number	(default 1)
			global
			{not in Vi}
			{not available when compiled without the |+windows|
			feature}
	Minimal number of lines for the current window.  This is not a hard
	minimum, Vim will use fewer lines if there is not enough room.  If the
	focus goes to a window that is smaller, its size is increased, at the
	cost of the height of other windows.
	Set 'winheight' to a small number for normal editing.
	Set it to 999 to make the current window fill most of the screen.
	Other windows will be only 'winminheight' high.  This has the drawback
	that ":all" will create only two windows.  To avoid "vim -o 1 2 3 4"
	to create only two windows, set the option after startup is done,
	using the |VimEnter| event: >
		au VimEnter * set winheight=999
<	Minimum value is 1.
	The height is not adjusted after one of the commands that change the
	height of the current window.
	'winheight' applies to the current window.  Use 'winminheight' to set
	the minimal height for other windows.

			*'winfixheight'* *'wfh'* *'nowinfixheight'* *'nowfh'*
'winfixheight' 'wfh'	boolean	(default off)
			local to window
			{not in Vi}
			{not available when compiled without the |+windows|
			feature}
	Keep the window height when windows are opened or closed and
	'equalalways' is set.  Also for |CTRL-W_=|.  Set by default for the
	|preview-window| and |quickfix-window|.
	The height may be changed anyway when running out of room.

			*'winfixwidth'* *'wfw'* *'nowinfixwidth'* *'nowfw'*
'winfixwidth' 'wfw'	boolean	(default off)
			local to window
			{not in Vi}
			{not available when compiled without the |+windows|
			feature}
	Keep the window width when windows are opened or closed and
	'equalalways' is set.  Also for |CTRL-W_=|.
	The width may be changed anyway when running out of room.

						*'winminheight'* *'wmh'*
'winminheight' 'wmh'	number	(default 1)
			global
			{not in Vi}
			{not available when compiled without the |+windows|
			feature}
	The minimal height of a window, when it's not the current window.
	This is a hard minimum, windows will never become smaller.
	When set to zero, windows may be "squashed" to zero lines (i.e. just a
	status bar) if necessary.  They will return to at least one line when
	they become active (since the cursor has to have somewhere to go.)
	Use 'winheight' to set the minimal height of the current window.
	This option is only checked when making a window smaller.  Don't use a
	large number, it will cause errors when opening more than a few
	windows.  A value of 0 to 3 is reasonable.

						*'winminwidth'* *'wmw'*
'winminwidth' 'wmw'	number	(default 1)
			global
			{not in Vi}
			{not available when compiled without the |+vertsplit|
			feature}
	The minimal width of a window, when it's not the current window.
	This is a hard minimum, windows will never become smaller.
	When set to zero, windows may be "squashed" to zero columns (i.e. just
	a vertical separator) if necessary.  They will return to at least one
	line when they become active (since the cursor has to have somewhere
	to go.)
	Use 'winwidth' to set the minimal width of the current window.
	This option is only checked when making a window smaller.  Don't use a
	large number, it will cause errors when opening more than a few
	windows.  A value of 0 to 12 is reasonable.

						*'winwidth'* *'wiw'* *E592*
'winwidth' 'wiw'	number	(default 20)
			global
			{not in Vi}
			{not available when compiled without the |+vertsplit|
			feature}
	Minimal number of columns for the current window.  This is not a hard
	minimum, Vim will use fewer columns if there is not enough room.  If
	the current window is smaller, its size is increased, at the cost of
	the width of other windows.  Set it to 999 to make the current window
	always fill the screen.  Set it to a small number for normal editing.
	The width is not adjusted after one of the commands to change the
	width of the current window.
	'winwidth' applies to the current window.  Use 'winminwidth' to set
	the minimal width for other windows.

						*'wrap'* *'nowrap'*
'wrap'			boolean	(default on)
			local to window
			{not in Vi}
	This option changes how text is displayed.  It doesn't change the text
	in the buffer, see 'textwidth' for that.
	When on, lines longer than the width of the window will wrap and
	displaying continues on the next line.  When off lines will not wrap
	and only part of long lines will be displayed.  When the cursor is
	moved to a part that is not shown, the screen will scroll
	horizontally.
	The line will be broken in the middle of a word if necessary.  See
	'linebreak' to get the break at a word boundary.
	To make scrolling horizontally a bit more useful, try this: >
		:set sidescroll=5
		:set listchars+=precedes:<,extends:>
<	See 'sidescroll', 'listchars' and |wrap-off|.
	This option can't be set from a |modeline| when the 'diff' option is
	on.

						*'wrapmargin'* *'wm'*
'wrapmargin' 'wm'	number	(default 0)
			local to buffer
	Number of characters from the right window border where wrapping
	starts.  When typing text beyond this limit, an <EOL> will be inserted
	and inserting continues on the next line.
	Options that add a margin, such as 'number' and 'foldcolumn', cause
	the text width to be further reduced.  This is Vi compatible.
	When 'textwidth' is non-zero, this option is not used.
	See also 'formatoptions' and |ins-textwidth|.  {Vi: works differently
	and less usefully}

				   *'wrapscan'* *'ws'* *'nowrapscan'* *'nows'*
'wrapscan' 'ws'		boolean	(default on)			*E384* *E385*
			global
	Searches wrap around the end of the file.  Also applies to |]s| and
	|[s|, searching for spelling mistakes.

						   *'write'* *'nowrite'*
'write'			boolean	(default on)
			global
			{not in Vi}
	Allows writing files.  When not set, writing a file is not allowed.
	Can be used for a view-only mode, where modifications to the text are
	still allowed.  Can be reset with the |-m| or |-M| command line
	argument.  Filtering text is still possible, even though this requires
	writing a temporary file.

				   *'writeany'* *'wa'* *'nowriteany'* *'nowa'*
'writeany' 'wa'		boolean	(default off)
			global
	Allows writing to any file with no need for "!" override.

			     *'writebackup'* *'wb'* *'nowritebackup'* *'nowb'*
'writebackup' 'wb'	boolean	(default on with |+writebackup| feature, off
					otherwise)
			global
			{not in Vi}
	Make a backup before overwriting a file.  The backup is removed after
	the file was successfully written, unless the 'backup' option is
	also on.
	WARNING: Switching this option off means that when Vim fails to write
	your buffer correctly and then, for whatever reason, Vim exits, you
	lose both the original file and what you were writing.  Only reset
	this option if your file system is almost full and it makes the write
	fail (and make sure not to exit Vim until the write was successful).
	See |backup-table| for another explanation.
	When the 'backupskip' pattern matches, a backup is not made anyway.
	NOTE: This option is set to the default value when 'compatible' is
	set.

						*'writedelay'* *'wd'*
'writedelay' 'wd'	number	(default 0)
			global
			{not in Vi}
	The number of microseconds to wait for each character sent to the
	screen.  When non-zero, characters are sent to the terminal one by
	one.  For MS-DOS pcterm this does not work.  For debugging purposes.

Expression evaluation			*expression* *expr* *E15* *eval*

Using expressions is introduced in chapter 41 of the user manual |usr_41.txt|.

Note: Expression evaluation can be disabled at compile time.  If this has been
done, the features in this document are not available.	See |+eval| and
|no-eval-feature|.

==============================================================================
1. Variables						*variables*

1.1 Variable types ~
							*E712*
There are six types of variables:

Number		A 32 or 64 bit signed number.  |expr-number| *Number*
		Examples:  -123  0x10  0177

Float		A floating point number. |floating-point-format| *Float*
		{only when compiled with the |+float| feature}
		Examples: 123.456  1.15e-6  -1.1e3

String		A NUL terminated string of 8-bit unsigned characters (bytes).
		|expr-string| Examples: "ab\txx\"--"  'x-z''a,c'

Funcref		A reference to a function |Funcref|.
		Example: function("strlen")

List		An ordered sequence of items |List|.
		Example: [1, 2, ['a', 'b']]

Dictionary	An associative, unordered array: Each entry has a key and a
		value. |Dictionary|
		Example: {'blue': "#0000ff", 'red': "#ff0000"}

The Number and String types are converted automatically, depending on how they
are used.

Conversion from a Number to a String is by making the ASCII representation of
the Number.  Examples:
	Number 123	-->	String "123" ~
	Number 0	-->	String "0" ~
	Number -1	-->	String "-1" ~
							*octal*
Conversion from a String to a Number is done by converting the first digits
to a number.  Hexadecimal "0xf9" and Octal "017" numbers are recognized.  If
the String doesn't start with digits, the result is zero.  Examples:
	String "456"	-->	Number 456 ~
	String "6bar"	-->	Number 6 ~
	String "foo"	-->	Number 0 ~
	String "0xf1"	-->	Number 241 ~
	String "0100"	-->	Number 64 ~
	String "-8"	-->	Number -8 ~
	String "+8"	-->	Number 0 ~

To force conversion from String to Number, add zero to it: >
	:echo "0100" + 0
<	64 ~

To avoid a leading zero to cause octal conversion, or for using a different
base, use |str2nr()|.

For boolean operators Numbers are used.  Zero is FALSE, non-zero is TRUE.

Note that in the command >
	:if "foo"
"foo" is converted to 0, which means FALSE.  To test for a non-empty string,
use empty(): >
	:if !empty("foo")
<				*E745* *E728* *E703* *E729* *E730* *E731*
List, Dictionary and Funcref types are not automatically converted.

							*E805* *E806* *E808*
When mixing Number and Float the Number is converted to Float.	Otherwise
there is no automatic conversion of Float.  You can use str2float() for String
to Float, printf() for Float to String and float2nr() for Float to Number.

						*E706* *sticky-type-checking*
You will get an error if you try to change the type of a variable.  You need
to |:unlet| it first to avoid this error.  String and Number are considered
equivalent though, as well are Float and Number.  Consider this sequence of
commands: >
	:let l = "string"
	:let l = 44		" changes type from String to Number
	:let l = [1, 2, 3]	" error!  l is still a Number
	:let l = 4.4		" changes type from Number to Float
	:let l = "string"	" error!


1.2 Function references ~
					*Funcref* *E695* *E718*
A Funcref variable is obtained with the |function()| function.	It can be used
in an expression in the place of a function name, before the parenthesis
around the arguments, to invoke the function it refers to.  Example: >

	:let Fn = function("MyFunc")
	:echo Fn()
<							*E704* *E705* *E707*
A Funcref variable must start with a capital, "s:", "w:", "t:" or "b:".  You
can use "g:" but the following name must still start with a capital.  You
cannot have both a Funcref variable and a function with the same name.

A special case is defining a function and directly assigning its Funcref to a
Dictionary entry.  Example: >
	:function dict.init() dict
	:   let self.val = 0
	:endfunction

The key of the Dictionary can start with a lower case letter.  The actual
function name is not used here.  Also see |numbered-function|.

A Funcref can also be used with the |:call| command: >
	:call Fn()
	:call dict.init()

The name of the referenced function can be obtained with |string()|. >
	:let func = string(Fn)

You can use |call()| to invoke a Funcref and use a list variable for the
arguments: >
	:let r = call(Fn, mylist)


1.3 Lists ~
						*list* *List* *Lists* *E686*
A List is an ordered sequence of items.  An item can be of any type.  Items
can be accessed by their index number.	Items can be added and removed at any
position in the sequence.


List creation ~
							*E696* *E697*
A List is created with a comma separated list of items in square brackets.
Examples: >
	:let mylist = [1, two, 3, "four"]
	:let emptylist = []

An item can be any expression.	Using a List for an item creates a
List of Lists: >
	:let nestlist = [[11, 12], [21, 22], [31, 32]]

An extra comma after the last item is ignored.


List index ~
							*list-index* *E684*
An item in the List can be accessed by putting the index in square brackets
after the List.  Indexes are zero-based, thus the first item has index zero. >
	:let item = mylist[0]		" get the first item: 1
	:let item = mylist[2]		" get the third item: 3

When the resulting item is a list this can be repeated: >
	:let item = nestlist[0][1]	" get the first list, second item: 12
<
A negative index is counted from the end.  Index -1 refers to the last item in
the List, -2 to the last but one item, etc. >
	:let last = mylist[-1]		" get the last item: "four"

To avoid an error for an invalid index use the |get()| function.  When an item
is not available it returns zero or the default value you specify: >
	:echo get(mylist, idx)
	:echo get(mylist, idx, "NONE")


List concatenation ~

Two lists can be concatenated with the "+" operator: >
	:let longlist = mylist + [5, 6]
	:let mylist += [7, 8]

To prepend or append an item turn the item into a list by putting [] around
it.  To change a list in-place see |list-modification| below.


Sublist ~

A part of the List can be obtained by specifying the first and last index,
separated by a colon in square brackets: >
	:let shortlist = mylist[2:-1]	" get List [3, "four"]

Omitting the first index is similar to zero.  Omitting the last index is
similar to -1. >
	:let endlist = mylist[2:]	" from item 2 to the end: [3, "four"]
	:let shortlist = mylist[2:2]	" List with one item: [3]
	:let otherlist = mylist[:]	" make a copy of the List

If the first index is beyond the last item of the List or the second item is
before the first item, the result is an empty list.  There is no error
message.

If the second index is equal to or greater than the length of the list the
length minus one is used: >
	:let mylist = [0, 1, 2, 3]
	:echo mylist[2:8]		" result: [2, 3]

NOTE: mylist[s:e] means using the variable "s:e" as index.  Watch out for
using a single letter variable before the ":".	Insert a space when needed:
mylist[s : e].


List identity ~
							*list-identity*
When variable "aa" is a list and you assign it to another variable "bb", both
variables refer to the same list.  Thus changing the list "aa" will also
change "bb": >
	:let aa = [1, 2, 3]
	:let bb = aa
	:call add(aa, 4)
	:echo bb
<	[1, 2, 3, 4]

Making a copy of a list is done with the |copy()| function.  Using [:] also
works, as explained above.  This creates a shallow copy of the list: Changing
a list item in the list will also change the item in the copied list: >
	:let aa = [[1, 'a'], 2, 3]
	:let bb = copy(aa)
	:call add(aa, 4)
	:let aa[0][1] = 'aaa'
	:echo aa
<	[[1, aaa], 2, 3, 4] >
	:echo bb
<	[[1, aaa], 2, 3]

To make a completely independent list use |deepcopy()|.  This also makes a
copy of the values in the list, recursively.  Up to a hundred levels deep.

The operator "is" can be used to check if two variables refer to the same
List.  "isnot" does the opposite.  In contrast "==" compares if two lists have
the same value. >
	:let alist = [1, 2, 3]
	:let blist = [1, 2, 3]
	:echo alist is blist
<	0 >
	:echo alist == blist
<	1

Note about comparing lists: Two lists are considered equal if they have the
same length and all items compare equal, as with using "==".  There is one
exception: When comparing a number with a string they are considered
different.  There is no automatic type conversion, as with using "==" on
variables.  Example: >
	echo 4 == "4"
<	1 >
	echo [4] == ["4"]
<	0

Thus comparing Lists is more strict than comparing numbers and strings.  You
can compare simple values this way too by putting them in a list: >

	:let a = 5
	:let b = "5"
	:echo a == b
<	1 >
	:echo [a] == [b]
<	0


List unpack ~

To unpack the items in a list to individual variables, put the variables in
square brackets, like list items: >
	:let [var1, var2] = mylist

When the number of variables does not match the number of items in the list
this produces an error.  To handle any extra items from the list append ";"
and a variable name: >
	:let [var1, var2; rest] = mylist

This works like: >
	:let var1 = mylist[0]
	:let var2 = mylist[1]
	:let rest = mylist[2:]

Except that there is no error if there are only two items.  "rest" will be an
empty list then.


List modification ~
							*list-modification*
To change a specific item of a list use |:let| this way: >
	:let list[4] = "four"
	:let listlist[0][3] = item

To change part of a list you can specify the first and last item to be
modified.  The value must at least have the number of items in the range: >
	:let list[3:5] = [3, 4, 5]

Adding and removing items from a list is done with functions.  Here are a few
examples: >
	:call insert(list, 'a')		" prepend item 'a'
	:call insert(list, 'a', 3)	" insert item 'a' before list[3]
	:call add(list, "new")		" append String item
	:call add(list, [1, 2])		" append a List as one new item
	:call extend(list, [1, 2])	" extend the list with two more items
	:let i = remove(list, 3)	" remove item 3
	:unlet list[3]			" idem
	:let l = remove(list, 3, -1)	" remove items 3 to last item
	:unlet list[3 : ]		" idem
	:call filter(list, 'v:val !~ "x"')  " remove items with an 'x'

Changing the order of items in a list: >
	:call sort(list)		" sort a list alphabetically
	:call reverse(list)		" reverse the order of items
	:call uniq(sort(list))		" sort and remove duplicates


For loop ~

The |:for| loop executes commands for each item in a list.  A variable is set
to each item in the list in sequence.  Example: >
	:for item in mylist
	:   call Doit(item)
	:endfor

This works like: >
	:let index = 0
	:while index < len(mylist)
	:   let item = mylist[index]
	:   :call Doit(item)
	:   let index = index + 1
	:endwhile

Note that all items in the list should be of the same type, otherwise this
results in error |E706|.  To avoid this |:unlet| the variable at the end of
the loop.

If all you want to do is modify each item in the list then the |map()|
function will be a simpler method than a for loop.

Just like the |:let| command, |:for| also accepts a list of variables.	This
requires the argument to be a list of lists. >
	:for [lnum, col] in [[1, 3], [2, 8], [3, 0]]
	:   call Doit(lnum, col)
	:endfor

This works like a |:let| command is done for each list item.  Again, the types
must remain the same to avoid an error.

It is also possible to put remaining items in a List variable: >
	:for [i, j; rest] in listlist
	:   call Doit(i, j)
	:   if !empty(rest)
	:      echo "remainder: " . string(rest)
	:   endif
	:endfor


List functions ~
						*E714*
Functions that are useful with a List: >
	:let r = call(funcname, list)	" call a function with an argument list
	:if empty(list)			" check if list is empty
	:let l = len(list)		" number of items in list
	:let big = max(list)		" maximum value in list
	:let small = min(list)		" minimum value in list
	:let xs = count(list, 'x')	" count nr of times 'x' appears in list
	:let i = index(list, 'x')	" index of first 'x' in list
	:let lines = getline(1, 10)	" get ten text lines from buffer
	:call append('$', lines)	" append text lines in buffer
	:let list = split("a b c")	" create list from items in a string
	:let string = join(list, ', ')	" create string from list items
	:let s = string(list)		" String representation of list
	:call map(list, '">> " . v:val')  " prepend ">> " to each item

Don't forget that a combination of features can make things simple.  For
example, to add up all the numbers in a list: >
	:exe 'let sum = ' . join(nrlist, '+')


1.4 Dictionaries ~
					*dict* *Dictionaries* *Dictionary*
A Dictionary is an associative array: Each entry has a key and a value.  The
entry can be located with the key.  The entries are stored without a specific
ordering.


Dictionary creation ~
						*E720* *E721* *E722* *E723*
A Dictionary is created with a comma separated list of entries in curly
braces.  Each entry has a key and a value, separated by a colon.  Each key can
only appear once.  Examples: >
	:let mydict = {1: 'one', 2: 'two', 3: 'three'}
	:let emptydict = {}
<							*E713* *E716* *E717*
A key is always a String.  You can use a Number, it will be converted to a
String automatically.  Thus the String '4' and the number 4 will find the same
entry.	Note that the String '04' and the Number 04 are different, since the
Number will be converted to the String '4'.

A value can be any expression.	Using a Dictionary for a value creates a
nested Dictionary: >
	:let nestdict = {1: {11: 'a', 12: 'b'}, 2: {21: 'c'}}

An extra comma after the last entry is ignored.


Accessing entries ~

The normal way to access an entry is by putting the key in square brackets: >
	:let val = mydict["one"]
	:let mydict["four"] = 4

You can add new entries to an existing Dictionary this way, unlike Lists.

For keys that consist entirely of letters, digits and underscore the following
form can be used |expr-entry|: >
	:let val = mydict.one
	:let mydict.four = 4

Since an entry can be any type, also a List and a Dictionary, the indexing and
key lookup can be repeated: >
	:echo dict.key[idx].key


Dictionary to List conversion ~

You may want to loop over the entries in a dictionary.	For this you need to
turn the Dictionary into a List and pass it to |:for|.

Most often you want to loop over the keys, using the |keys()| function: >
	:for key in keys(mydict)
	:   echo key . ': ' . mydict[key]
	:endfor

The List of keys is unsorted.  You may want to sort them first: >
	:for key in sort(keys(mydict))

To loop over the values use the |values()| function:  >
	:for v in values(mydict)
	:   echo "value: " . v
	:endfor

If you want both the key and the value use the |items()| function.  It returns
a List in which each item is a	List with two items, the key and the value: >
	:for [key, value] in items(mydict)
	:   echo key . ': ' . value
	:endfor


Dictionary identity ~
							*dict-identity*
Just like Lists you need to use |copy()| and |deepcopy()| to make a copy of a
Dictionary.  Otherwise, assignment results in referring to the same
Dictionary: >
	:let onedict = {'a': 1, 'b': 2}
	:let adict = onedict
	:let adict['a'] = 11
	:echo onedict['a']
	11

Two Dictionaries compare equal if all the key-value pairs compare equal.  For
more info see |list-identity|.


Dictionary modification ~
							*dict-modification*
To change an already existing entry of a Dictionary, or to add a new entry,
use |:let| this way: >
	:let dict[4] = "four"
	:let dict['one'] = item

Removing an entry from a Dictionary is done with |remove()| or |:unlet|.
Three ways to remove the entry with key "aaa" from dict: >
	:let i = remove(dict, 'aaa')
	:unlet dict.aaa
	:unlet dict['aaa']

Merging a Dictionary with another is done with |extend()|: >
	:call extend(adict, bdict)
This extends adict with all entries from bdict.  Duplicate keys cause entries
in adict to be overwritten.  An optional third argument can change this.
Note that the order of entries in a Dictionary is irrelevant, thus don't
expect ":echo adict" to show the items from bdict after the older entries in
adict.

Weeding out entries from a Dictionary can be done with |filter()|: >
	:call filter(dict, 'v:val =~ "x"')
This removes all entries from "dict" with a value not matching 'x'.


Dictionary function ~
				*Dictionary-function* *self* *E725* *E862*
When a function is defined with the "dict" attribute it can be used in a
special way with a dictionary.	Example: >
	:function Mylen() dict
	:   return len(self.data)
	:endfunction
	:let mydict = {'data': [0, 1, 2, 3], 'len': function("Mylen")}
	:echo mydict.len()

This is like a method in object oriented programming.  The entry in the
Dictionary is a |Funcref|.  The local variable "self" refers to the dictionary
the function was invoked from.

It is also possible to add a function without the "dict" attribute as a
Funcref to a Dictionary, but the "self" variable is not available then.

				*numbered-function* *anonymous-function*
To avoid the extra name for the function it can be defined and directly
assigned to a Dictionary in this way: >
	:let mydict = {'data': [0, 1, 2, 3]}
	:function mydict.len() dict
	:   return len(self.data)
	:endfunction
	:echo mydict.len()

The function will then get a number and the value of dict.len is a |Funcref|
that references this function.	The function can only be used through a
|Funcref|.  It will automatically be deleted when there is no |Funcref|
remaining that refers to it.

It is not necessary to use the "dict" attribute for a numbered function.

If you get an error for a numbered function, you can find out what it is with
a trick.  Assuming the function is 42, the command is: >
	:function {42}


Functions for Dictionaries ~
							*E715*
Functions that can be used with a Dictionary: >
	:if has_key(dict, 'foo')	" TRUE if dict has entry with key "foo"
	:if empty(dict)			" TRUE if dict is empty
	:let l = len(dict)		" number of items in dict
	:let big = max(dict)		" maximum value in dict
	:let small = min(dict)		" minimum value in dict
	:let xs = count(dict, 'x')	" count nr of times 'x' appears in dict
	:let s = string(dict)		" String representation of dict
	:call map(dict, '">> " . v:val')  " prepend ">> " to each item


1.5 More about variables ~
							*more-variables*
If you need to know the type of a variable or expression, use the |type()|
function.

When the '!' flag is included in the 'viminfo' option, global variables that
start with an uppercase letter, and don't contain a lowercase letter, are
stored in the viminfo file |viminfo-file|.

When the 'sessionoptions' option contains "global", global variables that
start with an uppercase letter and contain at least one lowercase letter are
stored in the session file |session-file|.

variable name		can be stored where ~
my_var_6		not
My_Var_6		session file
MY_VAR_6		viminfo file


It's possible to form a variable name with curly braces, see
|curly-braces-names|.

".." indicates that the operations in this level can be concatenated.
Example: >
	&nu || &list && &shell == "csh"

All expressions within one level are parsed from left to right.


expr1							*expr1* *E109*
-----

expr2 ? expr1 : expr1

The expression before the '?' is evaluated to a number.  If it evaluates to
non-zero, the result is the value of the expression between the '?' and ':',
otherwise the result is the value of the expression after the ':'.
Example: >
	:echo lnum == 1 ? "top" : lnum

Since the first expression is an "expr2", it cannot contain another ?:.  The
other two expressions can, thus allow for recursive use of ?:.
Example: >
	:echo lnum == 1 ? "top" : lnum == 1000 ? "last" : lnum

To keep this readable, using |line-continuation| is suggested: >
	:echo lnum == 1
	:\	? "top"
	:\	: lnum == 1000
	:\		? "last"
	:\		: lnum

You should always put a space before the ':', otherwise it can be mistaken for
use in a variable such as "a:1".


expr2 and expr3						*expr2* *expr3*
---------------

					*expr-barbar* *expr-&&*
The "||" and "&&" operators take one argument on each side.  The arguments
are (converted to) Numbers.  The result is:

	 input				 output ~
n1		n2		n1 || n2	n1 && n2 ~
zero		zero		zero		zero
zero		non-zero	non-zero	zero
non-zero	zero		non-zero	zero
non-zero	non-zero	non-zero	non-zero

The operators can be concatenated, for example: >

	&nu || &list && &shell == "csh"

Note that "&&" takes precedence over "||", so this has the meaning of: >

	&nu || (&list && &shell == "csh")

Once the result is known, the expression "short-circuits", that is, further
arguments are not evaluated.  This is like what happens in C.  For example: >

	let a = 1
	echo a || b

This is valid even if there is no variable called "b" because "a" is non-zero,
so the result must be non-zero.  Similarly below: >

	echo exists("b") && b == "yes"

This is valid whether "b" has been defined or not.  The second clause will
only be evaluated if "b" has been defined.


expr4							*expr4*
-----

expr5 {cmp} expr5

Compare two expr5 expressions, resulting in a 0 if it evaluates to false, or 1
if it evaluates to true.

							*E691* *E692*
A |List| can only be compared with a |List| and only "equal", "not equal" and
"is" can be used.  This compares the values of the list, recursively.
Ignoring case means case is ignored when comparing item values.

							*E735* *E736*
A |Dictionary| can only be compared with a |Dictionary| and only "equal", "not
equal" and "is" can be used.  This compares the key/values of the |Dictionary|
recursively.  Ignoring case means case is ignored when comparing item values.

							*E693* *E694*
A |Funcref| can only be compared with a |Funcref| and only "equal" and "not
equal" can be used.  Case is never ignored.

When using "is" or "isnot" with a |List| or a |Dictionary| this checks if the
expressions are referring to the same |List| or |Dictionary| instance.  A copy
of a |List| is different from the original |List|.  When using "is" without
a |List| or a |Dictionary| it is equivalent to using "equal", using "isnot"
equivalent to using "not equal".  Except that a different type means the
values are different: "4 == '4'" is true, "4 is '4'" is false and "0 is []" is
false and not an error. "is#"/"isnot#" and "is?"/"isnot?" can be used to match
and ignore case.

When comparing a String with a Number, the String is converted to a Number,
and the comparison is done on Numbers.	This means that "0 == 'x'" is TRUE,
because 'x' converted to a Number is zero.

When comparing two Strings, this is done with strcmp() or stricmp().  This
results in the mathematical difference (comparing byte values), not
necessarily the alphabetical difference in the local language.

When using the operators with a trailing '#', or the short version and
'ignorecase' is off, the comparing is done with strcmp(): case matters.

When using the operators with a trailing '?', or the short version and
'ignorecase' is set, the comparing is done with stricmp(): case is ignored.

'smartcase' is not used.

The "=~" and "!~" operators match the lefthand argument with the righthand
argument, which is used as a pattern.  See |pattern| for what a pattern is.
This matching is always done like 'magic' was set and 'cpoptions' is empty, no
matter what the actual value of 'magic' or 'cpoptions' is.  This makes scripts
portable.  To avoid backslashes in the regexp pattern to be doubled, use a
single-quote string, see |literal-string|.
Since a string is considered to be a single line, a multi-line pattern
(containing \n, backslash-n) will not match.  However, a literal NL character
can be matched like an ordinary character.  Examples:
	"foo\nbar" =~ "\n"	evaluates to 1
	"foo\nbar" =~ "\\n"	evaluates to 0


expr5 and expr6						*expr5* *expr6*
---------------
expr6 +	 expr6 ..	Number addition or |List| concatenation	*expr-+*
expr6 -	 expr6 ..	Number subtraction			*expr--*
expr6 .	 expr6 ..	String concatenation			*expr-.*

For |Lists| only "+" is possible and then both expr6 must be a list.  The
result is a new list with the two lists Concatenated.

expr7 *	 expr7 ..	Number multiplication			*expr-star*
expr7 /	 expr7 ..	Number division				*expr-/*
expr7 %	 expr7 ..	Number modulo				*expr-%*

For all, except ".", Strings are converted to Numbers.
For bitwise operators see |and()|, |or()| and |xor()|.

Note the difference between "+" and ".":
	"123" + "456" = 579
	"123" . "456" = "123456"

Since '.' has the same precedence as '+' and '-', you need to read: >
	1 . 90 + 90.0
As: >
	(1 . 90) + 90.0
That works, since the String "190" is automatically converted to the Number
190, which can be added to the Float 90.0.  However: >
	1 . 90 * 90.0
Should be read as: >
	1 . (90 * 90.0)
Since '.' has lower precedence than '*'.  This does NOT work, since this
attempts to concatenate a Float and a String.

When dividing a Number by zero the result depends on the value:
	  0 / 0  = -0x80000000	(like NaN for Float)
	 >0 / 0  =  0x7fffffff	(like positive infinity)
	 <0 / 0  = -0x7fffffff	(like negative infinity)
	(before Vim 7.2 it was always 0x7fffffff)

When the righthand side of '%' is zero, the result is 0.

None of these work for |Funcref|s.

. and % do not work for Float. *E804*


expr7							*expr7*
-----
! expr7			logical NOT		*expr-!*
- expr7			unary minus		*expr-unary--*
+ expr7			unary plus		*expr-unary-+*

For '!' non-zero becomes zero, zero becomes one.
For '-' the sign of the number is changed.
For '+' the number is unchanged.

A String will be converted to a Number first.

These three can be repeated and mixed.	Examples:
	!-1	    == 0
	!!8	    == 1
	--9	    == 9


expr8							*expr8*
-----
expr8[expr1]		item of String or |List|	*expr-[]* *E111*

If expr8 is a Number or String this results in a String that contains the
expr1'th single byte from expr8.  expr8 is used as a String, expr1 as a
Number.  This doesn't recognize multi-byte encodings, see |byteidx()| for
an alternative.

Index zero gives the first character.  This is like it works in C.  Careful:
text column numbers start with one!  Example, to get the character under the
cursor: >
	:let c = getline(".")[col(".") - 1]

If the length of the String is less than the index, the result is an empty
String.  A negative index always results in an empty string (reason: backwards
compatibility).  Use [-1:] to get the last byte.

If expr8 is a |List| then it results the item at index expr1.  See |list-index|
for possible index values.  If the index is out of range this results in an
error.	Example: >
	:let item = mylist[-1]		" get last item

Generally, if a |List| index is equal to or higher than the length of the
|List|, or more negative than the length of the |List|, this results in an
error.


expr8[expr1a : expr1b]	substring or sublist		*expr-[:]*

If expr8 is a Number or String this results in the substring with the bytes
from expr1a to and including expr1b.  expr8 is used as a String, expr1a and
expr1b are used as a Number.  This doesn't recognize multi-byte encodings, see
|byteidx()| for computing the indexes.

If expr1a is omitted zero is used.  If expr1b is omitted the length of the
string minus one is used.

A negative number can be used to measure from the end of the string.  -1 is
the last character, -2 the last but one, etc.

If an index goes out of range for the string characters are omitted.  If
expr1b is smaller than expr1a the result is an empty string.

Examples: >
	:let c = name[-1:]		" last byte of a string
	:let c = name[-2:-2]		" last but one byte of a string
	:let s = line(".")[4:]		" from the fifth byte to the end
	:let s = s[:-3]			" remove last two bytes
<
							*sublist* *slice*
If expr8 is a |List| this results in a new |List| with the items indicated by
the indexes expr1a and expr1b.	This works like with a String, as explained
just above, except that indexes out of range cause an error.  Examples: >
	:let l = mylist[:3]		" first four items
	:let l = mylist[4:4]		" List with one item
	:let l = mylist[:]		" shallow copy of a List

Using expr8[expr1] or expr8[expr1a : expr1b] on a |Funcref| results in an
error.


expr8.name		entry in a |Dictionary|		*expr-entry*

If expr8 is a |Dictionary| and it is followed by a dot, then the following
name will be used as a key in the |Dictionary|.  This is just like:
expr8[name].

The name must consist of alphanumeric characters, just like a variable name,
but it may start with a number.  Curly braces cannot be used.

There must not be white space before or after the dot.

Examples: >
	:let dict = {"one": 1, 2: "two"}
	:echo dict.one
	:echo dict .2

Note that the dot is also used for String concatenation.  To avoid confusion
always put spaces around the dot for String concatenation.


expr8(expr1, ...)	|Funcref| function call

When expr8 is a |Funcref| type variable, invoke the function it refers to.



							*expr9*
number
------
number			number constant			*expr-number* 
						*hex-number* *octal-number*

Decimal, Hexadecimal (starting with 0x or 0X), or Octal (starting with 0).

						*floating-point-format*
Floating point numbers can be written in two forms:

	[-+]{N}.{M}
	[-+]{N}.{M}e[-+]{exp}

{N} and {M} are numbers.  Both {N} and {M} must be present and can only
contain digits.
[-+] means there is an optional plus or minus sign.
{exp} is the exponent, power of 10.
Only a decimal point is accepted, not a comma.	No matter what the current
locale is.
{only when compiled with the |+float| feature}

Examples:
	123.456
	+0.0001
	55.0
	-0.123
	1.234e03
	1.0E-6
	-3.1416e+88

These are INVALID:
	3.		empty {M}
	1e40		missing .{M}

							*float-pi* *float-e*
A few useful values to copy&paste: >
	:let pi = 3.14159265359
	:let e  = 2.71828182846

Rationale:
Before floating point was introduced, the text "123.456" was interpreted as
the two numbers "123" and "456", both converted to a string and concatenated,
resulting in the string "123456".  Since this was considered pointless, and we
could not find it intentionally being used in Vim scripts, this backwards
incompatibility was accepted in favor of being able to use the normal notation
for floating point numbers.

						*floating-point-precision*
The precision and range of floating points numbers depends on what "double"
means in the library Vim was compiled with.  There is no way to change this at
runtime.

The default for displaying a |Float| is to use 6 decimal places, like using
printf("%g", f).  You can select something else when using the |printf()|
function.  Example: >
	:echo printf('%.15e', atan(1))
<	7.853981633974483e-01



string						*string* *expr-string* *E114*
------
"string"		string constant		*expr-quote*

Note that double quotes are used.

A string constant accepts these special characters:
\...	three-digit octal number (e.g., "\316")
\..	two-digit octal number (must be followed by non-digit)
\.	one-digit octal number (must be followed by non-digit)
\x..	byte specified with two hex numbers (e.g., "\x1f")
\x.	byte specified with one hex number (must be followed by non-hex char)
\X..	same as \x..
\X.	same as \x.
\u....	character specified with up to 4 hex numbers, stored according to the
	current value of 'encoding' (e.g., "\u02a4")
\U....	same as \u....
\b	backspace <BS>
\e	escape <Esc>
\f	formfeed <FF>
\n	newline <NL>
\r	return <CR>
\t	tab <Tab>
\\	backslash
\"	double quote
\<xxx>	Special key named "xxx".  e.g. "\<C-W>" for CTRL-W.  This is for use
	in mappings, the 0x80 byte is escaped.  Don't use <Char-xxxx> to get a
	utf-8 character, use \uxxxx as mentioned above.

Note that "\xff" is stored as the byte 255, which may be invalid in some
encodings.  Use "\u00ff" to store character 255 according to the current value
of 'encoding'.

Note that "\000" and "\x00" force the end of the string.


literal-string						*literal-string* *E115*
---------------
'string'		string constant			*expr-'*

Note that single quotes are used.

This string is taken as it is.	No backslashes are removed or have a special
meaning.  The only exception is that two quotes stand for one quote.

Single quoted strings are useful for patterns, so that backslashes do not need
to be doubled.	These two commands are equivalent: >
	if a =~ "\\s*"
	if a =~ '\s*'


option						*expr-option* *E112* *E113*
------
&option			option value, local value if possible
&g:option		global option value
&l:option		local option value

Examples: >
	echo "tabstop is " . &tabstop
	if &insertmode

Any option name can be used here.  See |options|.  When using the local value
and there is no buffer-local or window-local value, the global value is used
anyway.


register						*expr-register* *@r*
--------
@r			contents of register 'r'

The result is the contents of the named register, as a single string.
Newlines are inserted where required.  To get the contents of the unnamed
register use @" or @@.	See |registers| for an explanation of the available
registers.

When using the '=' register you get the expression itself, not what it
evaluates to.  Use |eval()| to evaluate it.


nesting							*expr-nesting* *E110*
-------
(expr1)			nested expression


environment variable					*expr-env*
--------------------
$VAR			environment variable

The String value of any environment variable.  When it is not defined, the
result is an empty string.
						*expr-env-expand*
Note that there is a difference between using $VAR directly and using
expand("$VAR").  Using it directly will only expand environment variables that
are known inside the current Vim session.  Using expand() will first try using
the environment variables known inside the current Vim session.  If that
fails, a shell will be used to expand the variable.  This can be slow, but it
does expand all variables that the shell knows about.  Example: >
	:echo $shell
	:echo expand("$shell")
The first one probably doesn't echo anything, the second echoes the $shell
variable (if your shell supports it).


internal variable					*expr-variable*
-----------------
variable		internal variable
See below |internal-variables|.


function call		*expr-function* *E116* *E118* *E119* *E120*
-------------
function(expr1, ...)	function call
See below |functions|.


==============================================================================
3. Internal variable				*internal-variables* *E461*

An internal variable name can be made up of letters, digits and '_'.  But it
cannot start with a digit.  It's also possible to use curly braces, see
|curly-braces-names|.

An internal variable is created with the ":let" command |:let|.
An internal variable is explicitly destroyed with the ":unlet" command
|:unlet|.
Using a name that is not an internal variable or refers to a variable that has
been destroyed results in an error.

There are several name spaces for variables.  Which one is to be used is
specified by what is prepended:

		(nothing) In a function: local to a function; otherwise: global
|buffer-variable|    b:	  Local to the current buffer.
|window-variable|    w:	  Local to the current window.
|tabpage-variable|   t:	  Local to the current tab page.
|global-variable|    g:	  Global.
|local-variable|     l:	  Local to a function.
|script-variable|    s:	  Local to a |:source|'ed Vim script.
|function-argument|  a:	  Function argument (only inside a function).
|vim-variable|       v:	  Global, predefined by Vim.

The scope name by itself can be used as a |Dictionary|.  For example, to
delete all script-local variables: >
	:for k in keys(s:)
	:    unlet s:[k]
	:endfor
<
						*buffer-variable* *b:var* *b:*
A variable name that is preceded with "b:" is local to the current buffer.
Thus you can have several "b:foo" variables, one for each buffer.
This kind of variable is deleted when the buffer is wiped out or deleted with
|:bdelete|.

One local buffer variable is predefined:
					*b:changedtick* *changetick*
b:changedtick	The total number of changes to the current buffer.  It is
		incremented for each change.  An undo command is also a change
		in this case.  This can be used to perform an action only when
		the buffer has changed.  Example: >
		    :if my_changedtick != b:changedtick
		    :	let my_changedtick = b:changedtick
		    :	call My_Update()
		    :endif
<
						*window-variable* *w:var* *w:*
A variable name that is preceded with "w:" is local to the current window.  It
is deleted when the window is closed.

						*tabpage-variable* *t:var* *t:*
A variable name that is preceded with "t:" is local to the current tab page,
It is deleted when the tab page is closed. {not available when compiled
without the |+windows| feature}

						*global-variable* *g:var* *g:*
Inside functions global variables are accessed with "g:".  Omitting this will
access a variable local to a function.	But "g:" can also be used in any other
place if you like.

						*local-variable* *l:var* *l:*
Inside functions local variables are accessed without prepending anything.
But you can also prepend "l:" if you like.  However, without prepending "l:"
you may run into reserved variable names.  For example "count".  By itself it
refers to "v:count".  Using "l:count" you can have a local variable with the
same name.

						*script-variable* *s:var*
In a Vim script variables starting with "s:" can be used.  They cannot be
accessed from outside of the scripts, thus are local to the script.

They can be used in:
- commands executed while the script is sourced
- functions defined in the script
- autocommands defined in the script
- functions and autocommands defined in functions and autocommands which were
  defined in the script (recursively)
- user defined commands defined in the script
Thus not in:
- other scripts sourced from this one
- mappings
- menus
- etc.

Script variables can be used to avoid conflicts with global variable names.
Take this example: >

	let s:counter = 0
	function MyCounter()
	  let s:counter = s:counter + 1
	  echo s:counter
	endfunction
	command Tick call MyCounter()

You can now invoke "Tick" from any script, and the "s:counter" variable in
that script will not be changed, only the "s:counter" in the script where
"Tick" was defined is used.

Another example that does the same: >

	let s:counter = 0
	command Tick let s:counter = s:counter + 1 | echo s:counter

When calling a function and invoking a user-defined command, the context for
script variables is set to the script where the function or command was
defined.

The script variables are also available when a function is defined inside a
function that is defined in a script.  Example: >

	let s:counter = 0
	function StartCounting(incr)
	  if a:incr
	    function MyCounter()
	      let s:counter = s:counter + 1
	    endfunction
	  else
	    function MyCounter()
	      let s:counter = s:counter - 1
	    endfunction
	  endif
	endfunction

This defines the MyCounter() function either for counting up or counting down
when calling StartCounting().  It doesn't matter from where StartCounting() is
called, the s:counter variable will be accessible in MyCounter().

When the same script is sourced again it will use the same script variables.
They will remain valid as long as Vim is running.  This can be used to
maintain a counter: >

	if !exists("s:counter")
	  let s:counter = 1
	  echo "script executed for the first time"
	else
	  let s:counter = s:counter + 1
	  echo "script executed " . s:counter . " times now"
	endif

Note that this means that filetype plugins don't get a different set of script
variables for each buffer.  Use local buffer variables instead |b:var|.


Predefined Vim variables:			*vim-variable* *v:var* *v:*

					*v:beval_col* *beval_col-variable*
v:beval_col	The number of the column, over which the mouse pointer is.
		This is the byte index in the |v:beval_lnum| line.
		Only valid while evaluating the 'balloonexpr' option.

					*v:beval_bufnr* *beval_bufnr-variable*
v:beval_bufnr	The number of the buffer, over which the mouse pointer is. Only
		valid while evaluating the 'balloonexpr' option.

					*v:beval_lnum* *beval_lnum-variable*
v:beval_lnum	The number of the line, over which the mouse pointer is. Only
		valid while evaluating the 'balloonexpr' option.

					*v:beval_text* *beval_text-variable*
v:beval_text	The text under or after the mouse pointer.  Usually a word as
		it is useful for debugging a C program.  'iskeyword' applies,
		but a dot and "->" before the position is included.  When on a
		']' the text before it is used, including the matching '[' and
		word before it.  When on a Visual area within one line the
		highlighted text is used.
		Only valid while evaluating the 'balloonexpr' option.

					*v:beval_winnr* *beval_winnr-variable*
v:beval_winnr	The number of the window, over which the mouse pointer is. Only
		valid while evaluating the 'balloonexpr' option.  The first
		window has number zero (unlike most other places where a
		window gets a number).

					*v:char* *char-variable*
v:char		Argument for evaluating 'formatexpr' and used for the typed
		character when using <expr> in an abbreviation |:map-<expr>|.
		It is also used by the |InsertCharPre| and |InsertEnter| events.

			*v:charconvert_from* *charconvert_from-variable*
v:charconvert_from
		The name of the character encoding of a file to be converted.
		Only valid while evaluating the 'charconvert' option.

			*v:charconvert_to* *charconvert_to-variable*
v:charconvert_to
		The name of the character encoding of a file after conversion.
		Only valid while evaluating the 'charconvert' option.

					*v:cmdarg* *cmdarg-variable*
v:cmdarg	This variable is used for two purposes:
		1. The extra arguments given to a file read/write command.
		   Currently these are "++enc=" and "++ff=".  This variable is
		   set before an autocommand event for a file read/write
		   command is triggered.  There is a leading space to make it
		   possible to append this variable directly after the
		   read/write command.	Note: The "+cmd" argument isn't
		   included here, because it will be executed anyway.
		2. When printing a PostScript file with ":hardcopy" this is
		   the argument for the ":hardcopy" command.  This can be used
		   in 'printexpr'.

					*v:cmdbang* *cmdbang-variable*
v:cmdbang	Set like v:cmdarg for a file read/write command.  When a "!"
		was used the value is 1, otherwise it is 0.  Note that this
		can only be used in autocommands.  For user commands |<bang>|
		can be used.

					*v:count* *count-variable*
v:count		The count given for the last Normal mode command.  Can be used
		to get the count before a mapping.  Read-only.	Example: >
	:map _x :<C-U>echo "the count is " . v:count<CR>
<		Note: The <C-U> is required to remove the line range that you
		get when typing ':' after a count.
		When there are two counts, as in "3d2w", they are multiplied,
		just like what happens in the command, "d6w" for the example.
		Also used for evaluating the 'formatexpr' option.
		"count" also works, for backwards compatibility.

					*v:count1* *count1-variable*
v:count1	Just like "v:count", but defaults to one when no count is
		used.

						*v:ctype* *ctype-variable*
v:ctype		The current locale setting for characters of the runtime
		environment.  This allows Vim scripts to be aware of the
		current locale encoding.  Technical: it's the value of
		LC_CTYPE.  When not using a locale the value is "C".
		This variable can not be set directly, use the |:language|
		command.
		See |multi-lang|.

					*v:dying* *dying-variable*
v:dying		Normally zero.	When a deadly signal is caught it's set to
		one.  When multiple signals are caught the number increases.
		Can be used in an autocommand to check if Vim didn't
		terminate normally. {only works on Unix}
		Example: >
	:au VimLeave * if v:dying | echo "\nAAAAaaaarrrggghhhh!!!\n" | endif
<		Note: if another deadly signal is caught when v:dying is one,
		VimLeave autocommands will not be executed.

					*v:errmsg* *errmsg-variable*
v:errmsg	Last given error message.  It's allowed to set this variable.
		Example: >
	:let v:errmsg = ""
	:silent! next
	:if v:errmsg != ""
	:  ... handle error
<		"errmsg" also works, for backwards compatibility.

					*v:exception* *exception-variable*
v:exception	The value of the exception most recently caught and not
		finished.  See also |v:throwpoint| and |throw-variables|.
		Example: >
	:try
	:  throw "oops"
	:catch /.*/
	:  echo "caught" v:exception
	:endtry
<		Output: "caught oops".

					*v:fcs_reason* *fcs_reason-variable*
v:fcs_reason	The reason why the |FileChangedShell| event was triggered.
		Can be used in an autocommand to decide what to do and/or what
		to set v:fcs_choice to.  Possible values:
			deleted		file no longer exists
			conflict	file contents, mode or timestamp was
					changed and buffer is modified
			changed		file contents has changed
			mode		mode of file changed
			time		only file timestamp changed

					*v:fcs_choice* *fcs_choice-variable*
v:fcs_choice	What should happen after a |FileChangedShell| event was
		triggered.  Can be used in an autocommand to tell Vim what to
		do with the affected buffer:
			reload		Reload the buffer (does not work if
					the file was deleted).
			ask		Ask the user what to do, as if there
					was no autocommand.  Except that when
					only the timestamp changed nothing
					will happen.
			<empty>		Nothing, the autocommand should do
					everything that needs to be done.
		The default is empty.  If another (invalid) value is used then
		Vim behaves like it is empty, there is no warning message.

					*v:fname_in* *fname_in-variable*
v:fname_in	The name of the input file.  Valid while evaluating:
			option		used for ~
			'charconvert'	file to be converted
			'diffexpr'	original file
			'patchexpr'	original file
			'printexpr'	file to be printed
		And set to the swap file name for |SwapExists|.

					*v:fname_out* *fname_out-variable*
v:fname_out	The name of the output file.  Only valid while
		evaluating:
			option		used for ~
			'charconvert'	resulting converted file (*)
			'diffexpr'	output of diff
			'patchexpr'	resulting patched file
		(*) When doing conversion for a write command (e.g., ":w
		file") it will be equal to v:fname_in.	When doing conversion
		for a read command (e.g., ":e file") it will be a temporary
		file and different from v:fname_in.

					*v:fname_new* *fname_new-variable*
v:fname_new	The name of the new version of the file.  Only valid while
		evaluating 'diffexpr'.

					*v:fname_diff* *fname_diff-variable*
v:fname_diff	The name of the diff (patch) file.  Only valid while
		evaluating 'patchexpr'.

					*v:folddashes* *folddashes-variable*
v:folddashes	Used for 'foldtext': dashes representing foldlevel of a closed
		fold.
		Read-only in the |sandbox|. |fold-foldtext|

					*v:foldlevel* *foldlevel-variable*
v:foldlevel	Used for 'foldtext': foldlevel of closed fold.
		Read-only in the |sandbox|. |fold-foldtext|

		Read-only in the |sandbox|. |fold-foldtext|

					*v:hlsearch* *hlsearch-variable*
v:hlsearch	Variable that determines whether search highlighting is on. 
		Makes sense only if 'hlsearch' is enabled which requires

		|:nohlsearch| command, setting it to one acts like >
			let &hlsearch = &hlsearch
<
					*v:insertmode* *insertmode-variable*
v:insertmode	Used for the |InsertEnter| and |InsertChange| autocommand
		events.  Values:
			i	Insert mode
			r	Replace mode
			v	Virtual Replace mode

						*v:key* *key-variable*
v:key		Key of the current item of a |Dictionary|.  Only valid while
		evaluating the expression used with |map()| and |filter()|.
		Read-only.

						*v:lang* *lang-variable*
v:lang		The current locale setting for messages of the runtime
		environment.  This allows Vim scripts to be aware of the
		current language.  Technical: it's the value of LC_MESSAGES.
		The value is system dependent.
		This variable can not be set directly, use the |:language|
		command.
		It can be different from |v:ctype| when messages are desired
		in a different language than what is used for character
		encoding.  See |multi-lang|.

						*v:lc_time* *lc_time-variable*
v:lc_time	The current locale setting for time messages of the runtime
		environment.  This allows Vim scripts to be aware of the
		current language.  Technical: it's the value of LC_TIME.
		This variable can not be set directly, use the |:language|
		command.  See |multi-lang|.

						*v:lnum* *lnum-variable*
v:lnum		Line number for the 'foldexpr' |fold-expr|, 'formatexpr' and
		'indentexpr' expressions, tab page number for 'guitablabel'
		and 'guitabtooltip'.  Only valid while one of these
		expressions is being evaluated.  Read-only when in the
		|sandbox|.

					*v:mouse_win* *mouse_win-variable*
v:mouse_win	Window number for a mouse click obtained with |getchar()|.
		First window has number 1, like with |winnr()|.  The value is
		zero when there was no mouse button click.

					*v:mouse_lnum* *mouse_lnum-variable*
v:mouse_lnum	Line number for a mouse click obtained with |getchar()|.
		This is the text line number, not the screen line number.  The
		value is zero when there was no mouse button click.

					*v:mouse_col* *mouse_col-variable*
v:mouse_col	Column number for a mouse click obtained with |getchar()|.
		This is the screen column number, like with |virtcol()|.  The
		value is zero when there was no mouse button click.

					*v:oldfiles* *oldfiles-variable*
v:oldfiles	List of file names that is loaded from the |viminfo| file on
		startup.  These are the files that Vim remembers marks for.
		The length of the List is limited by the ' argument of the
		'viminfo' option (default is 100).
		When the |viminfo| file is not used the List is empty.
		Also see |:oldfiles| and |c_#<|.
		The List can be modified, but this has no effect on what is
		stored in the |viminfo| file later.  If you use values other
		than String this will cause trouble.
		{only when compiled with the |+viminfo| feature}

					*v:operator* *operator-variable*
v:operator	The last operator given in Normal mode.  This is a single
		character except for commands starting with <g> or <z>,
		in which case it is two characters.  Best used alongside
		|v:prevcount| and |v:register|.  Useful if you want to cancel
		Operator-pending mode and then use the operator, e.g.: >
			:omap O <Esc>:call MyMotion(v:operator)<CR>
<		The value remains set until another operator is entered, thus
		don't expect it to be empty.
		v:operator is not set for |:delete|, |:yank| or other Ex
		commands.
		Read-only.

					*v:prevcount* *prevcount-variable*
v:prevcount	The count given for the last but one Normal mode command.
		This is the v:count value of the previous command.  Useful if
		you want to cancel Visual or Operator-pending mode and then
		use the count, e.g.: >
			:vmap % <Esc>:call MyFilter(v:prevcount)<CR>
<		Read-only.

					*v:profiling* *profiling-variable*
v:profiling	Normally zero.	Set to one after using ":profile start".
		See |profiling|.

					*v:progname* *progname-variable*
v:progname	Contains the name (with path removed) with which Vim was
		invoked.  Allows you to do special initialisations for |view|,
		|evim| etc., or any other name you might symlink to Vim.
		Read-only.

					*v:progpath* *progpath-variable*
v:progpath	Contains the command with which Vim was invoked, including the
		path.  Useful if you want to message a Vim server using a
		|--remote-expr|.
		To get the full path use: >
			echo exepath(v:progpath)
<		NOTE: This does not work when the command is a relative path
		and the current directory has changed.
		Read-only.

					*v:register* *register-variable*
v:register	The name of the register in effect for the current normal mode
		command (regardless of whether that command actually used a
		register).  Or for the currently executing normal mode mapping
		(use this in custom commands that take a register).
		If none is supplied it is the default register '"', unless
		'clipboard' contains "unnamed" or "unnamedplus", then it is
		'*' or '+'.
		Also see |getreg()| and |setreg()|

					*v:scrollstart* *scrollstart-variable*
v:scrollstart	String describing the script or function that caused the
		screen to scroll up.  It's only set when it is empty, thus the
		first reason is remembered.  It is set to "Unknown" for a
		typed command.
		This can be used to find out why your script causes the
		hit-enter prompt.

					*v:servername* *servername-variable*
v:servername	The resulting registered |x11-clientserver| name if any.
		Read-only.

		
v:searchforward			*v:searchforward* *searchforward-variable*
		Search direction:  1 after a forward search, 0 after a
		backward search.  It is reset to forward when directly setting
		the last search pattern, see |quote/|.
		Note that the value is restored when returning from a
		function. |function-search-undo|.
		Read-write.

					*v:shell_error* *shell_error-variable*
v:shell_error	Result of the last shell command.  When non-zero, the last
		shell command had an error.  When zero, there was no problem.
		This only works when the shell returns the error code to Vim.
		The value -1 is often used when the command could not be
		executed.  Read-only.
		Example: >
	:!mv foo bar
	:if v:shell_error
	:  echo 'could not rename "foo" to "bar"!'
	:endif
<		"shell_error" also works, for backwards compatibility.

					*v:statusmsg* *statusmsg-variable*
v:statusmsg	Last given status message.  It's allowed to set this variable.

					*v:swapname* *swapname-variable*
v:swapname	Only valid when executing |SwapExists| autocommands: Name of
		the swap file found.  Read-only.

					*v:swapchoice* *swapchoice-variable*
v:swapchoice	|SwapExists| autocommands can set this to the selected choice
		for handling an existing swap file:
			'o'	Open read-only
			'e'	Edit anyway
			'r'	Recover
			'd'	Delete swapfile
			'q'	Quit
			'a'	Abort
		The value should be a single-character string.	An empty value
		results in the user being asked, as would happen when there is
		no SwapExists autocommand.  The default is empty.

					*v:swapcommand* *swapcommand-variable*
v:swapcommand	Normal mode command to be executed after a file has been
		opened.  Can be used for a |SwapExists| autocommand to have
		another Vim open the file and jump to the right place.	For
		example, when jumping to a tag the value is ":tag tagname\r".
		For ":edit +cmd file" the value is ":cmd\r".

				*v:termresponse* *termresponse-variable*
v:termresponse	The escape sequence returned by the terminal for the |t_RV|
		termcap entry.	It is set when Vim receives an escape sequence
		that starts with ESC [ or CSI and ends in a 'c', with only
		digits, ';' and '.' in between.
		When this option is set, the TermResponse autocommand event is
		fired, so that you can react to the response from the
		terminal.
		The response from a new xterm is: "<Esc>[ Pp ; Pv ; Pc c".  Pp
		is the terminal type: 0 for vt100 and 1 for vt220.  Pv is the
		patch level (since this was introduced in patch 95, it's
		always 95 or bigger).  Pc is always zero.
		{only when compiled with |+termresponse| feature}

				*v:this_session* *this_session-variable*
v:this_session	Full filename of the last loaded or saved session file.  See
		|:mksession|.  It is allowed to set this variable.  When no
		session file has been saved, this variable is empty.
		"this_session" also works, for backwards compatibility.

					*v:throwpoint* *throwpoint-variable*
v:throwpoint	The point where the exception most recently caught and not
		finished was thrown.  Not set when commands are typed.	See
		also |v:exception| and |throw-variables|.
		Example: >
	:try
	:  throw "oops"
	:catch /.*/
	:  echo "Exception from" v:throwpoint
	:endtry
<		Output: "Exception from test.vim, line 2"

						*v:val* *val-variable*
v:val		Value of the current item of a |List| or |Dictionary|.	Only
		valid while evaluating the expression used with |map()| and
		|filter()|.  Read-only.

					*v:version* *version-variable*
v:version	Version number of Vim: Major version number times 100 plus
		minor version number.  Version 5.0 is 500.  Version 5.1 (5.01)
		is 501.  Read-only.  "version" also works, for backwards
		compatibility.
		Use |has()| to check if a certain patch was included, e.g.: >
			if has("patch-7.4.123")
<		Note that patch numbers are specific to the version, thus both
		version 5.0 and 5.1 may have a patch 123, but these are
		completely different.

					*v:warningmsg* *warningmsg-variable*
v:warningmsg	Last given warning message.  It's allowed to set this variable.

					*v:windowid* *windowid-variable*
v:windowid	When any X11 based GUI is running or when running in a
		terminal and Vim connects to the X server (|-X|) this will be
		set to the window ID.
		When an MS-Windows GUI is running this will be set to the
		window handle.
		Otherwise the value is zero.
		Note: for windows inside Vim use |winnr()|.

		{only available when compiled with the |+float| feature}


acos({expr})							*acos()*
		Return the arc cosine of {expr} measured in radians, as a
		|Float| in the range of [0, pi].
		{expr} must evaluate to a |Float| or a |Number| in the range
		[-1, 1].
		Examples: >

<			2.094395
		{only available when compiled with the |+float| feature}


add({list}, {expr})					*add()*
		Append the item {expr} to |List| {list}.  Returns the
		resulting |List|.  Examples: >
			:let alist = add([1, 2, 3], item)
			:call add(mylist, "woodstock")
<		Note that when {expr} is a |List| it is appended as a single
		item.  Use |extend()| to concatenate |Lists|.
		Use |insert()| to add an item at another position.


and({expr}, {expr})					*and()*
		Bitwise AND on the two arguments.  The arguments are converted
		to a number.  A List, Dict or Float argument causes an error.
		Example: >
			:let flag = and(bits, 0x80)


append({lnum}, {expr})					*append()*
		When {expr} is a |List|: Append each item of the |List| as a
		text line below line {lnum} in the current buffer.
		Otherwise append {expr} as one text line below line {lnum} in
		the current buffer.
		{lnum} can be zero to insert a line before the first one.
		Returns 1 for failure ({lnum} out of range or out of memory),
		0 for success.	Example: >
			:let failed = append(line('$'), "# THE END")
			:let failed = append(0, ["Chapter 1", "the beginning"])
<
							*argc()*
argc()		The result is the number of files in the argument list of the
		current window.  See |arglist|.

							*argidx()*
argidx()	The result is the current index in the argument list.  0 is
		the first file.  argc() - 1 is the last one.  See |arglist|.

							*arglistid()*
arglistid([{winnr}, [ {tabnr} ]])
		Return the argument list ID.  This is a number which
		identifies the argument list being used.  Zero is used for the
		global argument list.  See |arglist|.
		Return -1 if the arguments are invalid.

		Without arguments use the current window.
		With {winnr} only use this window in the current tab page.
		With {winnr} and {tabnr} use the window in the specified tab
		page.

							*argv()*
argv([{nr}])	The result is the {nr}th file in the argument list of the
		current window.  See |arglist|.  "argv(0)" is the first one.
		Example: >
	:let i = 0
	:while i < argc()
	:  let f = escape(fnameescape(argv(i)), '.')
	:  exe 'amenu Arg.' . f . ' :e ' . f . '<CR>'
	:  let i = i + 1
	:endwhile
<		Without the {nr} argument a |List| with the whole |arglist| is
		returned.

asin({expr})						*asin()*
		Return the arc sine of {expr} measured in radians, as a |Float|
		in the range of [-pi/2, pi/2].
		{expr} must evaluate to a |Float| or a |Number| in the range
		[-1, 1].
		Examples: >
			:echo asin(0.8)
<			0.927295 >
			:echo asin(-0.5)

			:echo atan(-4.01)
<			-1.326405
		{only available when compiled with the |+float| feature}


atan2({expr1}, {expr2})					*atan2()*
		Return the arc tangent of {expr1} / {expr2}, measured in
		radians, as a |Float| in the range [-pi, pi].
		{expr1} and {expr2} must evaluate to a |Float| or a |Number|.
		Examples: >
			:echo atan2(-1, 1)
<			-0.785398 >
			:echo atan2(1, -1)
<			2.356194
		{only available when compiled with the |+float| feature}


							*browse()*
browse({save}, {title}, {initdir}, {default})
		Put up a file requester.  This only works when "has("browse")"
		returns non-zero (only in some GUI versions).
		The input fields are:
		    {save}	when non-zero, select file to write
		    {title}	title for the requester
		    {initdir}	directory to start browsing in
		    {default}	default file name
		When the "Cancel" button is hit, something went wrong, or
		browsing is not possible, an empty string is returned.

							*browsedir()*
browsedir({title}, {initdir})
		Put up a directory requester.  This only works when
		"has("browse")" returns non-zero (only in some GUI versions).
		On systems where a directory browser is not supported a file
		browser is used.  In that case: select a file in the directory
		to be used.
		The input fields are:
		    {title}	title for the requester
		    {initdir}	directory to start browsing in
		When the "Cancel" button is hit, something went wrong, or
		browsing is not possible, an empty string is returned.

bufexists({expr})					*bufexists()*
		The result is a Number, which is non-zero if a buffer called
		{expr} exists.
		If the {expr} argument is a number, buffer numbers are used.
		If the {expr} argument is a string it must match a buffer name
		exactly.  The name can be:
		- Relative to the current directory.
		- A full path.
		- The name of a buffer with 'buftype' set to "nofile".
		- A URL name.
		Unlisted buffers will be found.
		Note that help files are listed by their short name in the
		output of |:buffers|, but bufexists() requires using their
		long name to be able to find them.
		bufexists() may report a buffer exists, but to use the name
		with a |:buffer| command you may need to use |expand()|.  Esp
		for MS-Windows 8.3 names in the form "c:\DOCUME~1"
		Use "bufexists(0)" to test for the existence of an alternate
		file name.
							*buffer_exists()*
		Obsolete name: buffer_exists().

buflisted({expr})					*buflisted()*
		The result is a Number, which is non-zero if a buffer called
		{expr} exists and is listed (has the 'buflisted' option set).
		The {expr} argument is used like with |bufexists()|.

bufloaded({expr})					*bufloaded()*
		The result is a Number, which is non-zero if a buffer called
		{expr} exists and is loaded (shown in a window or hidden).
		The {expr} argument is used like with |bufexists()|.

bufname({expr})						*bufname()*
		The result is the name of a buffer, as it is displayed by the
		":ls" command.
		If {expr} is a Number, that buffer number's name is given.
		Number zero is the alternate buffer for the current window.
		If {expr} is a String, it is used as a |file-pattern| to match
		with the buffer names.	This is always done like 'magic' is
		set and 'cpoptions' is empty.  When there is more than one
		match an empty string is returned.
		"" or "%" can be used for the current buffer, "#" for the
		alternate buffer.
		A full match is preferred, otherwise a match at the start, end
		or middle of the buffer name is accepted.  If you only want a
		full match then put "^" at the start and "$" at the end of the
		pattern.
		Listed buffers are found first.  If there is a single match
		with a listed buffer, that one is returned.  Next unlisted
		buffers are searched for.
		If the {expr} is a String, but you want to use it as a buffer
		number, force it to be a Number by adding zero to it: >
			:echo bufname("3" + 0)
<		If the buffer doesn't exist, or doesn't have a name, an empty
		string is returned. >
	bufname("#")		alternate buffer name
	bufname(3)		name of buffer 3
	bufname("%")		name of current buffer
	bufname("file2")	name of buffer where "file2" matches.
<							*buffer_name()*
		Obsolete name: buffer_name().

							*bufnr()*
bufnr({expr} [, {create}])
		The result is the number of a buffer, as it is displayed by
		the ":ls" command.  For the use of {expr}, see |bufname()|
		above.
		If the buffer doesn't exist, -1 is returned.  Or, if the
		{create} argument is present and not zero, a new, unlisted,
		buffer is created and its number is returned.
		bufnr("$") is the last buffer: >
	:let last_buffer = bufnr("$")
<		The result is a Number, which is the highest buffer number
		of existing buffers.  Note that not all buffers with a smaller
		number necessarily exist, because ":bwipeout" may have removed
		them.  Use bufexists() to test for the existence of a buffer.
							*buffer_number()*
		Obsolete name: buffer_number().
							*last_buffer_nr()*
		Obsolete name for bufnr("$"): last_buffer_nr().

bufwinnr({expr})					*bufwinnr()*
		The result is a Number, which is the number of the first
		window associated with buffer {expr}.  For the use of {expr},
		see |bufname()| above.	If buffer {expr} doesn't exist or
		there is no such window, -1 is returned.  Example: >

	echo "A window containing buffer 1 is " . (bufwinnr(1))

<		The number can be used with |CTRL-W_w| and ":wincmd w"
		|:wincmd|.
		Only deals with the current tab page.


byte2line({byte})					*byte2line()*
		Return the line number that contains the character at byte
		count {byte} in the current buffer.  This includes the
		end-of-line character, depending on the 'fileformat' option
		for the current buffer.  The first character has byte count
		one.
		Also see |line2byte()|, |go| and |:goto|.
		{not available when compiled without the |+byte_offset|
		feature}

byteidx({expr}, {nr})					*byteidx()*
		Return byte index of the {nr}'th character in the string
		{expr}.  Use zero for the first character, it returns zero.
		This function is only useful when there are multibyte
		characters, otherwise the returned value is equal to {nr}.
		Composing characters are not counted separately, their byte
		length is added to the preceding base character.  See
		|byteidxcomp()| below for counting composing characters
		separately.
		Example : >
			echo matchstr(str, ".", byteidx(str, 3))
<		will display the fourth character.  Another way to do the
		same: >
			let s = strpart(str, byteidx(str, 3))
			echo strpart(s, 0, byteidx(s, 1))
<		If there are less than {nr} characters -1 is returned.
		If there are exactly {nr} characters the length of the string
		in bytes is returned.

byteidxcomp({expr}, {nr})					*byteidxcomp()*
		Like byteidx(), except that a composing character is counted
		as a separate character.  Example: >
			let s = 'e' . nr2char(0x301)
			echo byteidx(s, 1)
			echo byteidxcomp(s, 1)
			echo byteidxcomp(s, 2)
<		The first and third echo result in 3 ('e' plus composing
		character is 3 bytes), the second echo results in 1 ('e' is
		one byte).
		Only works different from byteidx() when 'encoding' is set to
		a Unicode encoding.

call({func}, {arglist} [, {dict}])			*call()* *E699*
		Call function {func} with the items in |List| {arglist} as
		arguments.
		{func} can either be a |Funcref| or the name of a function.
		a:firstline and a:lastline are set to the cursor line.
		Returns the return value of the called function.
		{dict} is for functions with the "dict" attribute.  It will be
		used to set the local variable "self". |Dictionary-function|

ceil({expr})							*ceil()*
		Return the smallest integral value greater than or equal to
		{expr} as a |Float| (round up).
		{expr} must evaluate to a |Float| or a |Number|.
		Examples: >
			echo ceil(1.456)
<			2.0  >
			echo ceil(-5.456)
<			-5.0  >
			echo ceil(4.0)
<			4.0
		{only available when compiled with the |+float| feature}

changenr()						*changenr()*
		Return the number of the most recent change.  This is the same
		number as what is displayed with |:undolist| and can be used
		with the |:undo| command.
		When a change was made it is the number of that change.  After
		redo it is the number of the redone change.  After undo it is
		one less than the number of the undone change.

char2nr({expr}[, {utf8}])					*char2nr()*
		Return number value of the first char in {expr}.  Examples: >
			char2nr(" ")		returns 32
			char2nr("ABC")		returns 65
<		When {utf8} is omitted or zero, the current 'encoding' is used.
		Example for "utf-8": >
			char2nr("á")		returns 225
			char2nr("á"[0])		returns 195
<		With {utf8} set to 1, always treat as utf-8 characters.
		A combining character is a separate character.
		|nr2char()| does the opposite.

cindent({lnum})						*cindent()*
		Get the amount of indent for line {lnum} according the C
		indenting rules, as with 'cindent'.
		The indent is counted in spaces, the value of 'tabstop' is
		relevant.  {lnum} is used just like in |getline()|.
		When {lnum} is invalid or Vim was not compiled the |+cindent|
		feature, -1 is returned.
		See |C-indenting|.

clearmatches()						*clearmatches()*
		Clears all matches previously defined by |matchadd()| and the
		|:match| commands.

							*col()*
col({expr})	The result is a Number, which is the byte index of the column
		position given with {expr}.  The accepted positions are:
		    .	    the cursor position
		    $	    the end of the cursor line (the result is the
			    number of bytes in the cursor line plus one)
		    'x	    position of mark x (if the mark is not set, 0 is
			    returned)
		Additionally {expr} can be [lnum, col]: a |List| with the line
		and column number. Most useful when the column is "$", to get
		the last column of a specific line.  When "lnum" or "col" is
		out of range then col() returns zero.
		To get the line number use |line()|.  To get both use
		|getpos()|.
		For the screen column position use |virtcol()|.
		Note that only marks in the current file can be used.
		Examples: >
			col(".")		column of cursor
			col("$")		length of cursor line plus one
			col("'t")		column of mark t
			col("'" . markname)	column of mark markname
<		The first column is 1.	0 is returned for an error.
		For an uppercase mark the column may actually be in another
		buffer.
		For the cursor position, when 'virtualedit' is active, the
		column is one higher if the cursor is after the end of the
		line.  This can be used to obtain the column in Insert mode: >
			:imap <F2> <C-O>:let save_ve = &ve<CR>
				\<C-O>:set ve=all<CR>
				\<C-O>:echo col(".") . "\n" <Bar>
				\let &ve = save_ve<CR>
<

complete({startcol}, {matches})			*complete()* *E785*
		Set the matches for Insert mode completion.
		Can only be used in Insert mode.  You need to use a mapping
		with CTRL-R = |i_CTRL-R|.  It does not work after CTRL-O or
		with an expression mapping.
		{startcol} is the byte offset in the line where the completed
		text start.  The text up to the cursor is the original text
		that will be replaced by the matches.  Use col('.') for an
		empty string.  "col('.') - 1" will replace one character by a
		match.
		{matches} must be a |List|.  Each |List| item is one match.
		See |complete-items| for the kind of items that are possible.
		Note that the after calling this function you need to avoid
		inserting anything that would cause completion to stop.
		The match can be selected with CTRL-N and CTRL-P as usual with
		Insert mode completion.  The popup menu will appear if
		specified, see |ins-completion-menu|.
		Example: >
	inoremap <F5> <C-R>=ListMonths()<CR>

	func! ListMonths()
	  call complete(col('.'), ['January', 'February', 'March',
		\ 'April', 'May', 'June', 'July', 'August', 'September',
		\ 'October', 'November', 'December'])
	  return ''
	endfunc
<		This isn't very useful, but it shows how it works.  Note that
		an empty string is returned to avoid a zero being inserted.

complete_add({expr})				*complete_add()*
		Add {expr} to the list of matches.  Only to be used by the
		function specified with the 'completefunc' option.
		Returns 0 for failure (empty string or out of memory),
		1 when the match was added, 2 when the match was already in
		the list.
		See |complete-functions| for an explanation of {expr}.	It is
		the same as one item in the list that 'omnifunc' would return.

complete_check()				*complete_check()*
		Check for a key typed while looking for completion matches.
		This is to be used when looking for matches takes some time.
		Returns non-zero when searching for matches is to be aborted,
		zero otherwise.
		Only to be used by the function specified with the
		'completefunc' option.

						*confirm()*
confirm({msg} [, {choices} [, {default} [, {type}]]])
		Confirm() offers the user a dialog, from which a choice can be
		made.  It returns the number of the choice.  For the first
		choice this is 1.
		Note: confirm() is only supported when compiled with dialog
		support, see |+dialog_con| and |+dialog_gui|.

		{msg} is displayed in a |dialog| with {choices} as the
		alternatives.  When {choices} is missing or empty, "&OK" is
		used (and translated).
		{msg} is a String, use '\n' to include a newline.  Only on
		some systems the string is wrapped when it doesn't fit.

		{choices} is a String, with the individual choices separated
		by '\n', e.g. >
			confirm("Save changes?", "&Yes\n&No\n&Cancel")
<		The letter after the '&' is the shortcut key for that choice.
		Thus you can type 'c' to select "Cancel".  The shortcut does
		not need to be the first letter: >
			confirm("file has been modified", "&Save\nSave &All")
<		For the console, the first letter of each choice is used as
		the default shortcut key.

		The optional {default} argument is the number of the choice
		that is made if the user hits <CR>.  Use 1 to make the first
		choice the default one.  Use 0 to not set a default.  If
		{default} is omitted, 1 is used.

		The optional {type} argument gives the type of dialog.  This
		is only used for the icon of the GTK, Mac, Motif and Win32
		GUI.  It can be one of these values: "Error", "Question",
		"Info", "Warning" or "Generic".  Only the first character is
		relevant.  When {type} is omitted, "Generic" is used.

		If the user aborts the dialog by pressing <Esc>, CTRL-C,
		or another valid interrupt key, confirm() returns 0.

		An example: >
   :let choice = confirm("What do you want?", "&Apples\n&Oranges\n&Bananas", 2)
   :if choice == 0
   :	echo "make up your mind!"
   :elseif choice == 3
   :	echo "tasteful"
   :else
   :	echo "I prefer bananas myself."
   :endif
<		In a GUI dialog, buttons are used.  The layout of the buttons
		depends on the 'v' flag in 'guioptions'.  If it is included,
		the buttons are always put vertically.	Otherwise,  confirm()
		tries to put the buttons in one horizontal line.  If they
		don't fit, a vertical layout is used anyway.  For some systems
		the horizontal layout is always used.

							*copy()*
copy({expr})	Make a copy of {expr}.	For Numbers and Strings this isn't
		different from using {expr} directly.
		When {expr} is a |List| a shallow copy is created.  This means
		that the original |List| can be changed without changing the
		copy, and vice versa.  But the items are identical, thus
		changing an item changes the contents of both |Lists|.	Also
		see |deepcopy()|.

cos({expr})						*cos()*
		Return the cosine of {expr}, measured in radians, as a |Float|.
		{expr} must evaluate to a |Float| or a |Number|.
		Examples: >
			:echo cos(100)
<			0.862319 >
			:echo cos(-4.01)
<			-0.646043
		{only available when compiled with the |+float| feature}


cosh({expr})						*cosh()*
		Return the hyperbolic cosine of {expr} as a |Float| in the range
		[1, inf].
		{expr} must evaluate to a |Float| or a |Number|.
		Examples: >
			:echo cosh(0.5)
<			1.127626 >
			:echo cosh(-0.5)
<			-1.127626
		{only available when compiled with the |+float| feature}

		
count({comp}, {expr} [, {ic} [, {start}]])			*count()*
		Return the number of times an item with value {expr} appears
		in |List| or |Dictionary| {comp}.
		If {start} is given then start with the item with this index.
		{start} can only be used with a |List|.
		When {ic} is given and it's non-zero then case is ignored.


							*cscope_connection()*
cscope_connection([{num} , {dbpath} [, {prepend}]])
		Checks for the existence of a |cscope| connection.  If no
		parameters are specified, then the function returns:
			0, if cscope was not available (not compiled in), or
			   if there are no cscope connections;
			1, if there is at least one cscope connection.

		If parameters are specified, then the value of {num}
		determines how existence of a cscope connection is checked:

		{num}	Description of existence check
		-----	------------------------------
		0	Same as no parameters (e.g., "cscope_connection()").
		1	Ignore {prepend}, and use partial string matches for
			{dbpath}.
		2	Ignore {prepend}, and use exact string matches for
			{dbpath}.
		3	Use {prepend}, use partial string matches for both
			{dbpath} and {prepend}.
		4	Use {prepend}, use exact string matches for both
			{dbpath} and {prepend}.

		Note: All string comparisons are case sensitive!

		Examples.  Suppose we had the following (from ":cs show"): >

  # pid    database name			prepend path
  0 27664  cscope.out				/usr/local
<
		Invocation					Return Val ~
		----------					---------- >
		cscope_connection()					1
		cscope_connection(1, "out")				1
		cscope_connection(2, "out")				0
		cscope_connection(3, "out")				0
		cscope_connection(3, "out", "local")			1
		cscope_connection(4, "out")				0
		cscope_connection(4, "out", "local")			0
		cscope_connection(4, "cscope.out", "/usr/local")	1
<
cursor({lnum}, {col} [, {off}])				*cursor()*
cursor({list})
		Positions the cursor at the column (byte count) {col} in the
		line {lnum}.  The first column is one.

		When there is one argument {list} this is used as a |List|
		with two, three or four item:
			[{lnum}, {col}, {off}]
			[{lnum}, {col}, {off}, {curswant}]
		This is like the return value of |getpos()| or |getcurpos()|,
		but without the first item.

		Does not change the jumplist.
		If {lnum} is greater than the number of lines in the buffer,
		the cursor will be positioned at the last line in the buffer.
		If {lnum} is zero, the cursor will stay in the current line.
		If {col} is greater than the number of bytes in the line,
		the cursor will be positioned at the last character in the
		line.
		If {col} is zero, the cursor will stay in the current column.
		If {curswant} is given it is used to set the preferred column
		for vertical movement.  Otherwise {col} is used.
		When 'virtualedit' is used {off} specifies the offset in
		screen columns from the start of the character.  E.g., a
		position within a <Tab> or after the last character.
		Returns 0 when the position could be set, -1 otherwise.


deepcopy({expr}[, {noref}])				*deepcopy()* *E698*
		Make a copy of {expr}.	For Numbers and Strings this isn't
		different from using {expr} directly.
		When {expr} is a |List| a full copy is created.  This means
		that the original |List| can be changed without changing the
		copy, and vice versa.  When an item is a |List|, a copy for it
		is made, recursively.  Thus changing an item in the copy does
		not change the contents of the original |List|.
		When {noref} is omitted or zero a contained |List| or
		|Dictionary| is only copied once.  All references point to
		this single copy.  With {noref} set to 1 every occurrence of a
		|List| or |Dictionary| results in a new copy.  This also means
		that a cyclic reference causes deepcopy() to fail.
								*E724*
		Nesting is possible up to 100 levels.  When there is an item
		that refers back to a higher level making a deep copy with
		{noref} set to 1 will fail.
		Also see |copy()|.

delete({fname})							*delete()*
		Deletes the file by the name {fname}.  The result is a Number,
		which is 0 if the file was deleted successfully, and non-zero
		when the deletion failed.
		Use |remove()| to delete an item from a |List|.
		To delete a line from the buffer use |:delete|.  Use |:exe|
		when the line number is in a variable.

							*did_filetype()*
did_filetype()	Returns non-zero when autocommands are being executed and the
		FileType event has been triggered at least once.  Can be used
		to avoid triggering the FileType event again in the scripts
		that detect the file type. |FileType|
		When editing another file, the counter is reset, thus this
		really checks if the FileType event has been triggered for the
		current buffer.  This allows an autocommand that starts
		editing another buffer to set 'filetype' and load a syntax
		file.

diff_filler({lnum})					*diff_filler()*
		Returns the number of filler lines above line {lnum}.
		These are the lines that were inserted at this point in
		another diff'ed window.  These filler lines are shown in the
		display but don't exist in the buffer.
		{lnum} is used like with |getline()|.  Thus "." is the current
		line, "'m" mark m, etc.
		Returns 0 if the current window is not in diff mode.

diff_hlID({lnum}, {col})				*diff_hlID()*
		Returns the highlight ID for diff mode at line {lnum} column
		{col} (byte index).  When the current line does not have a
		diff change zero is returned.
		{lnum} is used like with |getline()|.  Thus "." is the current
		line, "'m" mark m, etc.
		{col} is 1 for the leftmost column, {lnum} is 1 for the first
		line.
		The highlight ID can be used with |synIDattr()| to obtain
		syntax information about the highlighting.

empty({expr})						*empty()*
		Return the Number 1 if {expr} is empty, zero otherwise.
		A |List| or |Dictionary| is empty when it does not have any
		items.	A Number is empty when its value is zero.
		For a long |List| this is much faster than comparing the
		length with zero.

escape({string}, {chars})				*escape()*
		Escape the characters in {chars} that occur in {string} with a
		backslash.  Example: >
			:echo escape('c:\program files\vim', ' \')
<		results in: >
			c:\\program\ files\\vim
<		Also see |shellescape()|.

							*eval()*
eval({string})	Evaluate {string} and return the result.  Especially useful to
		turn the result of |string()| back into the original value.
		This works for Numbers, Floats, Strings and composites of
		them.  Also works for |Funcref|s that refer to existing
		functions.

eventhandler()						*eventhandler()*
		Returns 1 when inside an event handler.  That is that Vim got
		interrupted while waiting for the user to type a character,
		e.g., when dropping a file on Vim.  This means interactive
		commands cannot be used.  Otherwise zero is returned.

executable({expr})					*executable()*
		This function checks if an executable with the name {expr}
		exists.  {expr} must be the name of the program without any
		arguments.
		executable() uses the value of $PATH and/or the normal
		searchpath for programs.		*PATHEXT*
		On MS-DOS and MS-Windows the ".exe", ".bat", etc. can
		optionally be included.  Then the extensions in $PATHEXT are
		tried.	Thus if "foo.exe" does not exist, "foo.exe.bat" can be
		found.	If $PATHEXT is not set then ".exe;.com;.bat;.cmd" is
		used.  A dot by itself can be used in $PATHEXT to try using
		the name without an extension.	When 'shell' looks like a
		Unix shell, then the name is also tried without adding an
		extension.
		On MS-DOS and MS-Windows it only checks if the file exists and
		is not a directory, not if it's really executable.
		On MS-Windows an executable in the same directory as Vim is
		always found.  Since this directory is added to $PATH it
		should also work to execute it |win32-PATH|.
		The result is a Number:
			1	exists
			0	does not exist
			-1	not implemented on this system

exepath({expr})						*exepath()*
		If {expr} is an executable and is either an absolute path, a
		relative path or found in $PATH, return the full path.
		Note that the current directory is used when {expr} starts
		with "./", which may be a problem for Vim: >
			echo exepath(v:progpath)
<		If {expr} cannot be found in $PATH or is not executable then
		an empty string is returned.

							*exists()*
exists({expr})	The result is a Number, which is non-zero if {expr} is
		defined, zero otherwise.  The {expr} argument is a string,
		which contains one of these:
			&option-name	Vim option (only checks if it exists,
					not if it really works)
			+option-name	Vim option that works.
			$ENVNAME	environment variable (could also be
					done by comparing with an empty
					string)
			*funcname	built-in function (see |functions|)
					or user defined function (see
					|user-functions|). Also works for a
					variable that is a Funcref.
			varname		internal variable (see
					|internal-variables|).	Also works
					for |curly-braces-names|, |Dictionary|
					entries, |List| items, etc.  Beware
					that evaluating an index may cause an
					error message for an invalid
					expression.  E.g.: >
					   :let l = [1, 2, 3]
					   :echo exists("l[5]")
<					   0 >
					   :echo exists("l[xx]")
<					   E121: Undefined variable: xx
					   0
			:cmdname	Ex command: built-in command, user
					command or command modifier |:command|.
					Returns:
					1  for match with start of a command
					2  full match with a command
					3  matches several user commands
					To check for a supported command
					always check the return value to be 2.
			:2match		The |:2match| command.
			:3match		The |:3match| command.
			#event		autocommand defined for this event
			#event#pattern	autocommand defined for this event and
					pattern (the pattern is taken
					literally and compared to the
					autocommand patterns character by
					character)
			#group		autocommand group exists
			#group#event	autocommand defined for this group and
					event.
			#group#event#pattern
					autocommand defined for this group,
					event and pattern.
			##event		autocommand for this event is
					supported.
		For checking for a supported feature use |has()|.

		Examples: >
			exists("&shortname")
			exists("$HOSTNAME")
			exists("*strftime")
			exists("*s:MyFunc")
			exists("bufcount")
			exists(":Make")
			exists("#CursorHold")
			exists("#BufReadPre#*.gz")
			exists("#filetypeindent")
			exists("#filetypeindent#FileType")
			exists("#filetypeindent#FileType#*")
			exists("##ColorScheme")
<		There must be no space between the symbol (&/$/*/#) and the
		name.
		There must be no extra characters after the name, although in
		a few cases this is ignored.  That may become more strict in
		the future, thus don't count on it!
		Working example: >
			exists(":make")
<		NOT working example: >
			exists(":make install")

<		Note that the argument must be a string, not the name of the
		variable itself.  For example: >
			exists(bufcount)
<		This doesn't check for existence of the "bufcount" variable,
		but gets the value of "bufcount", and checks if that exists.

exp({expr})						*exp()*
		Return the exponential of {expr} as a |Float| in the range
		[0, inf].
		{expr} must evaluate to a |Float| or a |Number|.
		Examples: >
			:echo exp(2)
<			7.389056 >
			:echo exp(-1)
<			0.367879
		{only available when compiled with the |+float| feature}


expand({expr} [, {nosuf} [, {list}]])				*expand()*
		Expand wildcards and the following special keywords in {expr}.
		'wildignorecase' applies.

		If {list} is given and it is non-zero, a List will be returned.
		Otherwise the result is a String and when there are several
		matches, they are separated by <NL> characters.  [Note: in
		version 5.0 a space was used, which caused problems when a
		file name contains a space]

		If the expansion fails, the result is an empty string.	A name
		for a non-existing file is not included, unless {expr} does
		not start with '%', '#' or '<', see below.

		When {expr} starts with '%', '#' or '<', the expansion is done
		like for the |cmdline-special| variables with their associated
		modifiers.  Here is a short overview:

			%		current file name
			#		alternate file name
			#n		alternate file name n
			<cfile>		file name under the cursor
			<afile>		autocmd file name
			<abuf>		autocmd buffer number (as a String!)
			<amatch>	autocmd matched name
			<sfile>		sourced script file or function name
			<slnum>		sourced script file line number
			<cword>		word under the cursor
			<cWORD>		WORD under the cursor
			<client>	the {clientid} of the last received
					message |server2client()|
		Modifiers:
			:p		expand to full path
			:h		head (last path component removed)
			:t		tail (last path component only)
			:r		root (one extension removed)
			:e		extension only

		Example: >
			:let &tags = expand("%:p:h") . "/tags"
<		Note that when expanding a string that starts with '%', '#' or
		'<', any following text is ignored.  This does NOT work: >
			:let doesntwork = expand("%:h.bak")
<		Use this: >
			:let doeswork = expand("%:h") . ".bak"
<		Also note that expanding "<cfile>" and others only returns the
		referenced file name without further expansion.  If "<cfile>"
		is "~/.cshrc", you need to do another expand() to have the
		"~/" expanded into the path of the home directory: >
			:echo expand(expand("<cfile>"))
<
		There cannot be white space between the variables and the
		following modifier.  The |fnamemodify()| function can be used
		to modify normal file names.

		When using '%' or '#', and the current or alternate file name
		is not defined, an empty string is used.  Using "%:p" in a
		buffer with no name, results in the current directory, with a
		'/' added.

		When {expr} does not start with '%', '#' or '<', it is
		expanded like a file name is expanded on the command line.
		'suffixes' and 'wildignore' are used, unless the optional
		{nosuf} argument is given and it is non-zero.
		Names for non-existing files are included.  The "**" item can
		be used to search in a directory tree.  For example, to find
		all "README" files in the current directory and below: >
			:echo expand("**/README")
<
		Expand() can also be used to expand variables and environment
		variables that are only known in a shell.  But this can be
		slow, because a shell may be used to do the expansion.  See
		|expr-env-expand|.
		The expanded variable is still handled like a list of file
		names.	When an environment variable cannot be expanded, it is
		left unchanged.  Thus ":echo expand('$FOOBAR')" results in
		"$FOOBAR".

		See |glob()| for finding existing files.  See |system()| for
		getting the raw output of an external command.

extend({expr1}, {expr2} [, {expr3}])			*extend()*
		{expr1} and {expr2} must be both |Lists| or both
		|Dictionaries|.

		If they are |Lists|: Append {expr2} to {expr1}.
		If {expr3} is given insert the items of {expr2} before item
		{expr3} in {expr1}.  When {expr3} is zero insert before the
		first item.  When {expr3} is equal to len({expr1}) then
		{expr2} is appended.
		Examples: >
			:echo sort(extend(mylist, [7, 5]))
			:call extend(mylist, [2, 3], 1)
<		When {expr1} is the same List as {expr2} then the number of
		items copied is equal to the original length of the List.
		E.g., when {expr3} is 1 you get N new copies of the first item
		(where N is the original length of the List).
		Use |add()| to concatenate one item to a list.	To concatenate
		two lists into a new list use the + operator: >
			:let newlist = [1, 2, 3] + [4, 5]
<
		If they are |Dictionaries|:
		Add all entries from {expr2} to {expr1}.
		If a key exists in both {expr1} and {expr2} then {expr3} is
		used to decide what to do:
		{expr3} = "keep": keep the value of {expr1}
		{expr3} = "force": use the value of {expr2}
		{expr3} = "error": give an error message		*E737*
		When {expr3} is omitted then "force" is assumed.

		{expr1} is changed when {expr2} is not empty.  If necessary
		make a copy of {expr1} first.
		{expr2} remains unchanged.
		Returns {expr1}.


feedkeys({string} [, {mode}])				*feedkeys()*
		Characters in {string} are queued for processing as if they
		come from a mapping or were typed by the user.	They are added
		to the end of the typeahead buffer, thus if a mapping is still
		being executed these characters come after them.
		The function does not wait for processing of keys contained in
		{string}.
		To include special keys into {string}, use double-quotes
		and "\..." notation |expr-quote|. For example,
		feedkeys("\<CR>") simulates pressing of the <Enter> key. But
		feedkeys('\<CR>') pushes 5 characters.
		If {mode} is absent, keys are remapped.
		{mode} is a String, which can contain these character flags:
		'm'	Remap keys. This is default.
		'n'	Do not remap keys.
		't'	Handle keys as if typed; otherwise they are handled as
			if coming from a mapping.  This matters for undo,
			opening folds, etc.
		Return value is always 0.

filereadable({file})					*filereadable()*
		The result is a Number, which is TRUE when a file with the
		name {file} exists, and can be read.  If {file} doesn't exist,
		or is a directory, the result is FALSE.  {file} is any
		expression, which is used as a String.
		If you don't care about the file being readable you can use
		|glob()|.
							*file_readable()*
		Obsolete name: file_readable().


filewritable({file})					*filewritable()*
		The result is a Number, which is 1 when a file with the
		name {file} exists, and can be written.  If {file} doesn't
		exist, or is not writable, the result is 0.  If {file} is a
		directory, and we can write to it, the result is 2.


filter({expr}, {string})					*filter()*
		{expr} must be a |List| or a |Dictionary|.
		For each item in {expr} evaluate {string} and when the result
		is zero remove the item from the |List| or |Dictionary|.
		Inside {string} |v:val| has the value of the current item.
		For a |Dictionary| |v:key| has the key of the current item.
		Examples: >
			:call filter(mylist, 'v:val !~ "OLD"')
<		Removes the items where "OLD" appears. >
			:call filter(mydict, 'v:key >= 8')
<		Removes the items with a key below 8. >
			:call filter(var, 0)
<		Removes all the items, thus clears the |List| or |Dictionary|.

		Note that {string} is the result of expression and is then
		used as an expression again.  Often it is good to use a
		|literal-string| to avoid having to double backslashes.

		The operation is done in-place.  If you want a |List| or
		|Dictionary| to remain unmodified make a copy first: >
			:let l = filter(copy(mylist), 'v:val =~ "KEEP"')

<		Returns {expr}, the |List| or |Dictionary| that was filtered.
		When an error is encountered while evaluating {string} no
		further items in {expr} are processed.


finddir({name}[, {path}[, {count}]])				*finddir()*
		Find directory {name} in {path}.  Supports both downwards and
		upwards recursive directory searches.  See |file-searching|
		for the syntax of {path}.
		Returns the path of the first found match.  When the found
		directory is below the current directory a relative path is
		returned.  Otherwise a full path is returned.
		If {path} is omitted or empty then 'path' is used.
		If the optional {count} is given, find {count}'s occurrence of
		{name} in {path} instead of the first one.
		When {count} is negative return all the matches in a |List|.
		This is quite similar to the ex-command |:find|.
		{only available when compiled with the |+file_in_path|
		feature}

findfile({name}[, {path}[, {count}]])				*findfile()*
		Just like |finddir()|, but find a file instead of a directory.
		Uses 'suffixesadd'.
		Example: >
			:echo findfile("tags.vim", ".;")
<		Searches from the directory of the current file upwards until
		it finds the file "tags.vim".

float2nr({expr})					*float2nr()*
		Convert {expr} to a Number by omitting the part after the
		decimal point.
		{expr} must evaluate to a |Float| or a Number.
		When the value of {expr} is out of range for a |Number| the
		result is truncated to 0x7fffffff or -0x7fffffff.  NaN results
		in -0x80000000.
		Examples: >
			echo float2nr(3.95)
<			3  >
			echo float2nr(-23.45)
<			-23  >
			echo float2nr(1.0e100)
<			2147483647  >
			echo float2nr(-1.0e150)
<			-2147483647  >
			echo float2nr(1.0e-100)
<			0
		{only available when compiled with the |+float| feature}


floor({expr})							*floor()*
		Return the largest integral value less than or equal to
		{expr} as a |Float| (round down).
		{expr} must evaluate to a |Float| or a |Number|.
		Examples: >
			echo floor(1.856)
<			1.0  >
			echo floor(-5.456)
<			-6.0  >
			echo floor(4.0)
<			4.0
		{only available when compiled with the |+float| feature}
		

fmod({expr1}, {expr2})					*fmod()*
		Return the remainder of {expr1} / {expr2}, even if the
		division is not representable.  Returns {expr1} - i * {expr2}
		for some integer i such that if {expr2} is non-zero, the
		result has the same sign as {expr1} and magnitude less than
		the magnitude of {expr2}.  If {expr2} is zero, the value
		returned is zero.  The value returned is a |Float|.
		{expr1} and {expr2} must evaluate to a |Float| or a |Number|.
		Examples: >
			:echo fmod(12.33, 1.22)
<			0.13 >
			:echo fmod(-12.33, 1.22)
<			-0.13
		{only available when compiled with |+float| feature}


fnameescape({string})					*fnameescape()*
		Escape {string} for use as file name command argument.	All
		characters that have a special meaning, such as '%' and '|'
		are escaped with a backslash.
		For most systems the characters escaped are
		" \t\n*?[{`$\\%#'\"|!<".  For systems where a backslash
		appears in a filename, it depends on the value of 'isfname'.
		A leading '+' and '>' is also escaped (special after |:edit|
		and |:write|).  And a "-" by itself (special after |:cd|).
		Example: >
			:let fname = '+some str%nge|name'
			:exe "edit " . fnameescape(fname)
<		results in executing: >
			edit \+some\ str\%nge\|name

fnamemodify({fname}, {mods})				*fnamemodify()*
		Modify file name {fname} according to {mods}.  {mods} is a
		string of characters like it is used for file names on the
		command line.  See |filename-modifiers|.
		Example: >
			:echo fnamemodify("main.c", ":p:h")
<		results in: >
			/home/mool/vim/vim/src
<		Note: Environment variables don't work in {fname}, use
		|expand()| first then.

foldclosed({lnum})					*foldclosed()*
		The result is a Number.  If the line {lnum} is in a closed
		fold, the result is the number of the first line in that fold.
		If the line {lnum} is not in a closed fold, -1 is returned.

foldclosedend({lnum})					*foldclosedend()*
		The result is a Number.  If the line {lnum} is in a closed
		fold, the result is the number of the last line in that fold.
		If the line {lnum} is not in a closed fold, -1 is returned.

foldlevel({lnum})					*foldlevel()*
		The result is a Number, which is the foldlevel of line {lnum}
		in the current buffer.	For nested folds the deepest level is
		returned.  If there is no fold at line {lnum}, zero is
		returned.  It doesn't matter if the folds are open or closed.
		When used while updating folds (from 'foldexpr') -1 is
		returned for lines where folds are still to be updated and the
		foldlevel is unknown.  As a special case the level of the
		previous line is usually available.

							*foldtext()*
foldtext()	Returns a String, to be displayed for a closed fold.  This is
		the default function used for the 'foldtext' option and should
		only be called from evaluating 'foldtext'.  It uses the
		|v:foldstart|, |v:foldend| and |v:folddashes| variables.
		The returned string looks like this: >
			+-- 45 lines: abcdef
<		The number of dashes depends on the foldlevel.	The "45" is
		the number of lines in the fold.  "abcdef" is the text in the
		first non-blank line of the fold.  Leading white space, "//"
		or "/*" and the text from the 'foldmarker' and 'commentstring'
		options is removed.
		{not available when compiled without the |+folding| feature}

foldtextresult({lnum})					*foldtextresult()*
		Returns the text that is displayed for the closed fold at line
		{lnum}.  Evaluates 'foldtext' in the appropriate context.
		When there is no closed fold at {lnum} an empty string is
		returned.
		{lnum} is used like with |getline()|.  Thus "." is the current
		line, "'m" mark m, etc.
		Useful when exporting folded text, e.g., to HTML.
		{not available when compiled without the |+folding| feature}

							*foreground()*
foreground()	Move the Vim window to the foreground.	Useful when sent from
		a client to a Vim server. |remote_send()|
		On Win32 systems this might not work, the OS does not always
		allow a window to bring itself to the foreground.  Use
		|remote_foreground()| instead.
		{only in the Win32, Athena, Motif and GTK GUI versions and the
		Win32 console version}


function({name})					*function()* *E700*
		Return a |Funcref| variable that refers to function {name}.
		{name} can be a user defined function or an internal function.


garbagecollect([{atexit}])				*garbagecollect()*
		Cleanup unused |Lists| and |Dictionaries| that have circular
		references.  There is hardly ever a need to invoke this
		function, as it is automatically done when Vim runs out of
		memory or is waiting for the user to press a key after
		'updatetime'.  Items without circular references are always
		freed when they become unused.
		This is useful if you have deleted a very big |List| and/or
		|Dictionary| with circular references in a script that runs
		for a long time.
		When the optional {atexit} argument is one, garbage
		collection will also be done when exiting Vim, if it wasn't
		done before.  This is useful when checking for memory leaks.

get({list}, {idx} [, {default}])			*get()*
		Get item {idx} from |List| {list}.  When this item is not
		available return {default}.  Return zero when {default} is
		omitted.
get({dict}, {key} [, {default}])
		Get item with key {key} from |Dictionary| {dict}.  When this
		item is not available return {default}.  Return zero when
		{default} is omitted.

							*getbufline()*
getbufline({expr}, {lnum} [, {end}])
		Return a |List| with the lines starting from {lnum} to {end}
		(inclusive) in the buffer {expr}.  If {end} is omitted, a
		|List| with only the line {lnum} is returned.

		For the use of {expr}, see |bufname()| above.

		For {lnum} and {end} "$" can be used for the last line of the
		buffer.  Otherwise a number must be used.

		When {lnum} is smaller than 1 or bigger than the number of
		lines in the buffer, an empty |List| is returned.

		When {end} is greater than the number of lines in the buffer,
		it is treated as {end} is set to the number of lines in the
		buffer.  When {end} is before {lnum} an empty |List| is
		returned.

		This function works only for loaded buffers.  For unloaded and
		non-existing buffers, an empty |List| is returned.

		Example: >
			:let lines = getbufline(bufnr("myfile"), 1, "$")

getbufvar({expr}, {varname} [, {def}])				*getbufvar()*
		The result is the value of option or local buffer variable
		{varname} in buffer {expr}.  Note that the name without "b:"
		must be used.
		When {varname} is empty returns a dictionary with all the
		buffer-local variables.
		This also works for a global or buffer-local option, but it
		doesn't work for a global variable, window-local variable or
		window-local option.
		For the use of {expr}, see |bufname()| above.
		When the buffer or variable doesn't exist {def} or an empty
		string is returned, there is no error message.
		Examples: >
			:let bufmodified = getbufvar(1, "&mod")
			:echo "todo myvar = " . getbufvar("todo", "myvar")
<
getchar([expr])						*getchar()*
		Get a single character from the user or input stream.
		If [expr] is omitted, wait until a character is available.
		If [expr] is 0, only get a character when one is available.
			Return zero otherwise.
		If [expr] is 1, only check if a character is available, it is
			not consumed.  Return zero if no character available.

		Without [expr] and when [expr] is 0 a whole character or
		special key is returned.  If it is an 8-bit character, the
		result is a number.  Use nr2char() to convert it to a String.
		Otherwise a String is returned with the encoded character.
		For a special key it's a sequence of bytes starting with 0x80
		(decimal: 128).  This is the same value as the string
		"\<Key>", e.g., "\<Left>".  The returned value is also a
		String when a modifier (shift, control, alt) was used that is
		not included in the character.

		When [expr] is 0 and Esc is typed, there will be a short delay
		while Vim waits to see if this is the start of an escape
		sequence.

		When [expr] is 1 only the first byte is returned.  For a
		one-byte character it is the character itself as a number.
		Use nr2char() to convert it to a String.

		Use getcharmod() to obtain any additional modifiers.

		When the user clicks a mouse button, the mouse event will be
		returned.  The position can then be found in |v:mouse_col|,
		|v:mouse_lnum| and |v:mouse_win|.  This example positions the
		mouse as it would normally happen: >
			let c = getchar()
			if c == "\<LeftMouse>" && v:mouse_win > 0
			  exe v:mouse_win . "wincmd w"
			  exe v:mouse_lnum
			  exe "normal " . v:mouse_col . "|"
			endif
<
		There is no prompt, you will somehow have to make clear to the
		user that a character has to be typed.
		There is no mapping for the character.
		Key codes are replaced, thus when the user presses the <Del>
		key you get the code for the <Del> key, not the raw character
		sequence.  Examples: >
			getchar() == "\<Del>"
			getchar() == "\<S-Left>"
<		This example redefines "f" to ignore case: >
			:nmap f :call FindChar()<CR>
			:function FindChar()
			:  let c = nr2char(getchar())
			:  while col('.') < col('$') - 1
			:    normal l
			:    if getline('.')[col('.') - 1] ==? c
			:      break
			:    endif
			:  endwhile
			:endfunction

getcharmod()						*getcharmod()*
		The result is a Number which is the state of the modifiers for
		the last obtained character with getchar() or in another way.
		These values are added together:
			2	shift
			4	control
			8	alt (meta)
			16	meta (when it's different from ALT)
			32	mouse double click
			64	mouse triple click
			96	mouse quadruple click (== 32 + 64)
			128	command (Macintosh only)
		Only the modifiers that have not been included in the
		character itself are obtained.	Thus Shift-a results in "A"
		without a modifier.

getcmdline()						*getcmdline()*
		Return the current command-line.  Only works when the command
		line is being edited, thus requires use of |c_CTRL-\_e| or
		|c_CTRL-R_=|.
		Example: >
			:cmap <F7> <C-\>eescape(getcmdline(), ' \')<CR>
<		Also see |getcmdtype()|, |getcmdpos()| and |setcmdpos()|.

getcmdpos()						*getcmdpos()*
		Return the position of the cursor in the command line as a
		byte count.  The first column is 1.
		Only works when editing the command line, thus requires use of
		|c_CTRL-\_e| or |c_CTRL-R_=| or an expression mapping.
		Returns 0 otherwise.
		Also see |getcmdtype()|, |setcmdpos()| and |getcmdline()|.

getcmdtype()						*getcmdtype()*
		Return the current command-line type. Possible return values
		are:
		    :	normal Ex command
		    >	debug mode command |debug-mode|
		    /	forward search command
		    ?	backward search command
		    @	|input()| command
		    -	|:insert| or |:append| command
		    =	|i_CTRL-R_=|
		Only works when editing the command line, thus requires use of
		|c_CTRL-\_e| or |c_CTRL-R_=| or an expression mapping.
		Returns an empty string otherwise.
		Also see |getcmdpos()|, |setcmdpos()| and |getcmdline()|.

getcmdwintype()						*getcmdwintype()*
		Return the current |command-line-window| type. Possible return
		values are the same as |getcmdtype()|. Returns an empty string
		when not in the command-line window.

							*getcurpos()*
getcurpos()	Get the position of the cursor.  This is like getpos('.'), but
		includes an extra item in the list:
		    [bufnum, lnum, col, off, curswant]
		The "curswant" number is the preferred column when moving the
		cursor vertically.
		This can be used to save and restore the cursor position: >
			let save_cursor = getcurpos()
			MoveTheCursorAround
			call setpos('.', save_cursor)
<
							*getcwd()*
getcwd()	The result is a String, which is the name of the current
		working directory.

getfsize({fname})					*getfsize()*
		The result is a Number, which is the size in bytes of the
		given file {fname}.
		If {fname} is a directory, 0 is returned.
		If the file {fname} can't be found, -1 is returned.
		If the size of {fname} is too big to fit in a Number then -2
		is returned.

getfontname([{name}])					*getfontname()*
		Without an argument returns the name of the normal font being
		used.  Like what is used for the Normal highlight group
		|hl-Normal|.
		With an argument a check is done whether {name} is a valid
		font name.  If not then an empty string is returned.
		Otherwise the actual font name is returned, or {name} if the
		GUI does not support obtaining the real name.
		Only works when the GUI is running, thus not in your vimrc or
		gvimrc file.  Use the |GUIEnter| autocommand to use this
		function just after the GUI has started.
		Note that the GTK 2 GUI accepts any font name, thus checking
		for a valid name does not work.

getfperm({fname})					*getfperm()*
		The result is a String, which is the read, write, and execute
		permissions of the given file {fname}.
		If {fname} does not exist or its directory cannot be read, an
		empty string is returned.
		The result is of the form "rwxrwxrwx", where each group of
		"rwx" flags represent, in turn, the permissions of the owner
		of the file, the group the file belongs to, and other users.
		If a user does not have a given permission the flag for this
		is replaced with the string "-".  Examples: >
			:echo getfperm("/etc/passwd")
			:echo getfperm(expand("~/.vimrc"))
<		This will hopefully (from a security point of view) display
		the string "rw-r--r--" or even "rw-------".

getftime({fname})					*getftime()*
		The result is a Number, which is the last modification time of
		the given file {fname}.  The value is measured as seconds
		since 1st Jan 1970, and may be passed to strftime().  See also
		|localtime()| and |strftime()|.
		If the file {fname} can't be found -1 is returned.

getftype({fname})					*getftype()*
		The result is a String, which is a description of the kind of
		file of the given file {fname}.
		If {fname} does not exist an empty string is returned.
		Here is a table over different kinds of files and their
		results:
			Normal file		"file"
			Directory		"dir"
			Symbolic link		"link"
			Block device		"bdev"
			Character device	"cdev"
			Socket			"socket"
			FIFO			"fifo"
			All other		"other"
		Example: >
			getftype("/home")
<		Note that a type such as "link" will only be returned on
		systems that support it.  On some systems only "dir" and
		"file" are returned.

							*getline()*
getline({lnum} [, {end}])
		Without {end} the result is a String, which is line {lnum}
		from the current buffer.  Example: >
			getline(1)
<		When {lnum} is a String that doesn't start with a
		digit, line() is called to translate the String into a Number.
		To get the line under the cursor: >
			getline(".")
<		When {lnum} is smaller than 1 or bigger than the number of
		lines in the buffer, an empty string is returned.

		When {end} is given the result is a |List| where each item is
		a line from the current buffer in the range {lnum} to {end},
		including line {end}.
		{end} is used in the same way as {lnum}.
		Non-existing lines are silently omitted.
		When {end} is before {lnum} an empty |List| is returned.
		Example: >
			:let start = line('.')
			:let end = search("^$") - 1
			:let lines = getline(start, end)

<		To get lines from another buffer see |getbufline()|

getloclist({nr})					*getloclist()*
		Returns a list with all the entries in the location list for
		window {nr}. When {nr} is zero the current window is used.
		For a location list window, the displayed location list is
		returned.  For an invalid window number {nr}, an empty list is
		returned. Otherwise, same as |getqflist()|.

getmatches()						*getmatches()*
		Returns a |List| with all matches previously defined by
		|matchadd()| and the |:match| commands.  |getmatches()| is
		useful in combination with |setmatches()|, as |setmatches()|
		can restore a list of matches saved by |getmatches()|.
		Example: >
			:echo getmatches()
<			[{'group': 'MyGroup1', 'pattern': 'TODO',
			'priority': 10, 'id': 1}, {'group': 'MyGroup2',
			'pattern': 'FIXME', 'priority': 10, 'id': 2}] >
			:let m = getmatches()
			:call clearmatches()
			:echo getmatches()
<			[] >
			:call setmatches(m)
			:echo getmatches()
<			[{'group': 'MyGroup1', 'pattern': 'TODO',
			'priority': 10, 'id': 1}, {'group': 'MyGroup2',
			'pattern': 'FIXME', 'priority': 10, 'id': 2}] >
			:unlet m
<
							*getpid()*
getpid()	Return a Number which is the process ID of the Vim process.
		On Unix and MS-Windows this is a unique number, until Vim
		exits.	On MS-DOS it's always zero.

							*getpos()*
getpos({expr})	Get the position for {expr}.  For possible values of {expr}
		see |line()|.  For getting the cursor position see
		|getcurpos()|.
		The result is a |List| with four numbers:
		    [bufnum, lnum, col, off]
		"bufnum" is zero, unless a mark like '0 or 'A is used, then it
		is the buffer number of the mark.
		"lnum" and "col" are the position in the buffer.  The first
		column is 1.
		The "off" number is zero, unless 'virtualedit' is used.  Then
		it is the offset in screen columns from the start of the
		character.  E.g., a position within a <Tab> or after the last
		character.
		Note that for '< and '> Visual mode matters: when it is "V"
		(visual line mode) the column of '< is zero and the column of
		'> is a large number.
		This can be used to save and restore the position of a mark: >
			let save_a_mark = getpos("'a")
			...
			call setpos(''a', save_a_mark
<		Also see |getcurpos()| and |setpos()|.


getqflist()						*getqflist()*
		Returns a list with all the current quickfix errors.  Each
		list item is a dictionary with these entries:
			bufnr	number of buffer that has the file name, use
				bufname() to get the name
			lnum	line number in the buffer (first line is 1)
			col	column number (first column is 1)
			vcol	non-zero: "col" is visual column
				zero: "col" is byte index
			nr	error number
			pattern	search pattern used to locate the error
			text	description of the error
			type	type of the error, 'E', '1', etc.
			valid	non-zero: recognized error message

		When there is no error list or it's empty an empty list is
		returned. Quickfix list entries with non-existing buffer
		number are returned with "bufnr" set to zero.

		Useful application: Find pattern matches in multiple files and
		do something with them: >
			:vimgrep /theword/jg *.c
			:for d in getqflist()
			:   echo bufname(d.bufnr) ':' d.lnum '=' d.text
			:endfor


getreg([{regname} [, 1 [, {list}]]])			*getreg()*
		The result is a String, which is the contents of register
		{regname}.  Example: >
			:let cliptext = getreg('*')
<		getreg('=') returns the last evaluated value of the expression
		register.  (For use in maps.)
		getreg('=', 1) returns the expression itself, so that it can
		be restored with |setreg()|.  For other registers the extra
		argument is ignored, thus you can always give it.
		If {list} is present and non-zero result type is changed to 
		|List|. Each list item is one text line. Use it if you care
		about zero bytes possibly present inside register: without
		third argument both NLs and zero bytes are represented as NLs
		(see |NL-used-for-Nul|).
		If {regname} is not specified, |v:register| is used.


getregtype([{regname}])					*getregtype()*
		The result is a String, which is type of register {regname}.
		The value will be one of:
		    "v"			for |characterwise| text
		    "V"			for |linewise| text
		    "<CTRL-V>{width}"	for |blockwise-visual| text
		    ""			for an empty or unknown register
		<CTRL-V> is one character with value 0x16.
		If {regname} is not specified, |v:register| is used.

gettabvar({tabnr}, {varname} [, {def}])				*gettabvar()*
		Get the value of a tab-local variable {varname} in tab page
		{tabnr}. |t:var|
		Tabs are numbered starting with one.
		When {varname} is empty a dictionary with all tab-local
		variables is returned.
		Note that the name without "t:" must be used.
		When the tab or variable doesn't exist {def} or an empty
		string is returned, there is no error message.

gettabwinvar({tabnr}, {winnr}, {varname} [, {def}])		*gettabwinvar()*
		Get the value of window-local variable {varname} in window
		{winnr} in tab page {tabnr}.
		When {varname} starts with "&" get the value of a window-local
		option.
		When {varname} is empty a dictionary with all window-local
		variables is returned.
		Note that {varname} must be the name without "w:".
		Tabs are numbered starting with one.  For the current tabpage
		use |getwinvar()|.
		When {winnr} is zero the current window is used.
		This also works for a global option, buffer-local option and
		window-local option, but it doesn't work for a global variable
		or buffer-local variable.
		When the tab, window or variable doesn't exist {def} or an
		empty string is returned, there is no error message.
		Examples: >
			:let list_is_on = gettabwinvar(1, 2, '&list')
			:echo "myvar = " . gettabwinvar(3, 1, 'myvar')
<
							*getwinposx()*
getwinposx()	The result is a Number, which is the X coordinate in pixels of
		the left hand side of the GUI Vim window.  The result will be
		-1 if the information is not available.

							*getwinposy()*
getwinposy()	The result is a Number, which is the Y coordinate in pixels of
		the top of the GUI Vim window.	The result will be -1 if the
		information is not available.

getwinvar({winnr}, {varname} [, {def}])				*getwinvar()*
		Like |gettabwinvar()| for the current tabpage.
		Examples: >
			:let list_is_on = getwinvar(2, '&list')
			:echo "myvar = " . getwinvar(1, 'myvar')
<
glob({expr} [, {nosuf} [, {list}]])				*glob()*
		Expand the file wildcards in {expr}.  See |wildcards| for the
		use of special characters.

		Unless the optional {nosuf} argument is given and is non-zero,
		the 'suffixes' and 'wildignore' options apply: Names matching
		one of the patterns in 'wildignore' will be skipped and
		'suffixes' affect the ordering of matches.
		'wildignorecase' always applies.

		When {list} is present and it is non-zero the result is a List
		with all matching files. The advantage of using a List is,
		you also get filenames containing newlines correctly.
		Otherwise the result is a String and when there are several
		matches, they are separated by <NL> characters.

		If the expansion fails, the result is an empty String or List.
		A name for a non-existing file is not included.  A symbolic
		link is only included if it points to an existing file.

		For most systems backticks can be used to get files names from
		any external command.  Example: >
			:let tagfiles = glob("`find . -name tags -print`")
			:let &tags = substitute(tagfiles, "\n", ",", "g")
<		The result of the program inside the backticks should be one
		item per line.	Spaces inside an item are allowed.

		See |expand()| for expanding special Vim variables.  See
		|system()| for getting the raw output of an external command.

globpath({path}, {expr} [, {nosuf} [, {list}]])			*globpath()*
		Perform glob() on all directories in {path} and concatenate
		the results.  Example: >
			:echo globpath(&rtp, "syntax/c.vim")
<
		{path} is a comma-separated list of directory names.  Each
		directory name is prepended to {expr} and expanded like with
		|glob()|.  A path separator is inserted when needed.
		To add a comma inside a directory name escape it with a
		backslash.  Note that on MS-Windows a directory may have a
		trailing backslash, remove it if you put a comma after it.
		If the expansion fails for one of the directories, there is no
		error message.

		Unless the optional {nosuf} argument is given and is non-zero,
		the 'suffixes' and 'wildignore' options apply: Names matching
		one of the patterns in 'wildignore' will be skipped and
		'suffixes' affect the ordering of matches.

		When {list} is present and it is non-zero the result is a List
		with all matching files. The advantage of using a List is, you
		also get filenames containing newlines correctly. Otherwise
		the result is a String and when there are several matches,
		they are separated by <NL> characters.  Example: >
			:echo globpath(&rtp, "syntax/c.vim", 0, 1)
<
		The "**" item can be used to search in a directory tree.
		For example, to find all "README.txt" files in the directories
		in 'runtimepath' and below: >
			:echo globpath(&rtp, "**/README.txt")
<		Upwards search and limiting the depth of "**" is not
		supported, thus using 'path' will not always work properly.

							*has()*
has({feature})	The result is a Number, which is 1 if the feature {feature} is
		supported, zero otherwise.  The {feature} argument is a
		string.  See |feature-list| below.
		Also see |exists()|.


has_key({dict}, {key})					*has_key()*
		The result is a Number, which is 1 if |Dictionary| {dict} has
		an entry with key {key}.  Zero otherwise.

haslocaldir()						*haslocaldir()*
		The result is a Number, which is 1 when the current
		window has set a local path via |:lcd|, and 0 otherwise.

hasmapto({what} [, {mode} [, {abbr}]])			*hasmapto()*
		The result is a Number, which is 1 if there is a mapping that
		contains {what} in somewhere in the rhs (what it is mapped to)
		and this mapping exists in one of the modes indicated by
		{mode}.
		When {abbr} is there and it is non-zero use abbreviations
		instead of mappings.  Don't forget to specify Insert and/or
		Command-line mode.
		Both the global mappings and the mappings local to the current
		buffer are checked for a match.
		If no matching mapping is found 0 is returned.
		The following characters are recognized in {mode}:
			n	Normal mode
			v	Visual mode
			o	Operator-pending mode
			i	Insert mode
			l	Language-Argument ("r", "f", "t", etc.)
			c	Command-line mode
		When {mode} is omitted, "nvo" is used.

		This function is useful to check if a mapping already exists
		to a function in a Vim script.	Example: >
			:if !hasmapto('\ABCdoit')
			:   map <Leader>d \ABCdoit
			:endif
<		This installs the mapping to "\ABCdoit" only if there isn't
		already a mapping to "\ABCdoit".

histadd({history}, {item})				*histadd()*
		Add the String {item} to the history {history} which can be
		one of:					*hist-names*
			"cmd"	 or ":"	  command line history
			"search" or "/"   search pattern history
			"expr"	 or "="   typed expression history
			"input"  or "@"	  input line history
			"debug"  or ">"   debug command history
		The {history} string does not need to be the whole name, one
		character is sufficient.
		If {item} does already exist in the history, it will be
		shifted to become the newest entry.
		The result is a Number: 1 if the operation was successful,
		otherwise 0 is returned.

		Example: >
			:call histadd("input", strftime("%Y %b %d"))
			:let date=input("Enter date: ")
<		This function is not available in the |sandbox|.

histdel({history} [, {item}])				*histdel()*
		Clear {history}, i.e. delete all its entries.  See |hist-names|
		for the possible values of {history}.

		If the parameter {item} evaluates to a String, it is used as a
		regular expression.  All entries matching that expression will
		be removed from the history (if there are any).
		Upper/lowercase must match, unless "\c" is used |/\c|.
		If {item} evaluates to a Number, it will be interpreted as
		an index, see |:history-indexing|.  The respective entry will
		be removed if it exists.

		The result is a Number: 1 for a successful operation,
		otherwise 0 is returned.

		Examples:
		Clear expression register history: >
			:call histdel("expr")
<
		Remove all entries starting with "*" from the search history: >
			:call histdel("/", '^\*')
<
		The following three are equivalent: >
			:call histdel("search", histnr("search"))
			:call histdel("search", -1)
			:call histdel("search", '^'.histget("search", -1).'$')
<
		To delete the last search pattern and use the last-but-one for
		the "n" command and 'hlsearch': >
			:call histdel("search", -1)
			:let @/ = histget("search", -1)

histget({history} [, {index}])				*histget()*
		The result is a String, the entry with Number {index} from
		{history}.  See |hist-names| for the possible values of
		{history}, and |:history-indexing| for {index}.  If there is
		no such entry, an empty String is returned.  When {index} is
		omitted, the most recent item from the history is used.

		Examples:
		Redo the second last search from history. >
			:execute '/' . histget("search", -2)

<		Define an Ex command ":H {num}" that supports re-execution of
		the {num}th entry from the output of |:history|. >
			:command -nargs=1 H execute histget("cmd", 0+<args>)
<
histnr({history})					*histnr()*
		The result is the Number of the current entry in {history}.
		See |hist-names| for the possible values of {history}.
		If an error occurred, -1 is returned.

		Example: >
			:let inp_index = histnr("expr")
<
hlexists({name})					*hlexists()*
		The result is a Number, which is non-zero if a highlight group
		called {name} exists.  This is when the group has been
		defined in some way.  Not necessarily when highlighting has
		been defined for it, it may also have been used for a syntax
		item.
							*highlight_exists()*
		Obsolete name: highlight_exists().

							*hlID()*
hlID({name})	The result is a Number, which is the ID of the highlight group
		with name {name}.  When the highlight group doesn't exist,
		zero is returned.
		This can be used to retrieve information about the highlight
		group.	For example, to get the background color of the
		"Comment" group: >
	:echo synIDattr(synIDtrans(hlID("Comment")), "bg")
<							*highlightID()*
		Obsolete name: highlightID().

hostname()						*hostname()*
		The result is a String, which is the name of the machine on
		which Vim is currently running.  Machine names greater than
		256 characters long are truncated.

iconv({expr}, {from}, {to})				*iconv()*
		The result is a String, which is the text {expr} converted
		from encoding {from} to encoding {to}.
		When the conversion completely fails an empty string is
		returned.  When some characters could not be converted they
		are replaced with "?".
		The encoding names are whatever the iconv() library function
		can accept, see ":!man 3 iconv".
		Most conversions require Vim to be compiled with the |+iconv|
		feature.  Otherwise only UTF-8 to latin1 conversion and back
		can be done.
		This can be used to display messages with special characters,
		no matter what 'encoding' is set to.  Write the message in
		UTF-8 and use: >
			echo iconv(utf8_str, "utf-8", &enc)
<		Note that Vim uses UTF-8 for all Unicode encodings, conversion
		from/to UCS-2 is automatically changed to use UTF-8.  You
		cannot use UCS-2 in a string anyway, because of the NUL bytes.
		{only available when compiled with the |+multi_byte| feature}

							*indent()*
indent({lnum})	The result is a Number, which is indent of line {lnum} in the
		current buffer.  The indent is counted in spaces, the value
		of 'tabstop' is relevant.  {lnum} is used just like in
		|getline()|.
		When {lnum} is invalid -1 is returned.


index({list}, {expr} [, {start} [, {ic}]])			*index()*
		Return the lowest index in |List| {list} where the item has a
		value equal to {expr}.  There is no automatic conversion, so
		the String "4" is different from the Number 4.  And the number
		4 is different from the Float 4.0.  The value of 'ignorecase'
		is not used here, case always matters.
		If {start} is given then start looking at the item with index
		{start} (may be negative for an item relative to the end).
		When {ic} is given and it is non-zero, ignore case.  Otherwise
		case must match.
		-1 is returned when {expr} is not found in {list}.
		Example: >
			:let idx = index(words, "the")
			:if index(numbers, 123) >= 0


input({prompt} [, {text} [, {completion}]])		*input()*
		The result is a String, which is whatever the user typed on
		the command-line.  The {prompt} argument is either a prompt
		string, or a blank string (for no prompt).  A '\n' can be used
		in the prompt to start a new line.
		The highlighting set with |:echohl| is used for the prompt.
		The input is entered just like a command-line, with the same
		editing commands and mappings.	There is a separate history
		for lines typed for input().
		Example: >
			:if input("Coffee or beer? ") == "beer"
			:  echo "Cheers!"
			:endif
<
		If the optional {text} argument is present and not empty, this
		is used for the default reply, as if the user typed this.
		Example: >
			:let color = input("Color? ", "white")

<		The optional {completion} argument specifies the type of
		completion supported for the input.  Without it completion is
		not performed.	The supported completion types are the same as
		that can be supplied to a user-defined command using the
		"-complete=" argument.	Refer to |:command-completion| for
		more information.  Example: >
			let fname = input("File: ", "", "file")
<
		NOTE: This function must not be used in a startup file, for
		the versions that only run in GUI mode (e.g., the Win32 GUI).
		Note: When input() is called from within a mapping it will
		consume remaining characters from that mapping, because a
		mapping is handled like the characters were typed.
		Use |inputsave()| before input() and |inputrestore()|
		after input() to avoid that.  Another solution is to avoid
		that further characters follow in the mapping, e.g., by using
		|:execute| or |:normal|.

		Example with a mapping: >
			:nmap \x :call GetFoo()<CR>:exe "/" . Foo<CR>
			:function GetFoo()
			:  call inputsave()
			:  let g:Foo = input("enter search pattern: ")
			:  call inputrestore()
			:endfunction

inputdialog({prompt} [, {text} [, {cancelreturn}]])		*inputdialog()*
		Like |input()|, but when the GUI is running and text dialogs
		are supported, a dialog window pops up to input the text.
		Example: >
		   :let n = inputdialog("value for shiftwidth", shiftwidth())
		   :if n != ""
		   :  let &sw = n
		   :endif
<		When the dialog is cancelled {cancelreturn} is returned.  When
		omitted an empty string is returned.
		Hitting <Enter> works like pressing the OK button.  Hitting
		<Esc> works like pressing the Cancel button.
		NOTE: Command-line completion is not supported.

inputlist({textlist})					*inputlist()*
		{textlist} must be a |List| of strings.  This |List| is
		displayed, one string per line.  The user will be prompted to
		enter a number, which is returned.
		The user can also select an item by clicking on it with the
		mouse.	For the first string 0 is returned.  When clicking
		above the first item a negative number is returned.  When
		clicking on the prompt one more than the length of {textlist}
		is returned.
		Make sure {textlist} has less than 'lines' entries, otherwise
		it won't work.	It's a good idea to put the entry number at
		the start of the string.  And put a prompt in the first item.
		Example: >
			let color = inputlist(['Select color:', '1. red',
				\ '2. green', '3. blue'])

inputrestore()						*inputrestore()*
		Restore typeahead that was saved with a previous |inputsave()|.
		Should be called the same number of times inputsave() is
		called.  Calling it more often is harmless though.
		Returns 1 when there is nothing to restore, 0 otherwise.

inputsave()						*inputsave()*
		Preserve typeahead (also from mappings) and clear it, so that
		a following prompt gets input from the user.  Should be
		followed by a matching inputrestore() after the prompt.  Can
		be used several times, in which case there must be just as
		many inputrestore() calls.
		Returns 1 when out of memory, 0 otherwise.

inputsecret({prompt} [, {text}])			*inputsecret()*
		This function acts much like the |input()| function with but
		two exceptions:
		a) the user's response will be displayed as a sequence of
		asterisks ("*") thereby keeping the entry secret, and
		b) the user's response will not be recorded on the input
		|history| stack.
		The result is a String, which is whatever the user actually
		typed on the command-line in response to the issued prompt.
		NOTE: Command-line completion is not supported.

insert({list}, {item} [, {idx}])			*insert()*
		Insert {item} at the start of |List| {list}.
		If {idx} is specified insert {item} before the item with index
		{idx}.	If {idx} is zero it goes before the first item, just
		like omitting {idx}.  A negative {idx} is also possible, see
		|list-index|.  -1 inserts just before the last item.
		Returns the resulting |List|.  Examples: >
			:let mylist = insert([2, 3, 5], 1)
			:call insert(mylist, 4, -1)
			:call insert(mylist, 6, len(mylist))
<		The last example can be done simpler with |add()|.
		Note that when {item} is a |List| it is inserted as a single
		item.  Use |extend()| to concatenate |Lists|.

invert({expr})						*invert()*
		Bitwise invert.  The argument is converted to a number.  A
		List, Dict or Float argument causes an error.  Example: >
			:let bits = invert(bits)

isdirectory({directory})				*isdirectory()*
		The result is a Number, which is non-zero when a directory
		with the name {directory} exists.  If {directory} doesn't
		exist, or isn't a directory, the result is FALSE.  {directory}
		is any expression, which is used as a String.

islocked({expr})					*islocked()* *E786*
		The result is a Number, which is non-zero when {expr} is the
		name of a locked variable.
		{expr} must be the name of a variable, |List| item or
		|Dictionary| entry, not the variable itself!  Example: >
			:let alist = [0, ['a', 'b'], 2, 3]
			:lockvar 1 alist
			:echo islocked('alist')		" 1
			:echo islocked('alist[1]')	" 0

<		When {expr} is a variable that does not exist you get an error
		message.  Use |exists()| to check for existence.

items({dict})						*items()*
		Return a |List| with all the key-value pairs of {dict}.  Each
		|List| item is a list with two items: the key of a {dict}
		entry and the value of this entry.  The |List| is in arbitrary
		order.


join({list} [, {sep}])					*join()*
		Join the items in {list} together into one String.
		When {sep} is specified it is put in between the items.  If
		{sep} is omitted a single space is used.
		Note that {sep} is not added at the end.  You might want to
		add it there too: >
			let lines = join(mylist, "\n") . "\n"
<		String items are used as-is.  |Lists| and |Dictionaries| are
		converted into a string like with |string()|.
		The opposite function is |split()|.

keys({dict})						*keys()*
		Return a |List| with all the keys of {dict}.  The |List| is in
		arbitrary order.

							*len()* *E701*
len({expr})	The result is a Number, which is the length of the argument.
		When {expr} is a String or a Number the length in bytes is
		used, as with |strlen()|.
		When {expr} is a |List| the number of items in the |List| is
		returned.
		When {expr} is a |Dictionary| the number of entries in the
		|Dictionary| is returned.
		Otherwise an error is given.

						*libcall()* *E364* *E368*
libcall({libname}, {funcname}, {argument})
		Call function {funcname} in the run-time library {libname}
		with single argument {argument}.
		This is useful to call functions in a library that you
		especially made to be used with Vim.  Since only one argument
		is possible, calling standard library functions is rather
		limited.
		The result is the String returned by the function.  If the
		function returns NULL, this will appear as an empty string ""
		to Vim.
		If the function returns a number, use libcallnr()!
		If {argument} is a number, it is passed to the function as an
		int; if {argument} is a string, it is passed as a
		null-terminated string.
		This function will fail in |restricted-mode|.

		libcall() allows you to write your own 'plug-in' extensions to
		Vim without having to recompile the program.  It is NOT a
		means to call system functions!  If you try to do so Vim will
		very probably crash.

		For Win32, the functions you write must be placed in a DLL
		and use the normal C calling convention (NOT Pascal which is
		used in Windows System DLLs).  The function must take exactly
		one parameter, either a character pointer or a long integer,
		and must return a character pointer or NULL.  The character
		pointer returned must point to memory that will remain valid
		after the function has returned (e.g. in static data in the
		DLL).  If it points to allocated memory, that memory will
		leak away.  Using a static buffer in the function should work,
		it's then freed when the DLL is unloaded.

		WARNING: If the function returns a non-valid pointer, Vim may
		crash!	This also happens if the function returns a number,
		because Vim thinks it's a pointer.
		For Win32 systems, {libname} should be the filename of the DLL
		without the ".DLL" suffix.  A full path is only required if
		the DLL is not in the usual places.
		For Unix: When compiling your own plugins, remember that the
		object code must be compiled as position-independent ('PIC').
		{only in Win32 and some Unix versions, when the |+libcall|
		feature is present}
		Examples: >
			:echo libcall("libc.so", "getenv", "HOME")
<
							*libcallnr()*
libcallnr({libname}, {funcname}, {argument})
		Just like |libcall()|, but used for a function that returns an
		int instead of a string.
		{only in Win32 on some Unix versions, when the |+libcall|
		feature is present}
		Examples: >
			:echo libcallnr("/usr/lib/libc.so", "getpid", "")
			:call libcallnr("libc.so", "printf", "Hello World!\n")
			:call libcallnr("libc.so", "sleep", 10)
<
							*line()*
line({expr})	The result is a Number, which is the line number of the file
		position given with {expr}.  The accepted positions are:
		    .	    the cursor position
		    $	    the last line in the current buffer
		    'x	    position of mark x (if the mark is not set, 0 is
			    returned)
		    w0	    first line visible in current window
		    w$	    last line visible in current window
		    v	    In Visual mode: the start of the Visual area (the
			    cursor is the end).  When not in Visual mode
			    returns the cursor position.  Differs from |'<| in
			    that it's updated right away.
		Note that a mark in another file can be used.  The line number
		then applies to another buffer.
		To get the column number use |col()|.  To get both use
		|getpos()|.
		Examples: >
			line(".")		line number of the cursor
			line("'t")		line number of mark t
			line("'" . marker)	line number of mark marker
<							*last-position-jump*
		This autocommand jumps to the last known position in a file
		just after opening it, if the '" mark is set: >
	:au BufReadPost * if line("'\"") > 1 && line("'\"") <= line("$") | exe "normal! g`\"" | endif

line2byte({lnum})					*line2byte()*
		Return the byte count from the start of the buffer for line
		{lnum}.  This includes the end-of-line character, depending on
		the 'fileformat' option for the current buffer.  The first
		line returns 1. 'encoding' matters, 'fileencoding' is ignored.
		This can also be used to get the byte count for the line just
		below the last line: >
			line2byte(line("$") + 1)
<		This is the buffer size plus one.  If 'fileencoding' is empty
		it is the file size plus one.
		When {lnum} is invalid, or the |+byte_offset| feature has been
		disabled at compile time, -1 is returned.
		Also see |byte2line()|, |go| and |:goto|.

lispindent({lnum})					*lispindent()*
		Get the amount of indent for line {lnum} according the lisp
		indenting rules, as with 'lisp'.
		The indent is counted in spaces, the value of 'tabstop' is
		relevant.  {lnum} is used just like in |getline()|.
		When {lnum} is invalid or Vim was not compiled the
		|+lispindent| feature, -1 is returned.

localtime()						*localtime()*
		Return the current time, measured as seconds since 1st Jan
		1970.  See also |strftime()| and |getftime()|.


log({expr})						*log()*
		Return the natural logarithm (base e) of {expr} as a |Float|.
		{expr} must evaluate to a |Float| or a |Number| in the range
		(0, inf].
		Examples: >
			:echo log(10)
<			2.302585 >
			:echo log(exp(5))
<			5.0
		{only available when compiled with the |+float| feature}


log10({expr})						*log10()*
		Return the logarithm of Float {expr} to base 10 as a |Float|.
		{expr} must evaluate to a |Float| or a |Number|.
		Examples: >
			:echo log10(1000)
<			3.0 >
			:echo log10(0.01)
<			-2.0
		{only available when compiled with the |+float| feature}
		
luaeval({expr}[, {expr}])					*luaeval()*
		Evaluate Lua expression {expr} and return its result converted 
		to Vim data structures. Second {expr} may hold additional 
		argument accessible as _A inside first {expr}.
		Strings are returned as they are.
		Boolean objects are converted to numbers.
		Numbers are converted to |Float| values if vim was compiled 
		with |+float| and to numbers otherwise.
		Dictionaries and lists obtained by vim.eval() are returned 
		as-is.
		Other objects are returned as zero without any errors.
		See |lua-luaeval| for more details.
		{only available when compiled with the |+lua| feature}

map({expr}, {string})					*map()*
		{expr} must be a |List| or a |Dictionary|.
		Replace each item in {expr} with the result of evaluating
		{string}.
		Inside {string} |v:val| has the value of the current item.
		For a |Dictionary| |v:key| has the key of the current item
		and for a |List| |v:key| has the index of the current item.
		Example: >
			:call map(mylist, '"> " . v:val . " <"')
<		This puts "> " before and " <" after each item in "mylist".

		Note that {string} is the result of an expression and is then
		used as an expression again.  Often it is good to use a
		|literal-string| to avoid having to double backslashes.  You
		still have to double ' quotes

		The operation is done in-place.  If you want a |List| or
		|Dictionary| to remain unmodified make a copy first: >
			:let tlist = map(copy(mylist), ' v:val . "\t"')

<		Returns {expr}, the |List| or |Dictionary| that was filtered.
		When an error is encountered while evaluating {string} no
		further items in {expr} are processed.


maparg({name}[, {mode} [, {abbr} [, {dict}]]])			*maparg()*
		When {dict} is omitted or zero: Return the rhs of mapping
		{name} in mode {mode}.  The returned String has special
		characters translated like in the output of the ":map" command
		listing.
		
		When there is no mapping for {name}, an empty String is
		returned.

		The {name} can have special key names, like in the ":map"
		command.

		{mode} can be one of these strings:
			"n"	Normal
			"v"	Visual (including Select)
			"o"	Operator-pending
			"i"	Insert
			"c"	Cmd-line
			"s"	Select
			"x"	Visual
			"l"	langmap |language-mapping|
			""	Normal, Visual and Operator-pending
		When {mode} is omitted, the modes for "" are used.

		When {abbr} is there and it is non-zero use abbreviations
		instead of mappings.

		When {dict} is there and it is non-zero return a dictionary
		containing all the information of the mapping with the
		following items:
		  "lhs"	     The {lhs} of the mapping.
		  "rhs"	     The {rhs} of the mapping as typed.
		  "silent"   1 for a |:map-silent| mapping, else 0.
		  "noremap"  1 if the {rhs} of the mapping is not remappable.
		  "expr"     1 for an expression mapping (|:map-<expr>|).
		  "buffer"   1 for a buffer local mapping (|:map-local|).
		  "mode"     Modes for which the mapping is defined. In
			     addition to the modes mentioned above, these
			     characters will be used:
			     " "     Normal, Visual and Operator-pending
			     "!"     Insert and Commandline mode
				     (|mapmode-ic|)
		  "sid"	     The script local ID, used for <sid> mappings
			     (|<SID>|).
		  "nowait"   Do not wait for other, longer mappings.
			     (|:map-<nowait>|).

		The mappings local to the current buffer are checked first,
		then the global mappings.
		This function can be used to map a key even when it's already
		mapped, and have it do the original mapping too.  Sketch: >
			exe 'nnoremap <Tab> ==' . maparg('<Tab>', 'n')


mapcheck({name}[, {mode} [, {abbr}]])			*mapcheck()*
		Check if there is a mapping that matches with {name} in mode
		{mode}.  See |maparg()| for {mode} and special names in
		{name}.
		When {abbr} is there and it is non-zero use abbreviations
		instead of mappings.
		A match happens with a mapping that starts with {name} and
		with a mapping which is equal to the start of {name}.

			matches mapping "a"	"ab"	"abc" ~
		   mapcheck("a")	yes	yes	 yes
		   mapcheck("abc")	yes	yes	 yes
		   mapcheck("ax")	yes	no	 no
		   mapcheck("b")	no	no	 no

		The difference with maparg() is that mapcheck() finds a
		mapping that matches with {name}, while maparg() only finds a
		mapping for {name} exactly.
		When there is no mapping that starts with {name}, an empty
		String is returned.  If there is one, the rhs of that mapping
		is returned.  If there are several mappings that start with
		{name}, the rhs of one of them is returned.
		The mappings local to the current buffer are checked first,
		then the global mappings.
		This function can be used to check if a mapping can be added
		without being ambiguous.  Example: >
	:if mapcheck("_vv") == ""
	:   map _vv :set guifont=7x13<CR>
	:endif
<		This avoids adding the "_vv" mapping when there already is a
		mapping for "_v" or for "_vvv".

match({expr}, {pat}[, {start}[, {count}]])			*match()*
		When {expr} is a |List| then this returns the index of the
		first item where {pat} matches.  Each item is used as a
		String, |Lists| and |Dictionaries| are used as echoed.
		Otherwise, {expr} is used as a String.	The result is a
		Number, which gives the index (byte offset) in {expr} where
		{pat} matches.
		A match at the first character or |List| item returns zero.
		If there is no match -1 is returned.
		For getting submatches see |matchlist()|.
		Example: >
			:echo match("testing", "ing")	" results in 4
			:echo match([1, 'x'], '\a')	" results in 1
<		See |string-match| for how {pat} is used.
								*strpbrk()*
		Vim doesn't have a strpbrk() function.	But you can do: >
			:let sepidx = match(line, '[.,;: \t]')
<								*strcasestr()*
		Vim doesn't have a strcasestr() function.  But you can add
		"\c" to the pattern to ignore case: >
			:let idx = match(haystack, '\cneedle')
<
		If {start} is given, the search starts from byte index
		{start} in a String or item {start} in a |List|.
		The result, however, is still the index counted from the
		first character/item.  Example: >
			:echo match("testing", "ing", 2)
<		result is again "4". >
			:echo match("testing", "ing", 4)
<		result is again "4". >
			:echo match("testing", "t", 2)
<		result is "3".
		For a String, if {start} > 0 then it is like the string starts
		{start} bytes later, thus "^" will match at {start}.  Except
		when {count} is given, then it's like matches before the
		{start} byte are ignored (this is a bit complicated to keep it
		backwards compatible).
		For a String, if {start} < 0, it will be set to 0.  For a list
		the index is counted from the end.
		If {start} is out of range ({start} > strlen({expr}) for a
		String or {start} > len({expr}) for a |List|) -1 is returned.

		When {count} is given use the {count}'th match.  When a match
		is found in a String the search for the next one starts one
		character further.  Thus this example results in 1: >
			echo match("testing", "..", 0, 2)
<		In a |List| the search continues in the next item.
		Note that when {count} is added the way {start} works changes,
		see above.

		See |pattern| for the patterns that are accepted.
		The 'ignorecase' option is used to set the ignore-caseness of
		the pattern.  'smartcase' is NOT used.	The matching is always
		done like 'magic' is set and 'cpoptions' is empty.

					*matchadd()* *E798* *E799* *E801*
matchadd({group}, {pattern}[, {priority}[, {id}]])
		Defines a pattern to be highlighted in the current window (a
		"match").  It will be highlighted with {group}.  Returns an
		identification number (ID), which can be used to delete the
		match using |matchdelete()|.
		Matching is case sensitive and magic, unless case sensitivity
		or magicness are explicitly overridden in {pattern}.  The
		'magic', 'smartcase' and 'ignorecase' options are not used.

		The optional {priority} argument assigns a priority to the
		match.	A match with a high priority will have its
		highlighting overrule that of a match with a lower priority.
		A priority is specified as an integer (negative numbers are no
		exception).  If the {priority} argument is not specified, the
		default priority is 10.  The priority of 'hlsearch' is zero,
		hence all matches with a priority greater than zero will
		overrule it.  Syntax highlighting (see 'syntax') is a separate
		mechanism, and regardless of the chosen priority a match will
		always overrule syntax highlighting.

		The optional {id} argument allows the request for a specific
		match ID.  If a specified ID is already taken, an error
		message will appear and the match will not be added.  An ID
		is specified as a positive integer (zero excluded).  IDs 1, 2
		and 3 are reserved for |:match|, |:2match| and |:3match|,
		respectively.  If the {id} argument is not specified,
		|matchadd()| automatically chooses a free ID.

		The number of matches is not limited, as it is the case with
		the |:match| commands.

		Example: >
			:highlight MyGroup ctermbg=green guibg=green
			:let m = matchadd("MyGroup", "TODO")
<		Deletion of the pattern: >
			:call matchdelete(m)

<		A list of matches defined by |matchadd()| and |:match| are
		available from |getmatches()|.	All matches can be deleted in
		one operation by |clearmatches()|.

matchaddpos({group}, {pos}[, {priority}[, {id}]])		*matchaddpos()*
		Same as |matchadd()|, but requires a list of positions {pos}
		instead of a pattern. This command is faster than |matchadd()|
		because it does not require to handle regular expressions and
		sets buffer line boundaries to redraw screen. It is supposed
		to be used when fast match additions and deletions are
		required, for example to highlight matching parentheses.

		The list {pos} can contain one of these items:
		- A number.  This whole line will be highlighted.  The first
		  line has number 1.
		- A list with one number, e.g., [23]. The whole line with this
		  number will be highlighted.
		- A list with two numbers, e.g., [23, 11]. The first number is
		  the line number, the second one is the column number (first
		  column is 1, the value must correspond to the byte index as
		  |col()| would return).  The character at this position will
		  be highlighted.
		- A list with three numbers, e.g., [23, 11, 3]. As above, but
		  the third number gives the length of the highlight in bytes.
		
		The maximum number of positions is 8.

		Example: >
			:highlight MyGroup ctermbg=green guibg=green
			:let m = matchaddpos("MyGroup", [[23, 24], 34])
<		Deletion of the pattern: >
			:call matchdelete(m)

<		Matches added by |matchaddpos()| are returned by
		|getmatches()| with an entry "pos1", "pos2", etc., with the
		value a list like the {pos} item.
		These matches cannot be set via |setmatches()|, however they
		can still be deleted by |clearmatches()|.

matcharg({nr})							*matcharg()*
		Selects the {nr} match item, as set with a |:match|,
		|:2match| or |:3match| command.
		Return a |List| with two elements:
			The name of the highlight group used
			The pattern used.
		When {nr} is not 1, 2 or 3 returns an empty |List|.
		When there is no match item set returns ['', ''].
		This is useful to save and restore a |:match|.
		Highlighting matches using the |:match| commands are limited
		to three matches. |matchadd()| does not have this limitation.

matchdelete({id})			       *matchdelete()* *E802* *E803*
		Deletes a match with ID {id} previously defined by |matchadd()|
		or one of the |:match| commands.  Returns 0 if successful,
		otherwise -1.  See example for |matchadd()|.  All matches can
		be deleted in one operation by |clearmatches()|.

matchend({expr}, {pat}[, {start}[, {count}]])			*matchend()*
		Same as |match()|, but return the index of first character
		after the match.  Example: >
			:echo matchend("testing", "ing")
<		results in "7".
							*strspn()* *strcspn()*
		Vim doesn't have a strspn() or strcspn() function, but you can
		do it with matchend(): >
			:let span = matchend(line, '[a-zA-Z]')
			:let span = matchend(line, '[^a-zA-Z]')
<		Except that -1 is returned when there are no matches.

		The {start}, if given, has the same meaning as for |match()|. >
			:echo matchend("testing", "ing", 2)
<		results in "7". >
			:echo matchend("testing", "ing", 5)
<		result is "-1".
		When {expr} is a |List| the result is equal to |match()|.

matchlist({expr}, {pat}[, {start}[, {count}]])			*matchlist()*
		Same as |match()|, but return a |List|.  The first item in the
		list is the matched string, same as what matchstr() would
		return.  Following items are submatches, like "\1", "\2", etc.
		in |:substitute|.  When an optional submatch didn't match an
		empty string is used.  Example: >
			echo matchlist('acd', '\(a\)\?\(b\)\?\(c\)\?\(.*\)')
<		Results in: ['acd', 'a', '', 'c', 'd', '', '', '', '', '']
		When there is no match an empty list is returned.

matchstr({expr}, {pat}[, {start}[, {count}]])			*matchstr()*
		Same as |match()|, but return the matched string.  Example: >
			:echo matchstr("testing", "ing")
<		results in "ing".
		When there is no match "" is returned.
		The {start}, if given, has the same meaning as for |match()|. >
			:echo matchstr("testing", "ing", 2)
<		results in "ing". >
			:echo matchstr("testing", "ing", 5)
<		result is "".
		When {expr} is a |List| then the matching item is returned.
		The type isn't changed, it's not necessarily a String.

							*max()*
max({list})	Return the maximum value of all items in {list}.
		If {list} is not a list or one of the items in {list} cannot
		be used as a Number this results in an error.
		An empty |List| results in zero.

							*min()*
min({list})	Return the minimum value of all items in {list}.
		If {list} is not a list or one of the items in {list} cannot
		be used as a Number this results in an error.
		An empty |List| results in zero.

							*mkdir()* *E739*
mkdir({name} [, {path} [, {prot}]])
		Create directory {name}.
		If {path} is "p" then intermediate directories are created as
		necessary.  Otherwise it must be "".
		If {prot} is given it is used to set the protection bits of
		the new directory.  The default is 0755 (rwxr-xr-x: r/w for
		the user readable for others).	Use 0700 to make it unreadable
		for others.  This is only used for the last part of {name}.
		Thus if you create /tmp/foo/bar then /tmp/foo will be created
		with 0755.
		Example: >
			:call mkdir($HOME . "/tmp/foo/bar", "p", 0700)
<		This function is not available in the |sandbox|.
		Not available on all systems.  To check use: >
			:if exists("*mkdir")
<
							*mode()*
mode([expr])	Return a string that indicates the current mode.
		If [expr] is supplied and it evaluates to a non-zero Number or
		a non-empty String (|non-zero-arg|), then the full mode is
		returned, otherwise only the first letter is returned.  Note
		that " " and "0" are also non-empty strings.

			n	Normal
			no	Operator-pending
			v	Visual by character
			V	Visual by line
			CTRL-V	Visual blockwise
			s	Select by character
			S	Select by line
			CTRL-S	Select blockwise
			i	Insert
			R	Replace |R|
			Rv	Virtual Replace |gR|
			c	Command-line
			cv	Vim Ex mode |gQ|
			ce	Normal Ex mode |Q|
			r	Hit-enter prompt
			rm	The -- more -- prompt
			r?	A |:confirm| query of some sort
			!	Shell or external command is executing
		This is useful in the 'statusline' option or when used
		with |remote_expr()| In most other places it always returns
		"c" or "n".
		Also see |visualmode()|.

mzeval({expr})							*mzeval()*
		Evaluate MzScheme expression {expr} and return its result
		converted to Vim data structures.
		Numbers and strings are returned as they are.
		Pairs (including lists and improper lists) and vectors are
		returned as Vim |Lists|.
		Hash tables are represented as Vim |Dictionary| type with keys
		converted to strings.
		All other types are converted to string with display function.
		Examples: >
		    :mz (define l (list 1 2 3))
		    :mz (define h (make-hash)) (hash-set! h "list" l)
		    :echo mzeval("l")
		    :echo mzeval("h")
<
		{only available when compiled with the |+mzscheme| feature}

nextnonblank({lnum})					*nextnonblank()*
		Return the line number of the first line at or below {lnum}
		that is not blank.  Example: >
			if getline(nextnonblank(1)) =~ "Java"
<		When {lnum} is invalid or there is no non-blank line at or
		below it, zero is returned.
		See also |prevnonblank()|.

nr2char({expr}[, {utf8}])				*nr2char()*
		Return a string with a single character, which has the number
		value {expr}.  Examples: >
			nr2char(64)		returns "@"
			nr2char(32)		returns " "
<		When {utf8} is omitted or zero, the current 'encoding' is used.
		Example for "utf-8": >
			nr2char(300)		returns I with bow character
<		With {utf8} set to 1, always return utf-8 characters.
		Note that a NUL character in the file is specified with
		nr2char(10), because NULs are represented with newline
		characters.  nr2char(0) is a real NUL and terminates the
		string, thus results in an empty string.

or({expr}, {expr})					*or()*
		Bitwise OR on the two arguments.  The arguments are converted
		to a number.  A List, Dict or Float argument causes an error.
		Example: >
			:let bits = or(bits, 0x80)


pathshorten({expr})					*pathshorten()*
		Shorten directory names in the path {expr} and return the
		result.  The tail, the file name, is kept as-is.  The other
		components in the path are reduced to single letters.  Leading
		'~' and '.' characters are kept.  Example: >
			:echo pathshorten('~/.vim/autoload/myfile.vim')
<			~/.v/a/myfile.vim ~
		It doesn't matter if the path exists or not.

pow({x}, {y})						*pow()*
		Return the power of {x} to the exponent {y} as a |Float|.
		{x} and {y} must evaluate to a |Float| or a |Number|.
		Examples: >
			:echo pow(3, 3)
<			27.0 >
			:echo pow(2, 16)
<			65536.0 >
			:echo pow(32, 0.20)
<			2.0
		{only available when compiled with the |+float| feature}
		
prevnonblank({lnum})					*prevnonblank()*
		Return the line number of the first line at or above {lnum}
		that is not blank.  Example: >
			let ind = indent(prevnonblank(v:lnum - 1))
<		When {lnum} is invalid or there is no non-blank line at or
		above it, zero is returned.
		Also see |nextnonblank()|.


printf({fmt}, {expr1} ...)				*printf()*
		Return a String with {fmt}, where "%" items are replaced by
		the formatted form of their respective arguments.  Example: >
			printf("%4d: E%d %.30s", lnum, errno, msg)
<		May result in:
			"  99: E42 asdfasdfasdfasdfasdfasdfasdfas" ~

		Often used items are:
		  %s	string
		  %6S	string right-aligned in 6 display cells
		  %6s	string right-aligned in 6 bytes
		  %.9s	string truncated to 9 bytes
		  %c	single byte
		  %d	decimal number
		  %5d	decimal number padded with spaces to 5 characters
		  %x	hex number
		  %04x	hex number padded with zeros to at least 4 characters
		  %X	hex number using upper case letters
		  %o	octal number
		  %f	floating point number in the form 123.456
		  %e	floating point number in the form 1.234e3
		  %E	floating point number in the form 1.234E3
		  %g	floating point number, as %f or %e depending on value
		  %G	floating point number, as %f or %E depending on value
		  %%	the % character itself

		Conversion specifications start with '%' and end with the
		conversion type.  All other characters are copied unchanged to
		the result.

		The "%" starts a conversion specification.  The following
		arguments appear in sequence:

			%  [flags]  [field-width]  [.precision]  type

		flags
			Zero or more of the following flags:

		    #	      The value should be converted to an "alternate
			      form".  For c, d, and s conversions, this option
			      has no effect.  For o conversions, the precision
			      of the number is increased to force the first
			      character of the output string to a zero (except
			      if a zero value is printed with an explicit
			      precision of zero).
			      For x and X conversions, a non-zero result has
			      the string "0x" (or "0X" for X conversions)
			      prepended to it.

		    0 (zero)  Zero padding.  For all conversions the converted
			      value is padded on the left with zeros rather
			      than blanks.  If a precision is given with a
			      numeric conversion (d, o, x, and X), the 0 flag
			      is ignored.

		    -	      A negative field width flag; the converted value
			      is to be left adjusted on the field boundary.
			      The converted value is padded on the right with
			      blanks, rather than on the left with blanks or
			      zeros.  A - overrides a 0 if both are given.

		    ' ' (space)  A blank should be left before a positive
			      number produced by a signed conversion (d).

		    +	      A sign must always be placed before a number
			      produced by a signed conversion.	A + overrides
			      a space if both are used.

		field-width
			An optional decimal digit string specifying a minimum
			field width.  If the converted value has fewer bytes
			than the field width, it will be padded with spaces on
			the left (or right, if the left-adjustment flag has
			been given) to fill out the field width.

		.precision
			An optional precision, in the form of a period '.'
			followed by an optional digit string.  If the digit
			string is omitted, the precision is taken as zero.
			This gives the minimum number of digits to appear for
			d, o, x, and X conversions, or the maximum number of
			bytes to be printed from a string for s conversions.
			For floating point it is the number of digits after
			the decimal point.

		type
			A character that specifies the type of conversion to
			be applied, see below.

		A field width or precision, or both, may be indicated by an
		asterisk '*' instead of a digit string.  In this case, a
		Number argument supplies the field width or precision.	A
		negative field width is treated as a left adjustment flag
		followed by a positive field width; a negative precision is
		treated as though it were missing.  Example: >
			:echo printf("%d: %.*s", nr, width, line)
<		This limits the length of the text used from "line" to
		"width" bytes.

		The conversion specifiers and their meanings are:

				*printf-d* *printf-o* *printf-x* *printf-X*
		doxX	The Number argument is converted to signed decimal
			(d), unsigned octal (o), or unsigned hexadecimal (x
			and X) notation.  The letters "abcdef" are used for
			x conversions; the letters "ABCDEF" are used for X
			conversions.
			The precision, if any, gives the minimum number of
			digits that must appear; if the converted value
			requires fewer digits, it is padded on the left with
			zeros.
			In no case does a non-existent or small field width
			cause truncation of a numeric field; if the result of
			a conversion is wider than the field width, the field
			is expanded to contain the conversion result.

							*printf-c*
		c	The Number argument is converted to a byte, and the
			resulting character is written.

							*printf-s*
		s	The text of the String argument is used.  If a
			precision is specified, no more bytes than the number
			specified are used.
		S	The text of the String argument is used.  If a
			precision is specified, no more display cells than the
			number specified are used.  Without the |+multi_byte|
			feature works just like 's'.

							*printf-f* *E807*
		f	The Float argument is converted into a string of the 
			form 123.456.  The precision specifies the number of
			digits after the decimal point.  When the precision is
			zero the decimal point is omitted.  When the precision
			is not specified 6 is used.  A really big number
			(out of range or dividing by zero) results in "inf".
			"0.0 / 0.0" results in "nan".
			Example: >
				echo printf("%.2f", 12.115)
<				12.12
			Note that roundoff depends on the system libraries.
			Use |round()| when in doubt.

							*printf-e* *printf-E*
		e E	The Float argument is converted into a string of the
			form 1.234e+03 or 1.234E+03 when using 'E'.  The
			precision specifies the number of digits after the
			decimal point, like with 'f'.

							*printf-g* *printf-G*
		g G	The Float argument is converted like with 'f' if the
			value is between 0.001 (inclusive) and 10000000.0
			(exclusive).  Otherwise 'e' is used for 'g' and 'E'
			for 'G'.  When no precision is specified superfluous
			zeroes and '+' signs are removed, except for the zero
			immediately after the decimal point.  Thus 10000000.0
			results in 1.0e7.

							*printf-%*
		%	A '%' is written.  No argument is converted.  The
			complete conversion specification is "%%".

		When a Number argument is expected a String argument is also
		accepted and automatically converted.
		When a Float or String argument is expected a Number argument
		is also accepted and automatically converted.
		Any other argument type results in an error message.

							*E766* *E767*
		The number of {exprN} arguments must exactly match the number
		of "%" items.  If there are not sufficient or too many
		arguments an error is given.  Up to 18 arguments can be used.


pumvisible()						*pumvisible()*
		Returns non-zero when the popup menu is visible, zero
		otherwise.  See |ins-completion-menu|.
		This can be used to avoid some things that would remove the
		popup menu.

							*E860*
py3eval({expr})						*py3eval()*
		Evaluate Python expression {expr} and return its result
		converted to Vim data structures.
		Numbers and strings are returned as they are (strings are 
		copied though, unicode strings are additionally converted to 
		'encoding').
		Lists are represented as Vim |List| type.
		Dictionaries are represented as Vim |Dictionary| type with 
		keys converted to strings.
		{only available when compiled with the |+python3| feature}

							*E858* *E859*
pyeval({expr})						*pyeval()*
		Evaluate Python expression {expr} and return its result
		converted to Vim data structures.
		Numbers and strings are returned as they are (strings are 
		copied though).
		Lists are represented as Vim |List| type.
		Dictionaries are represented as Vim |Dictionary| type, 
		non-string keys result in error.
		{only available when compiled with the |+python| feature}

							*E726* *E727*
range({expr} [, {max} [, {stride}]])				*range()*
		Returns a |List| with Numbers:
		- If only {expr} is specified: [0, 1, ..., {expr} - 1]
		- If {max} is specified: [{expr}, {expr} + 1, ..., {max}]
		- If {stride} is specified: [{expr}, {expr} + {stride}, ...,
		  {max}] (increasing {expr} with {stride} each time, not
		  producing a value past {max}).
		When the maximum is one before the start the result is an
		empty list.  When the maximum is more than one before the
		start this is an error.
		Examples: >
			range(4)		" [0, 1, 2, 3]
			range(2, 4)		" [2, 3, 4]
			range(2, 9, 3)		" [2, 5, 8]
			range(2, -2, -1)	" [2, 1, 0, -1, -2]
			range(0)		" []
			range(2, 0)		" error!
<
							*readfile()*
readfile({fname} [, {binary} [, {max}]])
		Read file {fname} and return a |List|, each line of the file
		as an item.  Lines broken at NL characters.  Macintosh files
		separated with CR will result in a single long line (unless a
		NL appears somewhere).
		All NUL characters are replaced with a NL character.
		When {binary} is equal to "b" binary mode is used:
		- When the last line ends in a NL an extra empty list item is
		  added.
		- No CR characters are removed.
		Otherwise:
		- CR characters that appear before a NL are removed.
		- Whether the last line ends in a NL or not does not matter.
		- When 'encoding' is Unicode any UTF-8 byte order mark is
		  removed from the text.
		When {max} is given this specifies the maximum number of lines
		to be read.  Useful if you only want to check the first ten
		lines of a file: >
			:for line in readfile(fname, '', 10)
			:  if line =~ 'Date' | echo line | endif
			:endfor
<		When {max} is negative -{max} lines from the end of the file
		are returned, or as many as there are.
		When {max} is zero the result is an empty list.
		Note that without {max} the whole file is read into memory.
		Also note that there is no recognition of encoding.  Read a
		file into a buffer if you need to.
		When the file can't be opened an error message is given and
		the result is an empty list.
		Also see |writefile()|.

reltime([{start} [, {end}]])				*reltime()*
		Return an item that represents a time value.  The format of
		the item depends on the system.  It can be passed to
		|reltimestr()| to convert it to a string.
		Without an argument it returns the current time.
		With one argument is returns the time passed since the time
		specified in the argument.
		With two arguments it returns the time passed between {start}
		and {end}.
		The {start} and {end} arguments must be values returned by
		reltime().
		{only available when compiled with the |+reltime| feature}

reltimestr({time})				*reltimestr()*
		Return a String that represents the time value of {time}.
		This is the number of seconds, a dot and the number of
		microseconds.  Example: >
			let start = reltime()
			call MyFunction()
			echo reltimestr(reltime(start))
<		Note that overhead for the commands will be added to the time.
		The accuracy depends on the system.
		Leading spaces are used to make the string align nicely.  You
		can use split() to remove it. >
			echo split(reltimestr(reltime(start)))[0]
<		Also see |profiling|.
		{only available when compiled with the |+reltime| feature}

							*remote_expr()* *E449*
remote_expr({server}, {string} [, {idvar}])
		Send the {string} to {server}.	The string is sent as an
		expression and the result is returned after evaluation.
		The result must be a String or a |List|.  A |List| is turned
		into a String by joining the items with a line break in
		between (not at the end), like with join(expr, "\n").
		If {idvar} is present, it is taken as the name of a
		variable and a {serverid} for later use with
		remote_read() is stored there.
		See also |clientserver| |RemoteReply|.
		This function is not available in the |sandbox|.
		{only available when compiled with the |+clientserver| feature}
		Note: Any errors will cause a local error message to be issued
		and the result will be the empty string.
		Examples: >
			:echo remote_expr("gvim", "2+2")
			:echo remote_expr("gvim1", "b:current_syntax")
<

remote_foreground({server})				*remote_foreground()*
		Move the Vim server with the name {server} to the foreground.
		This works like: >
			remote_expr({server}, "foreground()")
<		Except that on Win32 systems the client does the work, to work
		around the problem that the OS doesn't always allow the server
		to bring itself to the foreground.
		Note: This does not restore the window if it was minimized,
		like foreground() does.
		This function is not available in the |sandbox|.
		{only in the Win32, Athena, Motif and GTK GUI versions and the
		Win32 console version}


remote_peek({serverid} [, {retvar}])		*remote_peek()*
		Returns a positive number if there are available strings
		from {serverid}.  Copies any reply string into the variable
		{retvar} if specified.	{retvar} must be a string with the
		name of a variable.
		Returns zero if none are available.
		Returns -1 if something is wrong.
		See also |clientserver|.
		This function is not available in the |sandbox|.
		{only available when compiled with the |+clientserver| feature}
		Examples: >
			:let repl = ""
			:echo "PEEK: ".remote_peek(id, "repl").": ".repl

remote_read({serverid})				*remote_read()*
		Return the oldest available reply from {serverid} and consume
		it.  It blocks until a reply is available.
		See also |clientserver|.
		This function is not available in the |sandbox|.
		{only available when compiled with the |+clientserver| feature}
		Example: >
			:echo remote_read(id)
<
							*remote_send()* *E241*
remote_send({server}, {string} [, {idvar}])
		Send the {string} to {server}.	The string is sent as input
		keys and the function returns immediately.  At the Vim server
		the keys are not mapped |:map|.
		If {idvar} is present, it is taken as the name of a variable
		and a {serverid} for later use with remote_read() is stored
		there.
		See also |clientserver| |RemoteReply|.
		This function is not available in the |sandbox|.
		{only available when compiled with the |+clientserver| feature}
		Note: Any errors will be reported in the server and may mess
		up the display.
		Examples: >
		:echo remote_send("gvim", ":DropAndReply ".file, "serverid").
		 \ remote_read(serverid)

		:autocmd NONE RemoteReply *
		 \ echo remote_read(expand("<amatch>"))
		:echo remote_send("gvim", ":sleep 10 | echo ".
		 \ 'server2client(expand("<client>"), "HELLO")<CR>')
<
remove({list}, {idx} [, {end}])				*remove()*
		Without {end}: Remove the item at {idx} from |List| {list} and
		return the item.
		With {end}: Remove items from {idx} to {end} (inclusive) and
		return a List with these items.  When {idx} points to the same
		item as {end} a list with one item is returned.  When {end}
		points to an item before {idx} this is an error.
		See |list-index| for possible values of {idx} and {end}.
		Example: >
			:echo "last item: " . remove(mylist, -1)
			:call remove(mylist, 0, 9)
remove({dict}, {key})
		Remove the entry from {dict} with key {key}.  Example: >
			:echo "removed " . remove(dict, "one")
<		If there is no {key} in {dict} this is an error.

		Use |delete()| to remove a file.

rename({from}, {to})					*rename()*
		Rename the file by the name {from} to the name {to}.  This
		should also work to move files across file systems.  The
		result is a Number, which is 0 if the file was renamed
		successfully, and non-zero when the renaming failed.
		NOTE: If {to} exists it is overwritten without warning.
		This function is not available in the |sandbox|.

repeat({expr}, {count})					*repeat()*
		Repeat {expr} {count} times and return the concatenated
		result.  Example: >
			:let separator = repeat('-', 80)
<		When {count} is zero or negative the result is empty.
		When {expr} is a |List| the result is {expr} concatenated
		{count} times.	Example: >
			:let longlist = repeat(['a', 'b'], 3)
<		Results in ['a', 'b', 'a', 'b', 'a', 'b'].


resolve({filename})					*resolve()* *E655*
		On MS-Windows, when {filename} is a shortcut (a .lnk file),
		returns the path the shortcut points to in a simplified form.
		On Unix, repeat resolving symbolic links in all path
		components of {filename} and return the simplified result.
		To cope with link cycles, resolving of symbolic links is
		stopped after 100 iterations.
		On other systems, return the simplified {filename}.
		The simplification step is done as by |simplify()|.
		resolve() keeps a leading path component specifying the
		current directory (provided the result is still a relative
		path name) and also keeps a trailing path separator.

							*reverse()*
reverse({list})	Reverse the order of items in {list} in-place.	Returns
		{list}.
		If you want a list to remain unmodified make a copy first: >
			:let revlist = reverse(copy(mylist))

round({expr})							*round()*
		Round off {expr} to the nearest integral value and return it
		as a |Float|.  If {expr} lies halfway between two integral
		values, then use the larger one (away from zero).
		{expr} must evaluate to a |Float| or a |Number|.
		Examples: >
			echo round(0.456)
<			0.0  >
			echo round(4.5)
<			5.0 >
			echo round(-4.5)
<			-5.0
		{only available when compiled with the |+float| feature}

screenattr(row, col)						*screenattr()*
		Like screenchar(), but return the attribute.  This is a rather
		arbitrary number that can only be used to compare to the
		attribute at other positions.

screenchar(row, col)						*screenchar()*
		The result is a Number, which is the character at position
		[row, col] on the screen.  This works for every possible
		screen position, also status lines, window separators and the
		command line.  The top left position is row one, column one
		The character excludes composing characters.  For double-byte
		encodings it may only be the first byte.
		This is mainly to be used for testing.
		Returns -1 when row or col is out of range.

screencol()							*screencol()*
		The result is a Number, which is the current screen column of
		the cursor. The leftmost column has number 1.
		This function is mainly used for testing.

		Note: Always returns the current screen column, thus if used
		in a command (e.g. ":echo screencol()") it will return the
		column inside the command line, which is 1 when the command is
		executed. To get the cursor position in the file use one of
		the following mappings: >
			nnoremap <expr> GG ":echom ".screencol()."\n"
			nnoremap <silent> GG :echom screencol()<CR>
<
screenrow()							*screenrow()*
		The result is a Number, which is the current screen row of the
		cursor.  The top line has number one.
		This function is mainly used for testing.

		Note: Same restrictions as with |screencol()|.

search({pattern} [, {flags} [, {stopline} [, {timeout}]]])	*search()*
		Search for regexp pattern {pattern}.  The search starts at the
		cursor position (you can use |cursor()| to set it).

		When a match has been found its line number is returned.
		If there is no match a 0 is returned and the cursor doesn't
		move.  No error message is given.

		{flags} is a String, which can contain these character flags:
		'b'	search backward instead of forward
		'c'	accept a match at the cursor position
		'e'	move to the End of the match
		'n'	do Not move the cursor
		'p'	return number of matching sub-pattern (see below)
		's'	set the ' mark at the previous location of the cursor
		'w'	wrap around the end of the file
		'W'	don't wrap around the end of the file
		If neither 'w' or 'W' is given, the 'wrapscan' option applies.

		If the 's' flag is supplied, the ' mark is set, only if the
		cursor is moved. The 's' flag cannot be combined with the 'n'
		flag.

		'ignorecase', 'smartcase' and 'magic' are used.

		When the {stopline} argument is given then the search stops
		after searching this line.  This is useful to restrict the
		search to a range of lines.  Examples: >
			let match = search('(', 'b', line("w0"))
			let end = search('END', '', line("w$"))
<		When {stopline} is used and it is not zero this also implies
		that the search does not wrap around the end of the file.
		A zero value is equal to not giving the argument.

		When the {timeout} argument is given the search stops when
		more than this many milliseconds have passed.	Thus when
		{timeout} is 500 the search stops after half a second.
		The value must not be negative.  A zero value is like not
		giving the argument.
		{only available when compiled with the |+reltime| feature}

							*search()-sub-match*
		With the 'p' flag the returned value is one more than the
		first sub-match in \(\).  One if none of them matched but the
		whole pattern did match.
		To get the column number too use |searchpos()|.

		The cursor will be positioned at the match, unless the 'n'
		flag is used.

		Example (goes over all files in the argument list): >
		    :let n = 1
		    :while n <= argc()	    " loop over all files in arglist
		    :  exe "argument " . n
		    :  " start at the last char in the file and wrap for the
		    :  " first search to find match at start of file
		    :  normal G$
		    :  let flags = "w"
		    :  while search("foo", flags) > 0
		    :	 s/foo/bar/g
		    :	 let flags = "W"
		    :  endwhile
		    :  update		    " write the file if modified
		    :  let n = n + 1
		    :endwhile
<
		Example for using some flags: >
		    :echo search('\<if\|\(else\)\|\(endif\)', 'ncpe')
<		This will search for the keywords "if", "else", and "endif"
		under or after the cursor.  Because of the 'p' flag, it
		returns 1, 2, or 3 depending on which keyword is found, or 0
		if the search fails.  With the cursor on the first word of the
		line:
		    if (foo == 0) | let foo = foo + 1 | endif ~
		the function returns 1.  Without the 'c' flag, the function
		finds the "endif" and returns 3.  The same thing happens
		without the 'e' flag if the cursor is on the "f" of "if".
		The 'n' flag tells the function not to move the cursor.


searchdecl({name} [, {global} [, {thisblock}]])			*searchdecl()*
		Search for the declaration of {name}.

		With a non-zero {global} argument it works like |gD|, find
		first match in the file.  Otherwise it works like |gd|, find
		first match in the function.

		With a non-zero {thisblock} argument matches in a {} block
		that ends before the cursor position are ignored.  Avoids
		finding variable declarations only valid in another scope.

		Moves the cursor to the found match.
		Returns zero for success, non-zero for failure.
		Example: >
			if searchdecl('myvar') == 0
			   echo getline('.')
			endif
<
							*searchpair()*
searchpair({start}, {middle}, {end} [, {flags} [, {skip}
				[, {stopline} [, {timeout}]]]])
		Search for the match of a nested start-end pair.  This can be
		used to find the "endif" that matches an "if", while other
		if/endif pairs in between are ignored.
		The search starts at the cursor.  The default is to search
		forward, include 'b' in {flags} to search backward.
		If a match is found, the cursor is positioned at it and the
		line number is returned.  If no match is found 0 or -1 is
		returned and the cursor doesn't move.  No error message is
		given.

		{start}, {middle} and {end} are patterns, see |pattern|.  They
		must not contain \( \) pairs.  Use of \%( \) is allowed.  When
		{middle} is not empty, it is found when searching from either
		direction, but only when not in a nested start-end pair.  A
		typical use is: >
			searchpair('\<if\>', '\<else\>', '\<endif\>')
<		By leaving {middle} empty the "else" is skipped.

		{flags} 'b', 'c', 'n', 's', 'w' and 'W' are used like with
		|search()|.  Additionally:
		'r'	Repeat until no more matches found; will find the
			outer pair.  Implies the 'W' flag.
		'm'	Return number of matches instead of line number with
			the match; will be > 1 when 'r' is used.
		Note: it's nearly always a good idea to use the 'W' flag, to
		avoid wrapping around the end of the file.

		When a match for {start}, {middle} or {end} is found, the
		{skip} expression is evaluated with the cursor positioned on
		the start of the match.  It should return non-zero if this
		match is to be skipped.  E.g., because it is inside a comment
		or a string.
		When {skip} is omitted or empty, every match is accepted.
		When evaluating {skip} causes an error the search is aborted
		and -1 returned.

		For {stopline} and {timeout} see |search()|.

		The value of 'ignorecase' is used.  'magic' is ignored, the
		patterns are used like it's on.

		The search starts exactly at the cursor.  A match with
		{start}, {middle} or {end} at the next character, in the
		direction of searching, is the first one found.  Example: >
			if 1
			  if 2
			  endif 2
			endif 1
<		When starting at the "if 2", with the cursor on the "i", and
		searching forwards, the "endif 2" is found.  When starting on
		the character just before the "if 2", the "endif 1" will be
		found.	That's because the "if 2" will be found first, and
		then this is considered to be a nested if/endif from "if 2" to
		"endif 2".
		When searching backwards and {end} is more than one character,
		it may be useful to put "\zs" at the end of the pattern, so
		that when the cursor is inside a match with the end it finds
		the matching start.

		Example, to find the "endif" command in a Vim script: >

	:echo searchpair('\<if\>', '\<el\%[seif]\>', '\<en\%[dif]\>', 'W',
			\ 'getline(".") =~ "^\\s*\""')

<		The cursor must be at or after the "if" for which a match is
		to be found.  Note that single-quote strings are used to avoid
		having to double the backslashes.  The skip expression only
		catches comments at the start of a line, not after a command.
		Also, a word "en" or "if" halfway a line is considered a
		match.
		Another example, to search for the matching "{" of a "}": >

	:echo searchpair('{', '', '}', 'bW')

<		This works when the cursor is at or before the "}" for which a
		match is to be found.  To reject matches that syntax
		highlighting recognized as strings: >

	:echo searchpair('{', '', '}', 'bW',
	     \ 'synIDattr(synID(line("."), col("."), 0), "name") =~? "string"')
<
							*searchpairpos()*
searchpairpos({start}, {middle}, {end} [, {flags} [, {skip}
				[, {stopline} [, {timeout}]]]])
		Same as |searchpair()|, but returns a |List| with the line and
		column position of the match. The first element of the |List|
		is the line number and the second element is the byte index of
		the column position of the match.  If no match is found,
		returns [0, 0]. >

			:let [lnum,col] = searchpairpos('{', '', '}', 'n')
<
		See |match-parens| for a bigger and more useful example.

searchpos({pattern} [, {flags} [, {stopline} [, {timeout}]]])	*searchpos()*
		Same as |search()|, but returns a |List| with the line and
		column position of the match. The first element of the |List|
		is the line number and the second element is the byte index of
		the column position of the match. If no match is found,
		returns [0, 0].
		Example: >
	:let [lnum, col] = searchpos('mypattern', 'n')

<		When the 'p' flag is given then there is an extra item with
		the sub-pattern match number |search()-sub-match|.  Example: >
	:let [lnum, col, submatch] = searchpos('\(\l\)\|\(\u\)', 'np')
<		In this example "submatch" is 2 when a lowercase letter is
		found |/\l|, 3 when an uppercase letter is found |/\u|.

server2client( {clientid}, {string})			*server2client()*
		Send a reply string to {clientid}.  The most recent {clientid}
		that sent a string can be retrieved with expand("<client>").
		{only available when compiled with the |+clientserver| feature}
		Note:
		This id has to be stored before the next command can be
		received.  I.e. before returning from the received command and
		before calling any commands that waits for input.
		See also |clientserver|.
		Example: >
			:echo server2client(expand("<client>"), "HELLO")
<
serverlist()					*serverlist()*
		Return a list of available server names, one per line.
		When there are no servers or the information is not available
		an empty string is returned.  See also |clientserver|.
		{only available when compiled with the |+clientserver| feature}
		Example: >
			:echo serverlist()
<
setbufvar({expr}, {varname}, {val})			*setbufvar()*
		Set option or local variable {varname} in buffer {expr} to
		{val}.
		This also works for a global or local window option, but it
		doesn't work for a global or local window variable.
		For a local window option the global value is unchanged.
		For the use of {expr}, see |bufname()| above.
		Note that the variable name without "b:" must be used.
		Examples: >
			:call setbufvar(1, "&mod", 1)
			:call setbufvar("todo", "myvar", "foobar")
<		This function is not available in the |sandbox|.

setcmdpos({pos})					*setcmdpos()*
		Set the cursor position in the command line to byte position
		{pos}.	The first position is 1.
		Use |getcmdpos()| to obtain the current position.
		Only works while editing the command line, thus you must use
		|c_CTRL-\_e|, |c_CTRL-R_=| or |c_CTRL-R_CTRL-R| with '='.  For
		|c_CTRL-\_e| and |c_CTRL-R_CTRL-R| with '=' the position is
		set after the command line is set to the expression.  For
		|c_CTRL-R_=| it is set after evaluating the expression but
		before inserting the resulting text.
		When the number is too big the cursor is put at the end of the
		line.  A number smaller than one has undefined results.
		Returns 0 when successful, 1 when not editing the command
		line.

setline({lnum}, {text})					*setline()*
		Set line {lnum} of the current buffer to {text}.  To insert
		lines use |append()|.
		{lnum} is used like with |getline()|.
		When {lnum} is just below the last line the {text} will be
		added as a new line.
		If this succeeds, 0 is returned.  If this fails (most likely
		because {lnum} is invalid) 1 is returned.  Example: >
			:call setline(5, strftime("%c"))
<		When {text} is a |List| then line {lnum} and following lines
		will be set to the items in the list.  Example: >
			:call setline(5, ['aaa', 'bbb', 'ccc'])
<		This is equivalent to: >
			:for [n, l] in [[5, 'aaa'], [6, 'bbb'], [7, 'ccc']]
			:  call setline(n, l)
			:endfor
<		Note: The '[ and '] marks are not set.

setloclist({nr}, {list} [, {action}])			*setloclist()*
		Create or replace or add to the location list for window {nr}.
		When {nr} is zero the current window is used. For a location
		list window, the displayed location list is modified.  For an
		invalid window number {nr}, -1 is returned.
		Otherwise, same as |setqflist()|.
		Also see |location-list|.

setmatches({list})					*setmatches()*
		Restores a list of matches saved by |getmatches()|.  Returns 0
		if successful, otherwise -1.  All current matches are cleared
		before the list is restored.  See example for |getmatches()|.

							*setpos()*
setpos({expr}, {list})
		Set the position for {expr}.  Possible values:
			.	the cursor
			'x	mark x

		{list} must be a |List| with four or five numbers:
		    [bufnum, lnum, col, off]
		    [bufnum, lnum, col, off, curswant]

		"bufnum" is the buffer number.	Zero can be used for the
		current buffer.  Setting the cursor is only possible for
		the current buffer.  To set a mark in another buffer you can
		use the |bufnr()| function to turn a file name into a buffer
		number.
		Does not change the jumplist.

		"lnum" and "col" are the position in the buffer.  The first
		column is 1.  Use a zero "lnum" to delete a mark.  If "col" is
		smaller than 1 then 1 is used.

		The "off" number is only used when 'virtualedit' is set. Then
		it is the offset in screen columns from the start of the
		character.  E.g., a position within a <Tab> or after the last
		character.

		The "curswant" number is only used when setting the cursor
		position.  It sets the preferred column for when moving the
		cursor vertically.  When the "curswant" number is missing the
		preferred column is not set.  When it is present and setting a
		mark position it is not used.

		Note that for '< and '> changing the line number may result in
		the marks to be effectively be swapped, so that '< is always
		before '>.

		Returns 0 when the position could be set, -1 otherwise.
		An error message is given if {expr} is invalid.

		Also see |getpos()| and |getcurpos()|.

		This does not restore the preferred column for moving
		vertically; if you set the cursor position with this, |j| and
		|k| motions will jump to previous columns!  Use |cursor()| to
		also set the preferred column.  Also see the "curswant" key in
		|winrestview()|.


setqflist({list} [, {action}])				*setqflist()*
		Create or replace or add to the quickfix list using the items
		in {list}.  Each item in {list} is a dictionary.
		Non-dictionary items in {list} are ignored.  Each dictionary
		item can contain the following entries:

		    bufnr	buffer number; must be the number of a valid
				buffer
		    filename	name of a file; only used when "bufnr" is not
				present or it is invalid.
		    lnum	line number in the file
		    pattern	search pattern used to locate the error
		    col		column number
		    vcol	when non-zero: "col" is visual column
				when zero: "col" is byte index
		    nr		error number
		    text	description of the error
		    type	single-character error type, 'E', 'W', etc.

		The "col", "vcol", "nr", "type" and "text" entries are
		optional.  Either "lnum" or "pattern" entry can be used to
		locate a matching error line.
		If the "filename" and "bufnr" entries are not present or
		neither the "lnum" or "pattern" entries are present, then the
		item will not be handled as an error line.
		If both "pattern" and "lnum" are present then "pattern" will
		be used.
		If you supply an empty {list}, the quickfix list will be
		cleared.
		Note that the list is not exactly the same as what
		|getqflist()| returns.

		If {action} is set to 'a', then the items from {list} are
		added to the existing quickfix list. If there is no existing
		list, then a new list is created. If {action} is set to 'r',
		then the items from the current quickfix list are replaced
		with the items from {list}. If {action} is not present or is
		set to ' ', then a new list is created.

		Returns zero for success, -1 for failure.

		This function can be used to create a quickfix list
		independent of the 'errorformat' setting.  Use a command like
		":cc 1" to jump to the first position.


							*setreg()*
setreg({regname}, {value} [,{options}])
		Set the register {regname} to {value}.
		{value} may be any value returned by |getreg()|, including 
		a |List|.
		If {options} contains "a" or {regname} is upper case,
		then the value is appended.
		{options} can also contain a register type specification:
		    "c" or "v"	      |characterwise| mode
		    "l" or "V"	      |linewise| mode
		    "b" or "<CTRL-V>" |blockwise-visual| mode
		If a number immediately follows "b" or "<CTRL-V>" then this is
		used as the width of the selection - if it is not specified
		then the width of the block is set to the number of characters
		in the longest line (counting a <Tab> as 1 character).

		If {options} contains no register settings, then the default
		is to use character mode unless {value} ends in a <NL> for 
		string {value} and linewise mode for list {value}. Blockwise 
		mode is never selected automatically.
		Returns zero for success, non-zero for failure.

							*E883*
		Note: you may not use |List| containing more than one item to 
		      set search and expression registers. Lists containing no 
		      items act like empty strings.

		Examples: >
			:call setreg(v:register, @*)
			:call setreg('*', @%, 'ac')
			:call setreg('a', "1\n2\n3", 'b5')

<		This example shows using the functions to save and restore a
		register (note: you may not reliably restore register value 
		without using the third argument to |getreg()| as without it 
		newlines are represented as newlines AND Nul bytes are 
		represented as newlines as well, see |NL-used-for-Nul|). >
			:let var_a = getreg('a', 1, 1)
			:let var_amode = getregtype('a')
			    ....
			:call setreg('a', var_a, var_amode)

<		You can also change the type of a register by appending
		nothing: >
			:call setreg('a', '', 'al')

settabvar({tabnr}, {varname}, {val})			*settabvar()*
		Set tab-local variable {varname} to {val} in tab page {tabnr}.
		|t:var|
		Note that the variable name without "t:" must be used.
		Tabs are numbered starting with one.
		This function is not available in the |sandbox|.

settabwinvar({tabnr}, {winnr}, {varname}, {val})	*settabwinvar()*
		Set option or local variable {varname} in window {winnr} to
		{val}.
		Tabs are numbered starting with one.  For the current tabpage
		use |setwinvar()|.
		When {winnr} is zero the current window is used.
		This also works for a global or local buffer option, but it
		doesn't work for a global or local buffer variable.
		For a local buffer option the global value is unchanged.
		Note that the variable name without "w:" must be used.
		Examples: >
			:call settabwinvar(1, 1, "&list", 0)
			:call settabwinvar(3, 2, "myvar", "foobar")
<		This function is not available in the |sandbox|.

setwinvar({nr}, {varname}, {val})			*setwinvar()*
		Like |settabwinvar()| for the current tab page.
		Examples: >
			:call setwinvar(1, "&list", 0)
			:call setwinvar(2, "myvar", "foobar")

sha256({string})						*sha256()*
		Returns a String with 64 hex charactes, which is the SHA256
		checksum of {string}.
		{only available when compiled with the |+cryptv| feature}

shellescape({string} [, {special}])			*shellescape()*
		Escape {string} for use as a shell command argument.
		On MS-Windows and MS-DOS, when 'shellslash' is not set, it
		will enclose {string} in double quotes and double all double
		quotes within {string}.
		For other systems, it will enclose {string} in single quotes
		and replace all "'" with "'\''".
		When the {special} argument is present and it's a non-zero
		Number or a non-empty String (|non-zero-arg|), then special
		items such as "!", "%", "#" and "<cword>" will be preceded by
		a backslash.  This backslash will be removed again by the |:!|
		command.
		The "!" character will be escaped (again with a |non-zero-arg|
		{special}) when 'shell' contains "csh" in the tail.  That is
		because for csh and tcsh "!" is used for history replacement
		even when inside single quotes.
		The <NL> character is also escaped.  With a |non-zero-arg|
		{special} and 'shell' containing "csh" in the tail it's
		escaped a second time.
		Example of use with a |:!| command: >
		    :exe '!dir ' . shellescape(expand('<cfile>'), 1)
<		This results in a directory listing for the file under the
		cursor.  Example of use with |system()|: >
		    :call system("chmod +w -- " . shellescape(expand("%")))
<		See also |::S|.


shiftwidth()						*shiftwidth()*
		Returns the effective value of 'shiftwidth'. This is the
		'shiftwidth' value unless it is zero, in which case it is the
		'tabstop' value.  To be backwards compatible in indent
		plugins, use this: >
			if exists('*shiftwidth')
			  func s:sw()
			    return shiftwidth()
			  endfunc
			else
			  func s:sw()
			    return &sw
			  endfunc
			endif
<		And then use s:sw() instead of &sw.


simplify({filename})					*simplify()*
		Simplify the file name as much as possible without changing
		the meaning.  Shortcuts (on MS-Windows) or symbolic links (on
		Unix) are not resolved.  If the first path component in
		{filename} designates the current directory, this will be
		valid for the result as well.  A trailing path separator is
		not removed either.
		Example: >
			simplify("./dir/.././/file/") == "./file/"
<		Note: The combination "dir/.." is only removed if "dir" is
		a searchable directory or does not exist.  On Unix, it is also
		removed when "dir" is a symbolic link within the same
		directory.  In order to resolve all the involved symbolic
		links before simplifying the path name, use |resolve()|.


sin({expr})						*sin()*
		Return the sine of {expr}, measured in radians, as a |Float|.
		{expr} must evaluate to a |Float| or a |Number|.
		Examples: >
			:echo sin(100)
<			-0.506366 >
			:echo sin(-4.01)
<			0.763301
		{only available when compiled with the |+float| feature}
		

sinh({expr})						*sinh()*
		Return the hyperbolic sine of {expr} as a |Float| in the range
		[-inf, inf].
		{expr} must evaluate to a |Float| or a |Number|.
		Examples: >
			:echo sinh(0.5)
<			0.521095 >
			:echo sinh(-0.9)
<			-1.026517
		{only available when compiled with the |+float| feature}


sort({list} [, {func} [, {dict}]])			*sort()* *E702*
		Sort the items in {list} in-place.  Returns {list}.
		
		If you want a list to remain unmodified make a copy first: >
			:let sortedlist = sort(copy(mylist))

<		When {func} is omitted, is empty or zero, then sort() uses the
		string representation of each item to sort on.  Numbers sort
		after Strings, |Lists| after Numbers.  For sorting text in the
		current buffer use |:sort|.

		When {func} is given and it is '1' or 'i' then case is
		ignored.
		
		When {func} is given and it is 'n' then all items will be
		sorted numerical (Implementation detail: This uses the
		strtod() function to parse numbers, Strings, Lists, Dicts and
		Funcrefs will be considered as being 0).

		When {func} is a |Funcref| or a function name, this function
		is called to compare items.  The function is invoked with two
		items as argument and must return zero if they are equal, 1 or
		bigger if the first one sorts after the second one, -1 or
		smaller if the first one sorts before the second one.

		{dict} is for functions with the "dict" attribute.  It will be
		used to set the local variable "self". |Dictionary-function|

		The sort is stable, items which compare equal (as number or as
		string) will keep their relative position. E.g., when sorting
		on numbers, text strings will sort next to each other, in the
		same order as they were originally.

		Also see |uniq()|.

		Example: >
			func MyCompare(i1, i2)
			   return a:i1 == a:i2 ? 0 : a:i1 > a:i2 ? 1 : -1
			endfunc
			let sortedlist = sort(mylist, "MyCompare")
<		A shorter compare version for this specific simple case, which
		ignores overflow: >
			func MyCompare(i1, i2)
			   return a:i1 - a:i2
			endfunc
<
							*soundfold()*
soundfold({word})
		Return the sound-folded equivalent of {word}.  Uses the first
		language in 'spelllang' for the current window that supports
		soundfolding.  'spell' must be set.  When no sound folding is
		possible the {word} is returned unmodified.
		This can be used for making spelling suggestions.  Note that
		the method can be quite slow.

							*spellbadword()*
spellbadword([{sentence}])
		Without argument: The result is the badly spelled word under
		or after the cursor.  The cursor is moved to the start of the
		bad word.  When no bad word is found in the cursor line the
		result is an empty string and the cursor doesn't move.

		With argument: The result is the first word in {sentence} that
		is badly spelled.  If there are no spelling mistakes the
		result is an empty string.

		The return value is a list with two items:
		- The badly spelled word or an empty string.
		- The type of the spelling error:
			"bad"		spelling mistake
			"rare"		rare word
			"local"		word only valid in another region
			"caps"		word should start with Capital
		Example: >
			echo spellbadword("the quik brown fox")
<			['quik', 'bad'] ~

		The spelling information for the current window is used.  The
		'spell' option must be set and the value of 'spelllang' is
		used.

							*spellsuggest()*
spellsuggest({word} [, {max} [, {capital}]])
		Return a |List| with spelling suggestions to replace {word}.
		When {max} is given up to this number of suggestions are
		returned.  Otherwise up to 25 suggestions are returned.

		When the {capital} argument is given and it's non-zero only
		suggestions with a leading capital will be given.  Use this
		after a match with 'spellcapcheck'.

		{word} can be a badly spelled word followed by other text.
		This allows for joining two words that were split.  The
		suggestions also include the following text, thus you can
		replace a line.

		{word} may also be a good word.  Similar words will then be
		returned.  {word} itself is not included in the suggestions,
		although it may appear capitalized.

		The spelling information for the current window is used.  The
		'spell' option must be set and the values of 'spelllang' and
		'spellsuggest' are used.


split({expr} [, {pattern} [, {keepempty}]])			*split()*
		Make a |List| out of {expr}.  When {pattern} is omitted or
		empty each white-separated sequence of characters becomes an
		item.
		Otherwise the string is split where {pattern} matches,
		removing the matched characters. 'ignorecase' is not used
		here, add \c to ignore case. |/\c|
		When the first or last item is empty it is omitted, unless the
		{keepempty} argument is given and it's non-zero.
		Other empty items are kept when {pattern} matches at least one
		character or when {keepempty} is non-zero.
		Example: >
			:let words = split(getline('.'), '\W\+')
<		To split a string in individual characters: >
			:for c in split(mystring, '\zs')
<		If you want to keep the separator you can also use '\zs': >
			:echo split('abc:def:ghi', ':\zs')
<			['abc:', 'def:', 'ghi'] ~
		Splitting a table where the first element can be empty: >
			:let items = split(line, ':', 1)
<		The opposite function is |join()|.


sqrt({expr})						*sqrt()*
		Return the non-negative square root of Float {expr} as a
		|Float|.
		{expr} must evaluate to a |Float| or a |Number|.  When {expr}
		is negative the result is NaN (Not a Number).
		Examples: >
			:echo sqrt(100)
<			10.0 >
			:echo sqrt(-4.01)
<			nan
		"nan" may be different, it depends on system libraries.
		{only available when compiled with the |+float| feature}
		

str2float( {expr})					*str2float()*
		Convert String {expr} to a Float.  This mostly works the same
		as when using a floating point number in an expression, see
		|floating-point-format|.  But it's a bit more permissive.
		E.g., "1e40" is accepted, while in an expression you need to
		write "1.0e40".
		Text after the number is silently ignored.
		The decimal point is always '.', no matter what the locale is
		set to.  A comma ends the number: "12,345.67" is converted to
		12.0.  You can strip out thousands separators with
		|substitute()|: >
			let f = str2float(substitute(text, ',', '', 'g'))
<		{only available when compiled with the |+float| feature}


str2nr( {expr} [, {base}])				*str2nr()*
		Convert string {expr} to a number.
		{base} is the conversion base, it can be 8, 10 or 16.
		When {base} is omitted base 10 is used.  This also means that
		a leading zero doesn't cause octal conversion to be used, as
		with the default String to Number conversion.
		When {base} is 16 a leading "0x" or "0X" is ignored.  With a
		different base the result will be zero.
		Text after the number is silently ignored.


strchars({expr})					*strchars()*
		The result is a Number, which is the number of characters
		String {expr} occupies.  Composing characters are counted
		separately.
		Also see |strlen()|, |strdisplaywidth()| and |strwidth()|.

strdisplaywidth({expr}[, {col}])			*strdisplaywidth()*
		The result is a Number, which is the number of display cells
		String {expr} occupies on the screen when it starts a {col}.
		When {col} is omitted zero is used.  Otherwise it is the
		screen column where to start.  This matters for Tab
		characters.
		The option settings of the current window are used.  This
		matters for anything that's displayed differently, such as
		'tabstop' and 'display'.
		When {expr} contains characters with East Asian Width Class
		Ambiguous, this function's return value depends on 'ambiwidth'.
		Also see |strlen()|, |strwidth()| and |strchars()|.

strftime({format} [, {time}])				*strftime()*
		The result is a String, which is a formatted date and time, as
		specified by the {format} string.  The given {time} is used,
		or the current time if no time is given.  The accepted
		{format} depends on your system, thus this is not portable!
		See the manual page of the C function strftime() for the
		format.  The maximum length of the result is 80 characters.
		See also |localtime()| and |getftime()|.
		The language can be changed with the |:language| command.
		Examples: >
		  :echo strftime("%c")		   Sun Apr 27 11:49:23 1997
		  :echo strftime("%Y %b %d %X")	   1997 Apr 27 11:53:25
		  :echo strftime("%y%m%d %T")	   970427 11:53:55
		  :echo strftime("%H:%M")	   11:55
		  :echo strftime("%c", getftime("file.c"))
						   Show mod time of file.c.
<		Not available on all systems.  To check use: >
			:if exists("*strftime")

stridx({haystack}, {needle} [, {start}])		*stridx()*
		The result is a Number, which gives the byte index in
		{haystack} of the first occurrence of the String {needle}.
		If {start} is specified, the search starts at index {start}.
		This can be used to find a second match: >
			:let colon1 = stridx(line, ":")
			:let colon2 = stridx(line, ":", colon1 + 1)
<		The search is done case-sensitive.
		For pattern searches use |match()|.
		-1 is returned if the {needle} does not occur in {haystack}.
		See also |strridx()|.
		Examples: >
		  :echo stridx("An Example", "Example")	     3
		  :echo stridx("Starting point", "Start")    0
		  :echo stridx("Starting point", "start")   -1
<						*strstr()* *strchr()*
		stridx() works similar to the C function strstr().  When used
		with a single character it works similar to strchr().

							*string()*
string({expr})	Return {expr} converted to a String.  If {expr} is a Number,
		Float, String or a composition of them, then the result can be
		parsed back with |eval()|.
			{expr} type	result ~
			String		'string'
			Number		123
			Float		123.123456 or 1.123456e8
			Funcref		function('name')
			List		[item, item]
			Dictionary	{key: value, key: value}
		Note that in String values the ' character is doubled.
		Also see |strtrans()|.

							*strlen()*
strlen({expr})	The result is a Number, which is the length of the String
		{expr} in bytes.
		If you want to count the number of multi-byte characters (not
		counting composing characters) use something like this: >

			:let len = strlen(substitute(str, ".", "x", "g"))
<
		If the argument is a Number it is first converted to a String.
		For other types an error is given.
		Also see |len()|, |strchars()|, |strdisplaywidth()| and
		|strwidth()|.

strpart({src}, {start}[, {len}])			*strpart()*
		The result is a String, which is part of {src}, starting from
		byte {start}, with the byte length {len}.
		When non-existing bytes are included, this doesn't result in
		an error, the bytes are simply omitted.
		If {len} is missing, the copy continues from {start} till the
		end of the {src}. >
			strpart("abcdefg", 3, 2)    == "de"
			strpart("abcdefg", -2, 4)   == "ab"
			strpart("abcdefg", 5, 4)    == "fg"
			strpart("abcdefg", 3)	    == "defg"
<		Note: To get the first character, {start} must be 0.  For
		example, to get three bytes under and after the cursor: >
			strpart(getline("."), col(".") - 1, 3)
<
strridx({haystack}, {needle} [, {start}])			*strridx()*
		The result is a Number, which gives the byte index in
		{haystack} of the last occurrence of the String {needle}.
		When {start} is specified, matches beyond this index are
		ignored.  This can be used to find a match before a previous
		match: >
			:let lastcomma = strridx(line, ",")
			:let comma2 = strridx(line, ",", lastcomma - 1)
<		The search is done case-sensitive.
		For pattern searches use |match()|.
		-1 is returned if the {needle} does not occur in {haystack}.
		If the {needle} is empty the length of {haystack} is returned.
		See also |stridx()|.  Examples: >
		  :echo strridx("an angry armadillo", "an")	     3
<							*strrchr()*
		When used with a single character it works similar to the C
		function strrchr().

strtrans({expr})					*strtrans()*
		The result is a String, which is {expr} with all unprintable
		characters translated into printable characters |'isprint'|.
		Like they are shown in a window.  Example: >
			echo strtrans(@a)
<		This displays a newline in register a as "^@" instead of
		starting a new line.

strwidth({expr})					*strwidth()*
		The result is a Number, which is the number of display cells
		String {expr} occupies.  A Tab character is counted as one
		cell, alternatively use |strdisplaywidth()|.
		When {expr} contains characters with East Asian Width Class
		Ambiguous, this function's return value depends on 'ambiwidth'.
		Also see |strlen()|, |strdisplaywidth()| and |strchars()|.

submatch({nr}[, {list}])				*submatch()*
		Only for an expression in a |:substitute| command or
		substitute() function.
		Returns the {nr}'th submatch of the matched text.  When {nr}
		is 0 the whole matched text is returned.
		Note that a NL in the string can stand for a line break of a
		multi-line match or a NUL character in the text.
		Also see |sub-replace-expression|.

		If {list} is present and non-zero then submatch() returns 
		a list of strings, similar to |getline()| with two arguments. 
		NL characters in the text represent NUL characters in the
		text.
		Only returns more than one item for |:substitute|, inside
		|substitute()| this list will always contain one or zero
		items, since there are no real line breaks.

		Example: >
			:s/\d\+/\=submatch(0) + 1/
<		This finds the first number in the line and adds one to it.
		A line break is included as a newline character.

substitute({expr}, {pat}, {sub}, {flags})		*substitute()*
		The result is a String, which is a copy of {expr}, in which
		the first match of {pat} is replaced with {sub}.
		When {flags} is "g", all matches of {pat} in {expr} are
		replaced.  Otherwise {flags} should be "".
		
		This works like the ":substitute" command (without any flags).
		But the matching with {pat} is always done like the 'magic'
		option is set and 'cpoptions' is empty (to make scripts
		portable).  'ignorecase' is still relevant, use |/\c| or |/\C|
		if you want to ignore or match case and ignore 'ignorecase'.
		'smartcase' is not used.  See |string-match| for how {pat} is
		used.

		A "~" in {sub} is not replaced with the previous {sub}.
		Note that some codes in {sub} have a special meaning
		|sub-replace-special|.	For example, to replace something with
		"\n" (two characters), use "\\\\n" or '\\n'.

		When {pat} does not match in {expr}, {expr} is returned
		unmodified.

		Example: >
			:let &path = substitute(&path, ",\\=[^,]*$", "", "")
<		This removes the last component of the 'path' option. >
			:echo substitute("testing", ".*", "\\U\\0", "")
<		results in "TESTING".

		When {sub} starts with "\=", the remainder is interpreted as
		an expression. See |sub-replace-expression|.  Example: >
			:echo substitute(s, '%\(\x\x\)',
			   \ '\=nr2char("0x" . submatch(1))', 'g')

synID({lnum}, {col}, {trans})				*synID()*
		The result is a Number, which is the syntax ID at the position
		{lnum} and {col} in the current window.
		The syntax ID can be used with |synIDattr()| and
		|synIDtrans()| to obtain syntax information about text.

		{col} is 1 for the leftmost column, {lnum} is 1 for the first
		line.  'synmaxcol' applies, in a longer line zero is returned.

		When {trans} is non-zero, transparent items are reduced to the
		item that they reveal.	This is useful when wanting to know
		the effective color.  When {trans} is zero, the transparent
		item is returned.  This is useful when wanting to know which
		syntax item is effective (e.g. inside parens).
		Warning: This function can be very slow.  Best speed is
		obtained by going through the file in forward direction.

		Example (echoes the name of the syntax item under the cursor): >
			:echo synIDattr(synID(line("."), col("."), 1), "name")
<

synIDattr({synID}, {what} [, {mode}])			*synIDattr()*
		The result is a String, which is the {what} attribute of
		syntax ID {synID}.  This can be used to obtain information
		about a syntax item.
		{mode} can be "gui", "cterm" or "term", to get the attributes
		for that mode.	When {mode} is omitted, or an invalid value is
		used, the attributes for the currently active highlighting are
		used (GUI, cterm or term).
		Use synIDtrans() to follow linked highlight groups.
		{what}		result
		"name"		the name of the syntax item
		"fg"		foreground color (GUI: color name used to set
				the color, cterm: color number as a string,
				term: empty string)
		"bg"		background color (as with "fg")
		"font"		font name (only available in the GUI)
				|highlight-font|
		"sp"		special color (as with "fg") |highlight-guisp|
		"fg#"		like "fg", but for the GUI and the GUI is
				running the name in "#RRGGBB" form
		"bg#"		like "fg#" for "bg"
		"sp#"		like "fg#" for "sp"
		"bold"		"1" if bold
		"italic"	"1" if italic
		"reverse"	"1" if reverse
		"inverse"	"1" if inverse (= reverse)
		"standout"	"1" if standout
		"underline"	"1" if underlined
		"undercurl"	"1" if undercurled

		Example (echoes the color of the syntax item under the
		cursor): >
	:echo synIDattr(synIDtrans(synID(line("."), col("."), 1)), "fg")
<
synIDtrans({synID})					*synIDtrans()*
		The result is a Number, which is the translated syntax ID of
		{synID}.  This is the syntax group ID of what is being used to
		highlight the character.  Highlight links given with
		":highlight link" are followed.

synconcealed({lnum}, {col})				*synconcealed()*
		The result is a List. The first item in the list is 0 if the
		character at the position {lnum} and {col} is not part of a
		concealable region, 1 if it is. The second item in the list is
		a string. If the first item is 1, the second item contains the
		text which will be displayed in place of the concealed text,
		depending on the current setting of 'conceallevel'. The third
		and final item in the list is a unique number representing the
		specific syntax region matched. This allows detection of the
		beginning of a new concealable region if there are two
		consecutive regions with the same replacement character.
		For an example use see $VIMRUNTIME/syntax/2html.vim .


synstack({lnum}, {col})					*synstack()*
		Return a |List|, which is the stack of syntax items at the
		position {lnum} and {col} in the current window.  Each item in
		the List is an ID like what |synID()| returns.
		The first item in the List is the outer region, following are
		items contained in that one.  The last one is what |synID()|
		returns, unless not the whole item is highlighted or it is a
		transparent item.
		This function is useful for debugging a syntax file.
		Example that shows the syntax stack under the cursor: >
			for id in synstack(line("."), col("."))
			   echo synIDattr(id, "name")
			endfor
<		When the position specified with {lnum} and {col} is invalid
		nothing is returned.  The position just after the last
		character in a line and the first column in an empty line are
		valid positions.

system({expr} [, {input}])				*system()* *E677*
		Get the output of the shell command {expr} as a string.  See
		|systemlist()| to get the output as a List.

		When {input} is given and is a string this string is written 
		to a file and passed as stdin to the command.  The string is 
		written as-is, you need to take care of using the correct line 
		separators yourself.
		If {input} is given and is a |List| it is written to the file
		in a way |writefile()| does with {binary} set to "b" (i.e.
		with a newline between each list item with newlines inside
		list items converted to NULs).  
		Pipes are not used.

		When prepended by |:silent| the shell will not be set to
		cooked mode.  This is meant to be used for commands that do
		not need the user to type.  It avoids stray characters showing
		up on the screen which require |CTRL-L| to remove. >
			:silent let f = system('ls *.vim')
<
		Note: Use |shellescape()| or |::S| with |expand()| or 
		|fnamemodify()| to escape special characters in a command 
		argument.  Newlines in {expr} may cause the command to fail.  
		The characters in 'shellquote' and 'shellxquote' may also 
		cause trouble.
		This is not to be used for interactive commands.

		The result is a String.  Example: >
		    :let files = system("ls " .  shellescape(expand('%:h')))
		    :let files = system('ls ' . expand('%:h:S'))

<		To make the result more system-independent, the shell output
		is filtered to replace <CR> with <NL> for Macintosh, and
		<CR><NL> with <NL> for DOS-like systems.
		To avoid the string being truncated at a NUL, all NUL
		characters are replaced with SOH (0x01).

		The command executed is constructed using several options:
	'shell' 'shellcmdflag' 'shellxquote' {expr} 'shellredir' {tmp} 'shellxquote'
		({tmp} is an automatically generated file name).
		For Unix and OS/2 braces are put around {expr} to allow for
		concatenated commands.

		The command will be executed in "cooked" mode, so that a
		CTRL-C will interrupt the command (on Unix at least).

		The resulting error code can be found in |v:shell_error|.
		This function will fail in |restricted-mode|.

		Note that any wrong value in the options mentioned above may
		make the function fail.  It has also been reported to fail
		when using a security agent application.
		Unlike ":!cmd" there is no automatic check for changed files.
		Use |:checktime| to force a check.


systemlist({expr} [, {input}])				*systemlist()*
		Same as |system()|, but returns a |List| with lines (parts of 
		output separated by NL) with NULs transformed into NLs. Output 
		is the same as |readfile()| will output with {binary} argument 
		set to "b".

		Returns an empty string on error, so be careful not to run 
		into |E706|.


tabpagebuflist([{arg}])					*tabpagebuflist()*
		The result is a |List|, where each item is the number of the
		buffer associated with each window in the current tab page.
		{arg} specifies the number of tab page to be used.  When
		omitted the current tab page is used.
		When {arg} is invalid the number zero is returned.
		To get a list of all buffers in all tabs use this: >
			let buflist = []
			for i in range(tabpagenr('$'))
			   call extend(buflist, tabpagebuflist(i + 1))
			endfor
<		Note that a buffer may appear in more than one window.


tabpagenr([{arg}])					*tabpagenr()*
		The result is a Number, which is the number of the current
		tab page.  The first tab page has number 1.
		When the optional argument is "$", the number of the last tab
		page is returned (the tab page count).
		The number can be used with the |:tab| command.


tabpagewinnr({tabarg} [, {arg}])			*tabpagewinnr()*
		Like |winnr()| but for tab page {tabarg}.
		{tabarg} specifies the number of tab page to be used.
		{arg} is used like with |winnr()|:
		- When omitted the current window number is returned.  This is
		  the window which will be used when going to this tab page.
		- When "$" the number of windows is returned.
		- When "#" the previous window nr is returned.
		Useful examples: >
		    tabpagewinnr(1)	    " current window of tab page 1
		    tabpagewinnr(4, '$')    " number of windows in tab page 4
<		When {tabarg} is invalid zero is returned.

							*tagfiles()*
tagfiles()	Returns a |List| with the file names used to search for tags
		for the current buffer.  This is the 'tags' option expanded.


taglist({expr})							*taglist()*
		Returns a list of tags matching the regular expression {expr}.
		Each list item is a dictionary with at least the following
		entries:
			name		Name of the tag.
			filename	Name of the file where the tag is
					defined.  It is either relative to the
					current directory or a full path.
			cmd		Ex command used to locate the tag in
					the file.
			kind		Type of the tag.  The value for this
					entry depends on the language specific
					kind values.  Only available when
					using a tags file generated by
					Exuberant ctags or hdrtag.
			static		A file specific tag.  Refer to
					|static-tag| for more information.
		More entries may be present, depending on the content of the
		tags file: access, implementation, inherits and signature.
		Refer to the ctags documentation for information about these
		fields.  For C code the fields "struct", "class" and "enum"
		may appear, they give the name of the entity the tag is
		contained in.

		The ex-command 'cmd' can be either an ex search pattern, a
		line number or a line number followed by a byte number.

		If there are no matching tags, then an empty list is returned.

		To get an exact tag match, the anchors '^' and '$' should be
		used in {expr}.  This also make the function work faster.
		Refer to |tag-regexp| for more information about the tag
		search regular expression pattern.

		Refer to |'tags'| for information about how the tags file is
		located by Vim. Refer to |tags-file-format| for the format of
		the tags file generated by the different ctags tools.

tempname()					*tempname()* *temp-file-name*
		The result is a String, which is the name of a file that
		doesn't exist.	It can be used for a temporary file.  The name
		is different for at least 26 consecutive calls.  Example: >
			:let tmpfile = tempname()
			:exe "redir > " . tmpfile
<		For Unix, the file will be in a private directory |tempfile|.
		For MS-Windows forward slashes are used when the 'shellslash'
		option is set or when 'shellcmdflag' starts with '-'.


tan({expr})						*tan()*
		Return the tangent of {expr}, measured in radians, as a |Float|
		in the range [-inf, inf].
		{expr} must evaluate to a |Float| or a |Number|.
		Examples: >
			:echo tan(10)
<			0.648361 >
			:echo tan(-4.01)
<			-1.181502
		{only available when compiled with the |+float| feature}


tanh({expr})						*tanh()*
		Return the hyperbolic tangent of {expr} as a |Float| in the
		range [-1, 1].
		{expr} must evaluate to a |Float| or a |Number|.
		Examples: >
			:echo tanh(0.5)
<			0.462117 >
			:echo tanh(-1)
<			-0.761594
		{only available when compiled with the |+float| feature}


tolower({expr})						*tolower()*
		The result is a copy of the String given, with all uppercase
		characters turned into lowercase (just like applying |gu| to
		the string).

toupper({expr})						*toupper()*
		The result is a copy of the String given, with all lowercase
		characters turned into uppercase (just like applying |gU| to
		the string).

tr({src}, {fromstr}, {tostr})				*tr()*
		The result is a copy of the {src} string with all characters
		which appear in {fromstr} replaced by the character in that
		position in the {tostr} string.  Thus the first character in
		{fromstr} is translated into the first character in {tostr}
		and so on.  Exactly like the unix "tr" command.
		This code also deals with multibyte characters properly.

		Examples: >
			echo tr("hello there", "ht", "HT")
<		returns "Hello THere" >
			echo tr("<blob>", "<>", "{}")
<		returns "{blob}"

trunc({expr})							*trunc()*
		Return the largest integral value with magnitude less than or
		equal to {expr} as a |Float| (truncate towards zero).
		{expr} must evaluate to a |Float| or a |Number|.
		Examples: >
			echo trunc(1.456)
<			1.0  >
			echo trunc(-5.456)
<			-5.0  >
			echo trunc(4.0)
<			4.0
		{only available when compiled with the |+float| feature}
		
							*type()*
type({expr})	The result is a Number, depending on the type of {expr}:
			Number:	    0
			String:	    1
			Funcref:    2
			List:	    3
			Dictionary: 4
			Float:	    5
		To avoid the magic numbers it should be used this way: >
			:if type(myvar) == type(0)
			:if type(myvar) == type("")
			:if type(myvar) == type(function("tr"))
			:if type(myvar) == type([])
			:if type(myvar) == type({})
			:if type(myvar) == type(0.0)

undofile({name})					*undofile()*
		Return the name of the undo file that would be used for a file
		with name {name} when writing.  This uses the 'undodir'
		option, finding directories that exist.  It does not check if
		the undo file exists.
		{name} is always expanded to the full path, since that is what
		is used internally.
		If {name} is empty undofile() returns an empty string, since a
		buffer without a file name will not write an undo file.
		Useful in combination with |:wundo| and |:rundo|.
		When compiled without the +persistent_undo option this always
		returns an empty string.

undotree()						*undotree()*
		Return the current state of the undo tree in a dictionary with
		the following items:
		  "seq_last"	The highest undo sequence number used.
		  "seq_cur"	The sequence number of the current position in
				the undo tree.  This differs from "seq_last"
				when some changes were undone.
		  "time_cur"	Time last used for |:earlier| and related
				commands.  Use |strftime()| to convert to
				something readable.
		  "save_last"	Number of the last file write.  Zero when no
				write yet.
		  "save_cur"	Number of the current position in the undo
				tree.  
		  "synced"	Non-zero when the last undo block was synced.
				This happens when waiting from input from the
				user.  See |undo-blocks|.
		  "entries"	A list of dictionaries with information about
				undo blocks.

		The first item in the "entries" list is the oldest undo item.
		Each List item is a Dictionary with these items:
		  "seq"		Undo sequence number.  Same as what appears in
				|:undolist|.
		  "time"	Timestamp when the change happened.  Use
				|strftime()| to convert to something readable.
		  "newhead"	Only appears in the item that is the last one
				that was added.  This marks the last change
				and where further changes will be added.
		  "curhead"	Only appears in the item that is the last one
				that was undone.  This marks the current
				position in the undo tree, the block that will
				be used by a redo command.  When nothing was
				undone after the last change this item will
				not appear anywhere.
		  "save"	Only appears on the last block before a file
				write.  The number is the write count.  The
				first write has number 1, the last one the
				"save_last" mentioned above.
		  "alt"		Alternate entry.  This is again a List of undo
				blocks.  Each item may again have an "alt"
				item.

uniq({list} [, {func} [, {dict}]])			*uniq()* *E882*
		Remove second and succeeding copies of repeated adjacent
		{list} items in-place.  Returns {list}.  If you want a list
		to remain unmodified make a copy first: >
			:let newlist = uniq(copy(mylist))
<		The default compare function uses the string representation of
		each item.  For the use of {func} and {dict} see |sort()|.

values({dict})						*values()*
		Return a |List| with all the values of {dict}.	The |List| is
		in arbitrary order.


virtcol({expr})						*virtcol()*
		The result is a Number, which is the screen column of the file
		position given with {expr}.  That is, the last screen position
		occupied by the character at that position, when the screen
		would be of unlimited width.  When there is a <Tab> at the
		position, the returned Number will be the column at the end of
		the <Tab>.  For example, for a <Tab> in column 1, with 'ts'
		set to 8, it returns 8. |conceal| is ignored.
		For the byte position use |col()|.
		For the use of {expr} see |col()|.
		When 'virtualedit' is used {expr} can be [lnum, col, off], where
		"off" is the offset in screen columns from the start of the
		character.  E.g., a position within a <Tab> or after the last
		character.  When "off" is omitted zero is used.
		When Virtual editing is active in the current mode, a position
		beyond the end of the line can be returned. |'virtualedit'|
		The accepted positions are:
		    .	    the cursor position
		    $	    the end of the cursor line (the result is the
			    number of displayed characters in the cursor line
			    plus one)
		    'x	    position of mark x (if the mark is not set, 0 is
			    returned)
		Note that only marks in the current file can be used.
		Examples: >
  virtcol(".")	   with text "foo^Lbar", with cursor on the "^L", returns 5
  virtcol("$")	   with text "foo^Lbar", returns 9
  virtcol("'t")    with text "	  there", with 't at 'h', returns 6
<		The first column is 1.	0 is returned for an error.
		A more advanced example that echoes the maximum length of
		all lines: >
		    echo max(map(range(1, line('$')), "virtcol([v:val, '$'])"))


visualmode([expr])						*visualmode()*
		The result is a String, which describes the last Visual mode
		used in the current buffer.  Initially it returns an empty
		string, but once Visual mode has been used, it returns "v",
		"V", or "<CTRL-V>" (a single CTRL-V character) for
		character-wise, line-wise, or block-wise Visual mode
		respectively.
		Example: >
			:exe "normal " . visualmode()
<		This enters the same Visual mode as before.  It is also useful
		in scripts if you wish to act differently depending on the
		Visual mode that was used.
		If Visual mode is active, use |mode()| to get the Visual mode
		(e.g., in a |:vmap|).
							*non-zero-arg*
		If [expr] is supplied and it evaluates to a non-zero Number or
		a non-empty String, then the Visual mode will be cleared and
		the old value is returned.  Note that " " and "0" are also
		non-empty strings, thus cause the mode to be cleared.  A List,
		Dictionary or Float is not a Number or String, thus does not
		cause the mode to be cleared.

wildmenumode()					*wildmenumode()*
		Returns non-zero when the wildmenu is active and zero
		otherwise.  See 'wildmenu' and 'wildmode'.
		This can be used in mappings to handle the 'wildcharm' option
		gracefully. (Makes only sense with |mapmode-c| mappings).

		For example to make <c-j> work like <down> in wildmode, use: >
    :cnoremap <expr> <C-j> wildmenumode() ? "\<Down>\<Tab>" : "\<c-j>"
<
		(Note, this needs the 'wildcharm' option set appropriately).


							*winbufnr()*
winbufnr({nr})	The result is a Number, which is the number of the buffer
		associated with window {nr}.  When {nr} is zero, the number of
		the buffer in the current window is returned.  When window
		{nr} doesn't exist, -1 is returned.
		Example: >
  :echo "The file in the current window is " . bufname(winbufnr(0))
<
							*wincol()*
wincol()	The result is a Number, which is the virtual column of the
		cursor in the window.  This is counting screen cells from the
		left side of the window.  The leftmost column is one.

winheight({nr})						*winheight()*
		The result is a Number, which is the height of window {nr}.
		When {nr} is zero, the height of the current window is
		returned.  When window {nr} doesn't exist, -1 is returned.
		An existing window always has a height of zero or more.
		Examples: >
  :echo "The current window has " . winheight(0) . " lines."
<
							*winline()*
winline()	The result is a Number, which is the screen line of the cursor
		in the window.	This is counting screen lines from the top of
		the window.  The first line is one.
		If the cursor was moved the view on the file will be updated
		first, this may cause a scroll.

							*winnr()*
winnr([{arg}])	The result is a Number, which is the number of the current
		window.  The top window has number 1.
		When the optional argument is "$", the number of the
		last window is returned (the window count). >
			let window_count = winnr('$')
<		When the optional argument is "#", the number of the last
		accessed window is returned (where |CTRL-W_p| goes to).
		If there is no previous window or it is in another tab page 0
		is returned.
		The number can be used with |CTRL-W_w| and ":wincmd w"
		|:wincmd|.
		Also see |tabpagewinnr()|.

							*winrestcmd()*
winrestcmd()	Returns a sequence of |:resize| commands that should restore
		the current window sizes.  Only works properly when no windows
		are opened or closed and the current window and tab page is
		unchanged.
		Example: >
			:let cmd = winrestcmd()
			:call MessWithWindowSizes()
			:exe cmd
<
							*winrestview()*
winrestview({dict})
		Uses the |Dictionary| returned by |winsaveview()| to restore
		the view of the current window.
		Note: The {dict} does not have to contain all values, that are
		returned by |winsaveview()|. If values are missing, those
		settings won't be restored. So you can use: >
		    :call winrestview({'curswant': 4})
<
		This will only set the curswant value (the column the cursor
		wants to move on vertical movements) of the cursor to column 5
		(yes, that is 5), while all other settings will remain the
		same. This is useful, if you set the cursor position manually.

		If you have changed the values the result is unpredictable.
		If the window size changed the result won't be the same.

							*winsaveview()*
winsaveview()	Returns a |Dictionary| that contains information to restore
		the view of the current window.  Use |winrestview()| to
		restore the view.
		This is useful if you have a mapping that jumps around in the
		buffer and you want to go back to the original view.
		This does not save fold information.  Use the 'foldenable'
		option to temporarily switch off folding, so that folds are
		not opened when moving around. This may have side effects.
		The return value includes:
			lnum		cursor line number
			col		cursor column (Note: the first column
					zero, as opposed to what getpos()
					returns)
			coladd		cursor column offset for 'virtualedit'
			curswant	column for vertical movement
			topline		first line in the window
			topfill		filler lines, only in diff mode
			leftcol		first column displayed
			skipcol		columns skipped
		Note that no option values are saved.


winwidth({nr})						*winwidth()*
		The result is a Number, which is the width of window {nr}.
		When {nr} is zero, the width of the current window is
		returned.  When window {nr} doesn't exist, -1 is returned.
		An existing window always has a width of zero or more.
		Examples: >
  :echo "The current window has " . winwidth(0) . " columns."
  :if winwidth(0) <= 50
  :  exe "normal 50\<C-W>|"
  :endif
<
							*writefile()*
writefile({list}, {fname} [, {binary}])
		Write |List| {list} to file {fname}.  Each list item is
		separated with a NL.  Each list item must be a String or
		Number.
		When {binary} is equal to "b" binary mode is used: There will
		not be a NL after the last list item.  An empty item at the
		end does cause the last line in the file to end in a NL.
		All NL characters are replaced with a NUL character.
		Inserting CR characters needs to be done before passing {list}
		to writefile().
		An existing file is overwritten, if possible.
		When the write fails -1 is returned, otherwise 0.  There is an
		error message if the file can't be created or when writing
		fails.
		Also see |readfile()|.
		To copy a file byte for byte: >
			:let fl = readfile("foo", "b")
			:call writefile(fl, "foocopy", "b")


xor({expr}, {expr})					*xor()*
		Bitwise XOR on the two arguments.  The arguments are converted
		to a number.  A List, Dict or Float argument causes an error.
		Example: >
			:let bits = xor(bits, 0x80)
<


							*feature-list*
There are four types of features:
1.  Features that are only supported when they have been enabled when Vim
    was compiled |+feature-list|.  Example: >
	:if has("cindent")
2.  Features that are only supported when certain conditions have been met.
    Example: >
	:if has("gui_running")
<							*has-patch*
3.  Included patches.  The "patch123" feature means that patch 123 has been
    included.  Note that this form does not check the version of Vim, you need
    to inspect |v:version| for that.
    Example (checking version 6.2.148 or later): >
	:if v:version > 602 || v:version == 602 && has("patch148")
<    Note that it's possible for patch 147 to be omitted even though 148 is
    included.

4.  Beyond a certain version or at a certain version and including a specific
    patch.  The "patch-7.4.237" feature means that the Vim version is 7.5 or
    later, or it is version 7.4 and patch 237 was included.
    Note that this only works for patch 7.4.237 and later, before that you
    need to use the example above that checks v:version.  Example: >
	:if has("patch-7.4.248")
<    Note that it's possible for patch 147 to be omitted even though 148 is
    included.

							*string-match*
Matching a pattern in a String

A regexp pattern as explained at |pattern| is normally used to find a match in
the buffer lines.  When a pattern is used to find a match in a String, almost
everything works in the same way.  The difference is that a String is handled
like it is one line.  When it contains a "\n" character, this is not seen as a
line break for the pattern.  It can be matched with a "\n" in the pattern, or
with ".".  Example: >
	:let a = "aaaa\nxxxx"
	:echo matchstr(a, "..\n..")
	aa
	xx
	:echo matchstr(a, "a.x")
	a
	x

Don't forget that "^" will only match at the first character of the String and
"$" at the last character of the string.  They don't match after or before a
"\n".

==============================================================================
5. Defining functions					*user-functions*

New functions can be defined.  These can be called just like builtin
functions.  The function executes a sequence of Ex commands.  Normal mode
commands can be executed with the |:normal| command.

The function name must start with an uppercase letter, to avoid confusion with
builtin functions.  To prevent from using the same name in different scripts
avoid obvious, short names.  A good habit is to start the function name with
the name of the script, e.g., "HTMLcolor()".

It's also possible to use curly braces, see |curly-braces-names|.  And the
|autoload| facility is useful to define a function only when it's called.

							*local-function*
A function local to a script must start with "s:".  A local script function
can only be called from within the script and from functions, user commands
and autocommands defined in the script.  It is also possible to call the
function from a mapping defined in the script, but then |<SID>| must be used
instead of "s:" when the mapping is expanded outside of the script.
There are only script-local functions, no buffer-local or window-local
functions.

					*:fu* *:function* *E128* *E129* *E123*
:fu[nction]		List all functions and their arguments.

:fu[nction] {name}	List function {name}.
			{name} can also be a |Dictionary| entry that is a
			|Funcref|: >
				:function dict.init

:fu[nction] /{pattern}	List functions with a name matching {pattern}.
			Example that lists all functions ending with "File": >
				:function /File$
<
							*:function-verbose*
When 'verbose' is non-zero, listing a function will also display where it was
last defined. Example: >

    :verbose function SetFileTypeSH
	function SetFileTypeSH(name)
	    Last set from /usr/share/vim/vim-7.0/filetype.vim
<
See |:verbose-cmd| for more information.

						*E124* *E125* *E853* *E884*
:fu[nction][!] {name}([arguments]) [range] [abort] [dict]
			Define a new function by the name {name}.  The name
			must be made of alphanumeric characters and '_', and
			must start with a capital or "s:" (see above).  Note
			that using "b:" or "g:" is not allowed. (since patch
			7.4.260 E884 is given if the function name has a colon
			in the name, e.g. for "foo:bar()".  Before that patch
			no error was given).

			{name} can also be a |Dictionary| entry that is a
			|Funcref|: >
				:function dict.init(arg)
<			"dict" must be an existing dictionary.	The entry
			"init" is added if it didn't exist yet.  Otherwise [!]
			is required to overwrite an existing function.	The
			result is a |Funcref| to a numbered function.  The
			function can only be used with a |Funcref| and will be
			deleted if there are no more references to it.
								*E127* *E122*
			When a function by this name already exists and [!] is
			not used an error message is given.  When [!] is used,
			an existing function is silently replaced.  Unless it
			is currently being executed, that is an error.

			For the {arguments} see |function-argument|.

					*:func-range* *a:firstline* *a:lastline*
			When the [range] argument is added, the function is
			expected to take care of a range itself.  The range is
			passed as "a:firstline" and "a:lastline".  If [range]
			is excluded, ":{range}call" will call the function for
			each line in the range, with the cursor on the start
			of each line.  See |function-range-example|.
			The cursor is still moved to the first line of the
			range, as is the case with all Ex commands.
								*:func-abort*
			When the [abort] argument is added, the function will
			abort as soon as an error is detected.
								*:func-dict*
			When the [dict] argument is added, the function must
			be invoked through an entry in a |Dictionary|.	The
			local variable "self" will then be set to the
			dictionary.  See |Dictionary-function|.

						*function-search-undo*
			The last used search pattern and the redo command "."
			will not be changed by the function.  This also
			implies that the effect of |:nohlsearch| is undone
			when the function returns.

					*:endf* *:endfunction* *E126* *E193*
:endf[unction]		The end of a function definition.  Must be on a line
			by its own, without other commands.

					*:delf* *:delfunction* *E130* *E131*
:delf[unction] {name}	Delete function {name}.
			{name} can also be a |Dictionary| entry that is a
			|Funcref|: >
				:delfunc dict.init
<			This will remove the "init" entry from "dict".	The
			function is deleted if there are no more references to
			it.
							*:retu* *:return* *E133*
:retu[rn] [expr]	Return from a function.  When "[expr]" is given, it is
			evaluated and returned as the result of the function.
			If "[expr]" is not given, the number 0 is returned.
			When a function ends without an explicit ":return",
			the number 0 is returned.
			Note that there is no check for unreachable lines,
			thus there is no warning if commands follow ":return".

			If the ":return" is used after a |:try| but before the
			matching |:finally| (if present), the commands
			following the ":finally" up to the matching |:endtry|
			are executed first.  This process applies to all
			nested ":try"s inside the function.  The function
			returns at the outermost ":endtry".

						*function-argument* *a:var*
An argument can be defined by giving its name.	In the function this can then
be used as "a:name" ("a:" for argument).
					*a:0* *a:1* *a:000* *E740* *...*
Up to 20 arguments can be given, separated by commas.  After the named
arguments an argument "..." can be specified, which means that more arguments
may optionally be following.  In the function the extra arguments can be used
as "a:1", "a:2", etc.  "a:0" is set to the number of extra arguments (which
can be 0).  "a:000" is set to a |List| that contains these arguments.  Note
that "a:1" is the same as "a:000[0]".
								*E742*
The a: scope and the variables in it cannot be changed, they are fixed.
However, if a |List| or |Dictionary| is used, you can change their contents.
Thus you can pass a |List| to a function and have the function add an item to
it.  If you want to make sure the function cannot change a |List| or
|Dictionary| use |:lockvar|.

When not using "...", the number of arguments in a function call must be equal
to the number of named arguments.  When using "...", the number of arguments
may be larger.

It is also possible to define a function without any arguments.  You must
still supply the () then.  The body of the function follows in the next lines,
until the matching |:endfunction|.  It is allowed to define another function
inside a function body.

							*local-variables*
Inside a function variables can be used.  These are local variables, which
will disappear when the function returns.  Global variables need to be
accessed with "g:".

Example: >
  :function Table(title, ...)
  :  echohl Title
  :  echo a:title
  :  echohl None
  :  echo a:0 . " items:"
  :  for s in a:000
  :    echon ' ' . s
  :  endfor
  :endfunction

This function can then be called with: >
  call Table("Table", "line1", "line2")
  call Table("Empty Table")

To return more than one value, return a |List|: >
  :function Compute(n1, n2)
  :  if a:n2 == 0
  :    return ["fail", 0]
  :  endif
  :  return ["ok", a:n1 / a:n2]
  :endfunction

This function can then be called with: >
  :let [success, div] = Compute(102, 6)
  :if success == "ok"
  :  echo div
  :endif
<
						*:cal* *:call* *E107* *E117*
:[range]cal[l] {name}([arguments])
		Call a function.  The name of the function and its arguments
		are as specified with |:function|.  Up to 20 arguments can be
		used.  The returned value is discarded.
		Without a range and for functions that accept a range, the
		function is called once.  When a range is given the cursor is
		positioned at the start of the first line before executing the
		function.
		When a range is given and the function doesn't handle it
		itself, the function is executed for each line in the range,
		with the cursor in the first column of that line.  The cursor
		is left at the last line (possibly moved by the last function
		call).	The arguments are re-evaluated for each line.  Thus
		this works:
						*function-range-example*  >
	:function Mynumber(arg)
	:  echo line(".") . " " . a:arg
	:endfunction
	:1,5call Mynumber(getline("."))
<
		The "a:firstline" and "a:lastline" are defined anyway, they
		can be used to do something different at the start or end of
		the range.

		Example of a function that handles the range itself: >

	:function Cont() range
	:  execute (a:firstline + 1) . "," . a:lastline . 's/^/\t\\ '
	:endfunction
	:4,8call Cont()
<
		This function inserts the continuation character "\" in front
		of all the lines in the range, except the first one.

		When the function returns a composite value it can be further
		dereferenced, but the range will not be used then.  Example: >
	:4,8call GetDict().method()
<		Here GetDict() gets the range but method() does not.

The recursiveness of user functions is restricted with the |'maxfuncdepth'|
option.


AUTOMATICALLY LOADING FUNCTIONS ~
							*autoload-functions*
When using many or large functions, it's possible to automatically define them
only when they are used.  There are two methods: with an autocommand and with
the "autoload" directory in 'runtimepath'.


Using an autocommand ~

This is introduced in the user manual, section |41.14|.

The autocommand is useful if you have a plugin that is a long Vim script file.
You can define the autocommand and quickly quit the script with |:finish|.
That makes Vim startup faster.	The autocommand should then load the same file
again, setting a variable to skip the |:finish| command.

Use the FuncUndefined autocommand event with a pattern that matches the
function(s) to be defined.  Example: >

	:au FuncUndefined BufNet* source ~/vim/bufnetfuncs.vim

The file "~/vim/bufnetfuncs.vim" should then define functions that start with
"BufNet".  Also see |FuncUndefined|.


Using an autoload script ~
							*autoload* *E746*
This is introduced in the user manual, section |41.15|.

Using a script in the "autoload" directory is simpler, but requires using
exactly the right file name.  A function that can be autoloaded has a name
like this: >

	:call filename#funcname()

When such a function is called, and it is not defined yet, Vim will search the
"autoload" directories in 'runtimepath' for a script file called
"filename.vim".  For example "~/.vim/autoload/filename.vim".  That file should
then define the function like this: >

	function filename#funcname()
	   echo "Done!"
	endfunction

The file name and the name used before the # in the function must match
exactly, and the defined function must have the name exactly as it will be
called.

It is possible to use subdirectories.  Every # in the function name works like
a path separator.  Thus when calling a function: >

	:call foo#bar#func()

Vim will look for the file "autoload/foo/bar.vim" in 'runtimepath'.

This also works when reading a variable that has not been set yet: >

	:let l = foo#bar#lvar

However, when the autoload script was already loaded it won't be loaded again
for an unknown variable.

When assigning a value to such a variable nothing special happens.  This can
be used to pass settings to the autoload script before it's loaded: >

	:let foo#bar#toggle = 1
	:call foo#bar#func()

Note that when you make a mistake and call a function that is supposed to be
defined in an autoload script, but the script doesn't actually define the
function, the script will be sourced every time you try to call the function.
And you will get an error message every time.

Also note that if you have two script files, and one calls a function in the
other and vice versa, before the used function is defined, it won't work.
Avoid using the autoload functionality at the toplevel.

Hint: If you distribute a bunch of scripts you can pack them together with the
|vimball| utility.  Also read the user manual |distribute-script|.

==============================================================================
6. Curly braces names					*curly-braces-names*

In most places where you can use a variable, you can use a "curly braces name"
variable.  This is a regular variable name with one or more expressions
wrapped in braces {} like this: >
	my_{adjective}_variable

When Vim encounters this, it evaluates the expression inside the braces, puts
that in place of the expression, and re-interprets the whole as a variable
name.  So in the above example, if the variable "adjective" was set to
"noisy", then the reference would be to "my_noisy_variable", whereas if
"adjective" was set to "quiet", then it would be to "my_quiet_variable".

One application for this is to create a set of variables governed by an option
value.	For example, the statement >
	echo my_{&background}_message

would output the contents of "my_dark_message" or "my_light_message" depending
on the current value of 'background'.

You can use multiple brace pairs: >
	echo my_{adverb}_{adjective}_message
..or even nest them: >
	echo my_{ad{end_of_word}}_message
where "end_of_word" is either "verb" or "jective".

However, the expression inside the braces must evaluate to a valid single
variable name, e.g. this is invalid: >
	:let foo='a + b'
	:echo c{foo}d
.. since the result of expansion is "ca + bd", which is not a variable name.

						*curly-braces-function-names*
You can call and define functions by an evaluated name in a similar way.
Example: >
	:let func_end='whizz'
	:call my_func_{func_end}(parameter)

This would call the function "my_func_whizz(parameter)".

This does NOT work: >
  :let i = 3
  :let @{i} = ''  " error
  :echo @{i}      " error

==============================================================================
7. Commands						*expression-commands*

:let {var-name} = {expr1}				*:let* *E18*
			Set internal variable {var-name} to the result of the
			expression {expr1}.  The variable will get the type
			from the {expr}.  If {var-name} didn't exist yet, it
			is created.

:let {var-name}[{idx}] = {expr1}			*E689*
			Set a list item to the result of the expression
			{expr1}.  {var-name} must refer to a list and {idx}
			must be a valid index in that list.  For nested list
			the index can be repeated.
			This cannot be used to add an item to a |List|.
			This cannot be used to set a byte in a String.	You
			can do that like this: >
				:let var = var[0:2] . 'X' . var[4:]
<
							*E711* *E719*
:let {var-name}[{idx1}:{idx2}] = {expr1}		*E708* *E709* *E710*
			Set a sequence of items in a |List| to the result of
			the expression {expr1}, which must be a list with the
			correct number of items.
			{idx1} can be omitted, zero is used instead.
			{idx2} can be omitted, meaning the end of the list.
			When the selected range of items is partly past the
			end of the list, items will be added.

					*:let+=* *:let-=* *:let.=* *E734*
:let {var} += {expr1}	Like ":let {var} = {var} + {expr1}".
:let {var} -= {expr1}	Like ":let {var} = {var} - {expr1}".
:let {var} .= {expr1}	Like ":let {var} = {var} . {expr1}".
			These fail if {var} was not set yet and when the type
			of {var} and {expr1} don't fit the operator.


:let ${env-name} = {expr1}			*:let-environment* *:let-$*
			Set environment variable {env-name} to the result of
			the expression {expr1}.  The type is always String.
:let ${env-name} .= {expr1}
			Append {expr1} to the environment variable {env-name}.
			If the environment variable didn't exist yet this
			works like "=".

:let @{reg-name} = {expr1}			*:let-register* *:let-@*
			Write the result of the expression {expr1} in register
			{reg-name}.  {reg-name} must be a single letter, and
			must be the name of a writable register (see
			|registers|).  "@@" can be used for the unnamed
			register, "@/" for the search pattern.
			If the result of {expr1} ends in a <CR> or <NL>, the
			register will be linewise, otherwise it will be set to
			characterwise.
			This can be used to clear the last search pattern: >
				:let @/ = ""
<			This is different from searching for an empty string,
			that would match everywhere.

:let @{reg-name} .= {expr1}
			Append {expr1} to register {reg-name}.	If the
			register was empty it's like setting it to {expr1}.

:let &{option-name} = {expr1}			*:let-option* *:let-&*
			Set option {option-name} to the result of the
			expression {expr1}.  A String or Number value is
			always converted to the type of the option.
			For an option local to a window or buffer the effect
			is just like using the |:set| command: both the local
			value and the global value are changed.
			Example: >
				:let &path = &path . ',/usr/local/include'

:let &{option-name} .= {expr1}
			For a string option: Append {expr1} to the value.
			Does not insert a comma like |:set+=|.

:let &{option-name} += {expr1}
:let &{option-name} -= {expr1}
			For a number or boolean option: Add or subtract
			{expr1}.

:let &l:{option-name} = {expr1}
:let &l:{option-name} .= {expr1}
:let &l:{option-name} += {expr1}
:let &l:{option-name} -= {expr1}
			Like above, but only set the local value of an option
			(if there is one).  Works like |:setlocal|.

:let &g:{option-name} = {expr1}
:let &g:{option-name} .= {expr1}
:let &g:{option-name} += {expr1}
:let &g:{option-name} -= {expr1}
			Like above, but only set the global value of an option
			(if there is one).  Works like |:setglobal|.

:let [{name1}, {name2}, ...] = {expr1}		*:let-unpack* *E687* *E688*
			{expr1} must evaluate to a |List|.  The first item in
			the list is assigned to {name1}, the second item to
			{name2}, etc.
			The number of names must match the number of items in
			the |List|.
			Each name can be one of the items of the ":let"
			command as mentioned above.
			Example: >
				:let [s, item] = GetItem(s)
<			Detail: {expr1} is evaluated first, then the
			assignments are done in sequence.  This matters if
			{name2} depends on {name1}.  Example: >
				:let x = [0, 1]
				:let i = 0
				:let [i, x[i]] = [1, 2]
				:echo x
<			The result is [0, 2].

:let [{name1}, {name2}, ...] .= {expr1}
:let [{name1}, {name2}, ...] += {expr1}
:let [{name1}, {name2}, ...] -= {expr1}
			Like above, but append/add/subtract the value for each
			|List| item.

:let [{name}, ..., ; {lastname}] = {expr1}
			Like |:let-unpack| above, but the |List| may have more
			items than there are names.  A list of the remaining
			items is assigned to {lastname}.  If there are no
			remaining items {lastname} is set to an empty list.
			Example: >
				:let [a, b; rest] = ["aval", "bval", 3, 4]
<
:let [{name}, ..., ; {lastname}] .= {expr1}
:let [{name}, ..., ; {lastname}] += {expr1}
:let [{name}, ..., ; {lastname}] -= {expr1}
			Like above, but append/add/subtract the value for each
			|List| item.

								*E121*
:let {var-name}	..	List the value of variable {var-name}.	Multiple
			variable names may be given.  Special names recognized
			here:				*E738*
			  g:	global variables
			  b:	local buffer variables
			  w:	local window variables
			  t:	local tab page variables
			  s:	script-local variables
			  l:	local function variables
			  v:	Vim variables.

:let			List the values of all variables.  The type of the
			variable is indicated before the value:
			    <nothing>	String
				#	Number
				*	Funcref


:unl[et][!] {name} ...				*:unlet* *:unl* *E108* *E795*
			Remove the internal variable {name}.  Several variable
			names can be given, they are all removed.  The name
			may also be a |List| or |Dictionary| item.
			With [!] no error message is given for non-existing
			variables.
			One or more items from a |List| can be removed: >
				:unlet list[3]	  " remove fourth item
				:unlet list[3:]   " remove fourth item to last
<			One item from a |Dictionary| can be removed at a time: >
				:unlet dict['two']
				:unlet dict.two
<			This is especially useful to clean up used global
			variables and script-local variables (these are not
			deleted when the script ends).  Function-local
			variables are automatically deleted when the function
			ends.

:lockv[ar][!] [depth] {name} ...			*:lockvar* *:lockv*
			Lock the internal variable {name}.  Locking means that
			it can no longer be changed (until it is unlocked).
			A locked variable can be deleted: >
				:lockvar v
				:let v = 'asdf'		" fails!
				:unlet v
<							*E741*
			If you try to change a locked variable you get an
			error message: "E741: Value of {name} is locked"

			[depth] is relevant when locking a |List| or
			|Dictionary|.  It specifies how deep the locking goes:
				1	Lock the |List| or |Dictionary| itself,
					cannot add or remove items, but can
					still change their values.
				2	Also lock the values, cannot change
					the items.  If an item is a |List| or
					|Dictionary|, cannot add or remove
					items, but can still change the
					values.
				3	Like 2 but for the |List| /
					|Dictionary| in the |List| /
					|Dictionary|, one level deeper.
			The default [depth] is 2, thus when {name} is a |List|
			or |Dictionary| the values cannot be changed.
								*E743*
			For unlimited depth use [!] and omit [depth].
			However, there is a maximum depth of 100 to catch
			loops.

			Note that when two variables refer to the same |List|
			and you lock one of them, the |List| will also be
			locked when used through the other variable.
			Example: >
				:let l = [0, 1, 2, 3]
				:let cl = l
				:lockvar l
				:let cl[1] = 99		" won't work!
<			You may want to make a copy of a list to avoid this.
			See |deepcopy()|.


:unlo[ckvar][!] [depth] {name} ...			*:unlockvar* *:unlo*
			Unlock the internal variable {name}.  Does the
			opposite of |:lockvar|.


:if {expr1}			*:if* *:endif* *:en* *E171* *E579* *E580*
:en[dif]		Execute the commands until the next matching ":else"
			or ":endif" if {expr1} evaluates to non-zero.

			From Vim version 4.5 until 5.0, every Ex command in
			between the ":if" and ":endif" is ignored.  These two
			commands were just to allow for future expansions in a
			backwards compatible way.  Nesting was allowed.  Note
			that any ":else" or ":elseif" was ignored, the "else"
			part was not executed either.

			You can use this to remain compatible with older
			versions: >
				:if version >= 500
				:  version-5-specific-commands
				:endif
<			The commands still need to be parsed to find the
			"endif".  Sometimes an older Vim has a problem with a
			new command.  For example, ":silent" is recognized as
			a ":substitute" command.  In that case ":execute" can
			avoid problems: >
				:if version >= 600
				:  execute "silent 1,$delete"
				:endif
<
			NOTE: The ":append" and ":insert" commands don't work
			properly in between ":if" and ":endif".

						*:else* *:el* *E581* *E583*
:el[se]			Execute the commands until the next matching ":else"
			or ":endif" if they previously were not being
			executed.

					*:elseif* *:elsei* *E582* *E584*
:elsei[f] {expr1}	Short for ":else" ":if", with the addition that there
			is no extra ":endif".

:wh[ile] {expr1}			*:while* *:endwhile* *:wh* *:endw*
						*E170* *E585* *E588* *E733*
:endw[hile]		Repeat the commands between ":while" and ":endwhile",
			as long as {expr1} evaluates to non-zero.
			When an error is detected from a command inside the
			loop, execution continues after the "endwhile".
			Example: >
				:let lnum = 1
				:while lnum <= line("$")
				   :call FixLine(lnum)
				   :let lnum = lnum + 1
				:endwhile
<
			NOTE: The ":append" and ":insert" commands don't work
			properly inside a ":while" and ":for" loop.

:for {var} in {list}					*:for* *E690* *E732*
:endfo[r]						*:endfo* *:endfor*
			Repeat the commands between ":for" and ":endfor" for
			each item in {list}.  Variable {var} is set to the
			value of each item.
			When an error is detected for a command inside the
			loop, execution continues after the "endfor".
			Changing {list} inside the loop affects what items are
			used.  Make a copy if this is unwanted: >
				:for item in copy(mylist)
<			When not making a copy, Vim stores a reference to the
			next item in the list, before executing the commands
			with the current item.	Thus the current item can be
			removed without effect.  Removing any later item means
			it will not be found.  Thus the following example
			works (an inefficient way to make a list empty): >
				for item in mylist
				   call remove(mylist, 0)
				endfor
<			Note that reordering the list (e.g., with sort() or
			reverse()) may have unexpected effects.
			Note that the type of each list item should be
			identical to avoid errors for the type of {var}
			changing.  Unlet the variable at the end of the loop
			to allow multiple item types: >
				for item in ["foo", ["bar"]]
				   echo item
				   unlet item  " E706 without this
				endfor

:for [{var1}, {var2}, ...] in {listlist}
:endfo[r]
			Like ":for" above, but each item in {listlist} must be
			a list, of which each item is assigned to {var1},
			{var2}, etc.  Example: >
				:for [lnum, col] in [[1, 3], [2, 5], [3, 8]]
				   :echo getline(lnum)[col]
				:endfor
<
						*:continue* *:con* *E586*
:con[tinue]		When used inside a ":while" or ":for" loop, jumps back
			to the start of the loop.
			If it is used after a |:try| inside the loop but
			before the matching |:finally| (if present), the
			commands following the ":finally" up to the matching
			|:endtry| are executed first.  This process applies to
			all nested ":try"s inside the loop.  The outermost
			":endtry" then jumps back to the start of the loop.

						*:break* *:brea* *E587*
:brea[k]		When used inside a ":while" or ":for" loop, skips to
			the command after the matching ":endwhile" or
			":endfor".
			If it is used after a |:try| inside the loop but
			before the matching |:finally| (if present), the
			commands following the ":finally" up to the matching
			|:endtry| are executed first.  This process applies to
			all nested ":try"s inside the loop.  The outermost
			":endtry" then jumps to the command after the loop.

:try				*:try* *:endt* *:endtry* *E600* *E601* *E602*
:endt[ry]		Change the error handling for the commands between
			":try" and ":endtry" including everything being
			executed across ":source" commands, function calls,
			or autocommand invocations.

			When an error or interrupt is detected and there is
			a |:finally| command following, execution continues
			after the ":finally".  Otherwise, or when the
			":endtry" is reached thereafter, the next
			(dynamically) surrounding ":try" is checked for
			a corresponding ":finally" etc.  Then the script
			processing is terminated.  (Whether a function
			definition has an "abort" argument does not matter.)
			Example: >
		:try | edit too much | finally | echo "cleanup" | endtry
		:echo "impossible"	" not reached, script terminated above
<
			Moreover, an error or interrupt (dynamically) inside
			":try" and ":endtry" is converted to an exception.  It
			can be caught as if it were thrown by a |:throw|
			command (see |:catch|).  In this case, the script
			processing is not terminated.

			The value "Vim:Interrupt" is used for an interrupt
			exception.  An error in a Vim command is converted
			to a value of the form "Vim({command}):{errmsg}",
			other errors are converted to a value of the form
			"Vim:{errmsg}".  {command} is the full command name,
			and {errmsg} is the message that is displayed if the
			error exception is not caught, always beginning with
			the error number.
			Examples: >
		:try | sleep 100 | catch /^Vim:Interrupt$/ | endtry
		:try | edit | catch /^Vim(edit):E\d\+/ | echo "error" | endtry
<
					*:cat* *:catch* *E603* *E604* *E605*
:cat[ch] /{pattern}/	The following commands until the next |:catch|,
			|:finally|, or |:endtry| that belongs to the same
			|:try| as the ":catch" are executed when an exception
			matching {pattern} is being thrown and has not yet
			been caught by a previous ":catch".  Otherwise, these
			commands are skipped.
			When {pattern} is omitted all errors are caught.
			Examples: >
		:catch /^Vim:Interrupt$/	" catch interrupts (CTRL-C)
		:catch /^Vim\%((\a\+)\)\=:E/	" catch all Vim errors
		:catch /^Vim\%((\a\+)\)\=:/	" catch errors and interrupts
		:catch /^Vim(write):/		" catch all errors in :write
		:catch /^Vim\%((\a\+)\)\=:E123/	" catch error E123
		:catch /my-exception/		" catch user exception
		:catch /.*/			" catch everything
		:catch				" same as /.*/
<
			Another character can be used instead of / around the
			{pattern}, so long as it does not have a special
			meaning (e.g., '|' or '"') and doesn't occur inside
			{pattern}.
			Information about the exception is available in
			|v:exception|.  Also see |throw-variables|.
			NOTE: It is not reliable to ":catch" the TEXT of
			an error message because it may vary in different
			locales.

					*:fina* *:finally* *E606* *E607*
:fina[lly]		The following commands until the matching |:endtry|
			are executed whenever the part between the matching
			|:try| and the ":finally" is left:  either by falling
			through to the ":finally" or by a |:continue|,
			|:break|, |:finish|, or |:return|, or by an error or
			interrupt or exception (see |:throw|).

							*:th* *:throw* *E608*
:th[row] {expr1}	The {expr1} is evaluated and thrown as an exception.
			If the ":throw" is used after a |:try| but before the
			first corresponding |:catch|, commands are skipped
			until the first ":catch" matching {expr1} is reached.
			If there is no such ":catch" or if the ":throw" is
			used after a ":catch" but before the |:finally|, the
			commands following the ":finally" (if present) up to
			the matching |:endtry| are executed.  If the ":throw"
			is after the ":finally", commands up to the ":endtry"
			are skipped.  At the ":endtry", this process applies
			again for the next dynamically surrounding ":try"
			(which may be found in a calling function or sourcing
			script), until a matching ":catch" has been found.
			If the exception is not caught, the command processing
			is terminated.
			Example: >
		:try | throw "oops" | catch /^oo/ | echo "caught" | endtry
<			Note that "catch" may need to be on a separate line
			for when an error causes the parsing to skip the whole
			line and not see the "|" that separates the commands.

							*:ec* *:echo*
:ec[ho] {expr1} ..	Echoes each {expr1}, with a space in between.  The
			first {expr1} starts on a new line.
			Also see |:comment|.
			Use "\n" to start a new line.  Use "\r" to move the
			cursor to the first column.
			Uses the highlighting set by the |:echohl| command.
			Cannot be followed by a comment.
			Example: >
		:echo "the value of 'shell' is" &shell
<							*:echo-redraw*
			A later redraw may make the message disappear again.
			And since Vim mostly postpones redrawing until it's
			finished with a sequence of commands this happens
			quite often.  To avoid that a command from before the
			":echo" causes a redraw afterwards (redraws are often
			postponed until you type something), force a redraw
			with the |:redraw| command.  Example: >
		:new | redraw | echo "there is a new window"
<
							*:echon*
:echon {expr1} ..	Echoes each {expr1}, without anything added.  Also see
			|:comment|.
			Uses the highlighting set by the |:echohl| command.
			Cannot be followed by a comment.
			Example: >
				:echon "the value of 'shell' is " &shell
<
			Note the difference between using ":echo", which is a
			Vim command, and ":!echo", which is an external shell
			command: >
		:!echo %		--> filename
<			The arguments of ":!" are expanded, see |:_%|. >
		:!echo "%"		--> filename or "filename"
<			Like the previous example.  Whether you see the double
			quotes or not depends on your 'shell'. >
		:echo %			--> nothing
<			The '%' is an illegal character in an expression. >
		:echo "%"		--> %
<			This just echoes the '%' character. >
		:echo expand("%")	--> filename
<			This calls the expand() function to expand the '%'.

							*:echoh* *:echohl*
:echoh[l] {name}	Use the highlight group {name} for the following
			|:echo|, |:echon| and |:echomsg| commands.  Also used
			for the |input()| prompt.  Example: >
		:echohl WarningMsg | echo "Don't panic!" | echohl None
<			Don't forget to set the group back to "None",
			otherwise all following echo's will be highlighted.

							*:echom* *:echomsg*
:echom[sg] {expr1} ..	Echo the expression(s) as a true message, saving the
			message in the |message-history|.
			Spaces are placed between the arguments as with the
			|:echo| command.  But unprintable characters are
			displayed, not interpreted.
			The parsing works slightly different from |:echo|,
			more like |:execute|.  All the expressions are first
			evaluated and concatenated before echoing anything.
			The expressions must evaluate to a Number or String, a
			Dictionary or List causes an error.
			Uses the highlighting set by the |:echohl| command.
			Example: >
		:echomsg "It's a Zizzer Zazzer Zuzz, as you can plainly see."
<			See |:echo-redraw| to avoid the message disappearing
			when the screen is redrawn.
							*:echoe* *:echoerr*
:echoe[rr] {expr1} ..	Echo the expression(s) as an error message, saving the
			message in the |message-history|.  When used in a
			script or function the line number will be added.
			Spaces are placed between the arguments as with the
			:echo command.	When used inside a try conditional,
			the message is raised as an error exception instead
			(see |try-echoerr|).
			Example: >
		:echoerr "This script just failed!"
<			If you just want a highlighted message use |:echohl|.
			And to get a beep: >
		:exe "normal \<Esc>"
<
							*:exe* *:execute*
:exe[cute] {expr1} ..	Executes the string that results from the evaluation
			of {expr1} as an Ex command.
			Multiple arguments are concatenated, with a space in
			between.  To avoid the extra space use the "."
			operator to concatenate strings into one argument.
			{expr1} is used as the processed command, command line
			editing keys are not recognized.
			Cannot be followed by a comment.
			Examples: >
		:execute "buffer" nextbuf
		:execute "normal" count . "w"
<
			":execute" can be used to append a command to commands
			that don't accept a '|'.  Example: >
		:execute '!ls' | echo "theend"

<			":execute" is also a nice way to avoid having to type
			control characters in a Vim script for a ":normal"
			command: >
		:execute "normal ixxx\<Esc>"
<			This has an <Esc> character, see |expr-string|.

			Be careful to correctly escape special characters in
			file names.  The |fnameescape()| function can be used
			for Vim commands, |shellescape()| for |:!| commands.
			Examples: >
		:execute "e " . fnameescape(filename)
		:execute "!ls " . shellescape(filename, 1)
<
			Note: The executed string may be any command-line, but
			starting or ending "if", "while" and "for" does not
			always work, because when commands are skipped the
			":execute" is not evaluated and Vim loses track of
			where blocks start and end.  Also "break" and
			"continue" should not be inside ":execute".
			This example does not work, because the ":execute" is
			not evaluated and Vim does not see the "while", and
			gives an error for finding an ":endwhile": >
		:if 0
		: execute 'while i > 5'
		:  echo "test"
		: endwhile
		:endif
<
			It is allowed to have a "while" or "if" command
			completely in the executed string: >
		:execute 'while i < 5 | echo i | let i = i + 1 | endwhile'
<

							*:exe-comment*
			":execute", ":echo" and ":echon" cannot be followed by
			a comment directly, because they see the '"' as the
			start of a string.  But, you can use '|' followed by a
			comment.  Example: >
		:echo "foo" | "this is a comment

==============================================================================
8. Exception handling					*exception-handling*

The Vim script language comprises an exception handling feature.  This section
explains how it can be used in a Vim script.

Exceptions may be raised by Vim on an error or on interrupt, see
|catch-errors| and |catch-interrupt|.  You can also explicitly throw an
exception by using the ":throw" command, see |throw-catch|.


TRY CONDITIONALS					*try-conditionals*

Exceptions can be caught or can cause cleanup code to be executed.  You can
use a try conditional to specify catch clauses (that catch exceptions) and/or
a finally clause (to be executed for cleanup).
   A try conditional begins with a |:try| command and ends at the matching
|:endtry| command.  In between, you can use a |:catch| command to start
a catch clause, or a |:finally| command to start a finally clause.  There may
be none or multiple catch clauses, but there is at most one finally clause,
which must not be followed by any catch clauses.  The lines before the catch
clauses and the finally clause is called a try block. >

     :try
     :	...
     :	...				TRY BLOCK
     :	...
     :catch /{pattern}/
     :	...
     :	...				CATCH CLAUSE
     :	...
     :catch /{pattern}/
     :	...
     :	...				CATCH CLAUSE
     :	...
     :finally
     :	...
     :	...				FINALLY CLAUSE
     :	...
     :endtry

The try conditional allows to watch code for exceptions and to take the
appropriate actions.  Exceptions from the try block may be caught.  Exceptions
from the try block and also the catch clauses may cause cleanup actions.
   When no exception is thrown during execution of the try block, the control
is transferred to the finally clause, if present.  After its execution, the
script continues with the line following the ":endtry".
   When an exception occurs during execution of the try block, the remaining
lines in the try block are skipped.  The exception is matched against the
patterns specified as arguments to the ":catch" commands.  The catch clause
after the first matching ":catch" is taken, other catch clauses are not
executed.  The catch clause ends when the next ":catch", ":finally", or
":endtry" command is reached - whatever is first.  Then, the finally clause
(if present) is executed.  When the ":endtry" is reached, the script execution
continues in the following line as usual.
   When an exception that does not match any of the patterns specified by the
":catch" commands is thrown in the try block, the exception is not caught by
that try conditional and none of the catch clauses is executed.  Only the
finally clause, if present, is taken.  The exception pends during execution of
the finally clause.  It is resumed at the ":endtry", so that commands after
the ":endtry" are not executed and the exception might be caught elsewhere,
see |try-nesting|.
   When during execution of a catch clause another exception is thrown, the
remaining lines in that catch clause are not executed.	The new exception is
not matched against the patterns in any of the ":catch" commands of the same
try conditional and none of its catch clauses is taken.  If there is, however,
a finally clause, it is executed, and the exception pends during its
execution.  The commands following the ":endtry" are not executed.  The new
exception might, however, be caught elsewhere, see |try-nesting|.
   When during execution of the finally clause (if present) an exception is
thrown, the remaining lines in the finally clause are skipped.	If the finally
clause has been taken because of an exception from the try block or one of the
catch clauses, the original (pending) exception is discarded.  The commands
following the ":endtry" are not executed, and the exception from the finally
clause is propagated and can be caught elsewhere, see |try-nesting|.

The finally clause is also executed, when a ":break" or ":continue" for
a ":while" loop enclosing the complete try conditional is executed from the
try block or a catch clause.  Or when a ":return" or ":finish" is executed
from the try block or a catch clause of a try conditional in a function or
sourced script, respectively.  The ":break", ":continue", ":return", or
":finish" pends during execution of the finally clause and is resumed when the
":endtry" is reached.  It is, however, discarded when an exception is thrown
from the finally clause.
   When a ":break" or ":continue" for a ":while" loop enclosing the complete
try conditional or when a ":return" or ":finish" is encountered in the finally
clause, the rest of the finally clause is skipped, and the ":break",
":continue", ":return" or ":finish" is executed as usual.  If the finally
clause has been taken because of an exception or an earlier ":break",
":continue", ":return", or ":finish" from the try block or a catch clause,
this pending exception or command is discarded.

For examples see |throw-catch| and |try-finally|.


NESTING	OF TRY CONDITIONALS				*try-nesting*

Try conditionals can be nested arbitrarily.  That is, a complete try
conditional can be put into the try block, a catch clause, or the finally
clause of another try conditional.  If the inner try conditional does not
catch an exception thrown in its try block or throws a new exception from one
of its catch clauses or its finally clause, the outer try conditional is
checked according to the rules above.  If the inner try conditional is in the
try block of the outer try conditional, its catch clauses are checked, but
otherwise only the finally clause is executed.	It does not matter for
nesting, whether the inner try conditional is directly contained in the outer
one, or whether the outer one sources a script or calls a function containing
the inner try conditional.

When none of the active try conditionals catches an exception, just their
finally clauses are executed.  Thereafter, the script processing terminates.
An error message is displayed in case of an uncaught exception explicitly
thrown by a ":throw" command.  For uncaught error and interrupt exceptions
implicitly raised by Vim, the error message(s) or interrupt message are shown
as usual.

For examples see |throw-catch|.


EXAMINING EXCEPTION HANDLING CODE			*except-examine*

Exception handling code can get tricky.  If you are in doubt what happens, set
'verbose' to 13 or use the ":13verbose" command modifier when sourcing your
script file.  Then you see when an exception is thrown, discarded, caught, or
finished.  When using a verbosity level of at least 14, things pending in
a finally clause are also shown.  This information is also given in debug mode
(see |debug-scripts|).


THROWING AND CATCHING EXCEPTIONS			*throw-catch*

You can throw any number or string as an exception.  Use the |:throw| command
and pass the value to be thrown as argument: >
	:throw 4711
	:throw "string"
<							*throw-expression*
You can also specify an expression argument.  The expression is then evaluated
first, and the result is thrown: >
	:throw 4705 + strlen("string")
	:throw strpart("strings", 0, 6)

An exception might be thrown during evaluation of the argument of the ":throw"
command.  Unless it is caught there, the expression evaluation is abandoned.
The ":throw" command then does not throw a new exception.
   Example: >

	:function! Foo(arg)
	:  try
	:    throw a:arg
	:  catch /foo/
	:  endtry
	:  return 1
	:endfunction
	:
	:function! Bar()
	:  echo "in Bar"
	:  return 4710
	:endfunction
	:
	:throw Foo("arrgh") + Bar()

This throws "arrgh", and "in Bar" is not displayed since Bar() is not
executed. >
	:throw Foo("foo") + Bar()
however displays "in Bar" and throws 4711.

Any other command that takes an expression as argument might also be
abandoned by an (uncaught) exception during the expression evaluation.	The
exception is then propagated to the caller of the command.
   Example: >

	:if Foo("arrgh")
	:  echo "then"
	:else
	:  echo "else"
	:endif

Here neither of "then" or "else" is displayed.

							*catch-order*
Exceptions can be caught by a try conditional with one or more |:catch|
commands, see |try-conditionals|.   The values to be caught by each ":catch"
command can be specified as a pattern argument.  The subsequent catch clause
gets executed when a matching exception is caught.
   Example: >

	:function! Foo(value)
	:  try
	:    throw a:value
	:  catch /^\d\+$/
	:    echo "Number thrown"
	:  catch /.*/
	:    echo "String thrown"
	:  endtry
	:endfunction
	:
	:call Foo(0x1267)
	:call Foo('string')

The first call to Foo() displays "Number thrown", the second "String thrown".
An exception is matched against the ":catch" commands in the order they are
specified.  Only the first match counts.  So you should place the more
specific ":catch" first.  The following order does not make sense: >

	:  catch /.*/
	:    echo "String thrown"
	:  catch /^\d\+$/
	:    echo "Number thrown"

The first ":catch" here matches always, so that the second catch clause is
never taken.

							*throw-variables*
If you catch an exception by a general pattern, you may access the exact value
in the variable |v:exception|: >

	:  catch /^\d\+$/
	:    echo "Number thrown.  Value is" v:exception

You may also be interested where an exception was thrown.  This is stored in
|v:throwpoint|.  Note that "v:exception" and "v:throwpoint" are valid for the
exception most recently caught as long it is not finished.
   Example: >

	:function! Caught()
	:  if v:exception != ""
	:    echo 'Caught "' . v:exception . '" in ' . v:throwpoint
	:  else
	:    echo 'Nothing caught'
	:  endif
	:endfunction
	:
	:function! Foo()
	:  try
	:    try
	:      try
	:	 throw 4711
	:      finally
	:	 call Caught()
	:      endtry
	:    catch /.*/
	:      call Caught()
	:      throw "oops"
	:    endtry
	:  catch /.*/
	:    call Caught()
	:  finally
	:    call Caught()
	:  endtry
	:endfunction
	:
	:call Foo()

This displays >

	Nothing caught
	Caught "4711" in function Foo, line 4
	Caught "oops" in function Foo, line 10
	Nothing caught

A practical example:  The following command ":LineNumber" displays the line
number in the script or function where it has been used: >

	:function! LineNumber()
	:    return substitute(v:throwpoint, '.*\D\(\d\+\).*', '\1', "")
	:endfunction
	:command! LineNumber try | throw "" | catch | echo LineNumber() | endtry
<
							*try-nested*
An exception that is not caught by a try conditional can be caught by
a surrounding try conditional: >

	:try
	:  try
	:    throw "foo"
	:  catch /foobar/
	:    echo "foobar"
	:  finally
	:    echo "inner finally"
	:  endtry
	:catch /foo/
	:  echo "foo"
	:endtry

The inner try conditional does not catch the exception, just its finally
clause is executed.  The exception is then caught by the outer try
conditional.  The example displays "inner finally" and then "foo".

							*throw-from-catch*
You can catch an exception and throw a new one to be caught elsewhere from the
catch clause: >

	:function! Foo()
	:  throw "foo"
	:endfunction
	:
	:function! Bar()
	:  try
	:    call Foo()
	:  catch /foo/
	:    echo "Caught foo, throw bar"
	:    throw "bar"
	:  endtry
	:endfunction
	:
	:try
	:  call Bar()
	:catch /.*/
	:  echo "Caught" v:exception
	:endtry

This displays "Caught foo, throw bar" and then "Caught bar".

							*rethrow*
There is no real rethrow in the Vim script language, but you may throw
"v:exception" instead: >

	:function! Bar()
	:  try
	:    call Foo()
	:  catch /.*/
	:    echo "Rethrow" v:exception
	:    throw v:exception
	:  endtry
	:endfunction
<							*try-echoerr*
Note that this method cannot be used to "rethrow" Vim error or interrupt
exceptions, because it is not possible to fake Vim internal exceptions.
Trying so causes an error exception.  You should throw your own exception
denoting the situation.  If you want to cause a Vim error exception containing
the original error exception value, you can use the |:echoerr| command: >

	:try
	:  try
	:    asdf
	:  catch /.*/
	:    echoerr v:exception
	:  endtry
	:catch /.*/
	:  echo v:exception
	:endtry

This code displays

	Vim(echoerr):Vim:E492: Not an editor command:	asdf ~


CLEANUP CODE						*try-finally*

Scripts often change global settings and restore them at their end.  If the
user however interrupts the script by pressing CTRL-C, the settings remain in
an inconsistent state.	The same may happen to you in the development phase of
a script when an error occurs or you explicitly throw an exception without
catching it.  You can solve these problems by using a try conditional with
a finally clause for restoring the settings.  Its execution is guaranteed on
normal control flow, on error, on an explicit ":throw", and on interrupt.
(Note that errors and interrupts from inside the try conditional are converted
to exceptions.	When not caught, they terminate the script after the finally
clause has been executed.)
Example: >

	:try
	:  let s:saved_ts = &ts
	:  set ts=17
	:
	:  " Do the hard work here.
	:
	:finally
	:  let &ts = s:saved_ts
	:  unlet s:saved_ts
	:endtry

This method should be used locally whenever a function or part of a script
changes global settings which need to be restored on failure or normal exit of
that function or script part.

							*break-finally*
Cleanup code works also when the try block or a catch clause is left by
a ":continue", ":break", ":return", or ":finish".
   Example: >

	:let first = 1
	:while 1
	:  try
	:    if first
	:      echo "first"
	:      let first = 0
	:      continue
	:    else
	:      throw "second"
	:    endif
	:  catch /.*/
	:    echo v:exception
	:    break
	:  finally
	:    echo "cleanup"
	:  endtry
	:  echo "still in while"
	:endwhile
	:echo "end"

This displays "first", "cleanup", "second", "cleanup", and "end". >

	:function! Foo()
	:  try
	:    return 4711
	:  finally
	:    echo "cleanup\n"
	:  endtry
	:  echo "Foo still active"
	:endfunction
	:
	:echo Foo() "returned by Foo"

This displays "cleanup" and "4711 returned by Foo".  You don't need to add an
extra ":return" in the finally clause.	(Above all, this would override the
return value.)

							*except-from-finally*
Using either of ":continue", ":break", ":return", ":finish", or ":throw" in
a finally clause is possible, but not recommended since it abandons the
cleanup actions for the try conditional.  But, of course, interrupt and error
exceptions might get raised from a finally clause.
   Example where an error in the finally clause stops an interrupt from
working correctly: >

	:try
	:  try
	:    echo "Press CTRL-C for interrupt"
	:    while 1
	:    endwhile
	:  finally
	:    unlet novar
	:  endtry
	:catch /novar/
	:endtry
	:echo "Script still running"
	:sleep 1

If you need to put commands that could fail into a finally clause, you should
think about catching or ignoring the errors in these commands, see
|catch-errors| and |ignore-errors|.


CATCHING ERRORS						*catch-errors*

If you want to catch specific errors, you just have to put the code to be
watched in a try block and add a catch clause for the error message.  The
presence of the try conditional causes all errors to be converted to an
exception.  No message is displayed and |v:errmsg| is not set then.  To find
the right pattern for the ":catch" command, you have to know how the format of
the error exception is.
   Error exceptions have the following format: >

	Vim({cmdname}):{errmsg}
or >
	Vim:{errmsg}

{cmdname} is the name of the command that failed; the second form is used when
the command name is not known.	{errmsg} is the error message usually produced
when the error occurs outside try conditionals.  It always begins with
a capital "E", followed by a two or three-digit error number, a colon, and
a space.

Examples:

The command >
	:unlet novar
normally produces the error message >
	E108: No such variable: "novar"
which is converted inside try conditionals to an exception >
	Vim(unlet):E108: No such variable: "novar"

The command >
	:dwim
normally produces the error message >
	E492: Not an editor command: dwim
which is converted inside try conditionals to an exception >
	Vim:E492: Not an editor command: dwim

You can catch all ":unlet" errors by a >
	:catch /^Vim(unlet):/
or all errors for misspelled command names by a >
	:catch /^Vim:E492:/

Some error messages may be produced by different commands: >
	:function nofunc
and >
	:delfunction nofunc
both produce the error message >
	E128: Function name must start with a capital: nofunc
which is converted inside try conditionals to an exception >
	Vim(function):E128: Function name must start with a capital: nofunc
or >
	Vim(delfunction):E128: Function name must start with a capital: nofunc
respectively.  You can catch the error by its number independently on the
command that caused it if you use the following pattern: >
	:catch /^Vim(\a\+):E128:/

Some commands like >
	:let x = novar
produce multiple error messages, here: >
	E121: Undefined variable: novar
	E15: Invalid expression:  novar
Only the first is used for the exception value, since it is the most specific
one (see |except-several-errors|).  So you can catch it by >
	:catch /^Vim(\a\+):E121:/

You can catch all errors related to the name "nofunc" by >
	:catch /\<nofunc\>/

You can catch all Vim errors in the ":write" and ":read" commands by >
	:catch /^Vim(\(write\|read\)):E\d\+:/

You can catch all Vim errors by the pattern >
	:catch /^Vim\((\a\+)\)\=:E\d\+:/
<
							*catch-text*
NOTE: You should never catch the error message text itself: >
	:catch /No such variable/
only works in the english locale, but not when the user has selected
a different language by the |:language| command.  It is however helpful to
cite the message text in a comment: >
	:catch /^Vim(\a\+):E108:/   " No such variable


IGNORING ERRORS						*ignore-errors*

You can ignore errors in a specific Vim command by catching them locally: >

	:try
	:  write
	:catch
	:endtry

But you are strongly recommended NOT to use this simple form, since it could
catch more than you want.  With the ":write" command, some autocommands could
be executed and cause errors not related to writing, for instance: >

	:au BufWritePre * unlet novar

There could even be such errors you are not responsible for as a script
writer: a user of your script might have defined such autocommands.  You would
then hide the error from the user.
   It is much better to use >

	:try
	:  write
	:catch /^Vim(write):/
	:endtry

which only catches real write errors.  So catch only what you'd like to ignore
intentionally.

For a single command that does not cause execution of autocommands, you could
even suppress the conversion of errors to exceptions by the ":silent!"
command: >
	:silent! nunmap k
This works also when a try conditional is active.


CATCHING INTERRUPTS					*catch-interrupt*

When there are active try conditionals, an interrupt (CTRL-C) is converted to
the exception "Vim:Interrupt".	You can catch it like every exception.	The
script is not terminated, then.
   Example: >

	:function! TASK1()
	:  sleep 10
	:endfunction

	:function! TASK2()
	:  sleep 20
	:endfunction

	:while 1
	:  let command = input("Type a command: ")
	:  try
	:    if command == ""
	:      continue
	:    elseif command == "END"
	:      break
	:    elseif command == "TASK1"
	:      call TASK1()
	:    elseif command == "TASK2"
	:      call TASK2()
	:    else
	:      echo "\nIllegal command:" command
	:      continue
	:    endif
	:  catch /^Vim:Interrupt$/
	:    echo "\nCommand interrupted"
	:    " Caught the interrupt.  Continue with next prompt.
	:  endtry
	:endwhile

You can interrupt a task here by pressing CTRL-C; the script then asks for
a new command.	If you press CTRL-C at the prompt, the script is terminated.

For testing what happens when CTRL-C would be pressed on a specific line in
your script, use the debug mode and execute the |>quit| or |>interrupt|
command on that line.  See |debug-scripts|.


CATCHING ALL						*catch-all*

The commands >

	:catch /.*/
	:catch //
	:catch

catch everything, error exceptions, interrupt exceptions and exceptions
explicitly thrown by the |:throw| command.  This is useful at the top level of
a script in order to catch unexpected things.
   Example: >

	:try
	:
	:  " do the hard work here
	:
	:catch /MyException/
	:
	:  " handle known problem
	:
	:catch /^Vim:Interrupt$/
	:    echo "Script interrupted"
	:catch /.*/
	:  echo "Internal error (" . v:exception . ")"
	:  echo " - occurred at " . v:throwpoint
	:endtry
	:" end of script

Note: Catching all might catch more things than you want.  Thus, you are
strongly encouraged to catch only for problems that you can really handle by
specifying a pattern argument to the ":catch".
   Example: Catching all could make it nearly impossible to interrupt a script
by pressing CTRL-C: >

	:while 1
	:  try
	:    sleep 1
	:  catch

EXCEPTIONS AND AUTOCOMMANDS				*except-autocmd*

Exceptions may be used during execution of autocommands.  Example: >

	:autocmd User x try
	:autocmd User x   throw "Oops!"
	:autocmd User x catch
	:autocmd User x   echo v:exception
	:autocmd User x endtry
	:autocmd User x throw "Arrgh!"
	:autocmd User x echo "Should not be displayed"
	:
	:try
	:  doautocmd User x
	:catch
	:  echo v:exception
	:endtry

This displays "Oops!" and "Arrgh!".

							*except-autocmd-Pre*
For some commands, autocommands get executed before the main action of the
command takes place.  If an exception is thrown and not caught in the sequence
of autocommands, the sequence and the command that caused its execution are
abandoned and the exception is propagated to the caller of the command.
   Example: >

	:autocmd BufWritePre * throw "FAIL"
	:autocmd BufWritePre * echo "Should not be displayed"
	:
	:try
	:  write
	:catch
	:  echo "Caught:" v:exception "from" v:throwpoint
	:endtry

Here, the ":write" command does not write the file currently being edited (as
you can see by checking 'modified'), since the exception from the BufWritePre
autocommand abandons the ":write".  The exception is then caught and the
script displays: >

	Caught: FAIL from BufWrite Auto commands for "*"
<
							*except-autocmd-Post*
For some commands, autocommands get executed after the main action of the
command has taken place.  If this main action fails and the command is inside
an active try conditional, the autocommands are skipped and an error exception
is thrown that can be caught by the caller of the command.
   Example: >

	:autocmd BufWritePost * echo "File successfully written!"
	:
	:try
	:  write /i/m/p/o/s/s/i/b/l/e
	:catch
	:  echo v:exception
	:endtry

This just displays: >

	Vim(write):E212: Can't open file for writing (/i/m/p/o/s/s/i/b/l/e)

If you really need to execute the autocommands even when the main action
fails, trigger the event from the catch clause.
   Example: >

	:autocmd BufWritePre  * set noreadonly
	:autocmd BufWritePost * set readonly
	:
	:try
	:  write /i/m/p/o/s/s/i/b/l/e
	:catch
	:  doautocmd BufWritePost /i/m/p/o/s/s/i/b/l/e
	:endtry
<
You can also use ":silent!": >

	:let x = "ok"
	:let v:errmsg = ""
	:autocmd BufWritePost * if v:errmsg != ""
	:autocmd BufWritePost *   let x = "after fail"
	:autocmd BufWritePost * endif
	:try
	:  silent! write /i/m/p/o/s/s/i/b/l/e
	:catch
	:endtry
	:echo x

This displays "after fail".

If the main action of the command does not fail, exceptions from the
autocommands will be catchable by the caller of the command:  >

	:autocmd BufWritePost * throw ":-("
	:autocmd BufWritePost * echo "Should not be displayed"
	:
	:try
	:  write
	:catch
	:  echo v:exception
	:endtry
<
							*except-autocmd-Cmd*
For some commands, the normal action can be replaced by a sequence of
autocommands.  Exceptions from that sequence will be catchable by the caller
of the command.
   Example:  For the ":write" command, the caller cannot know whether the file
had actually been written when the exception occurred.	You need to tell it in
some way. >

	:if !exists("cnt")
	:  let cnt = 0
	:
	:  autocmd BufWriteCmd * if &modified
	:  autocmd BufWriteCmd *   let cnt = cnt + 1
	:  autocmd BufWriteCmd *   if cnt % 3 == 2
	:  autocmd BufWriteCmd *     throw "BufWriteCmdError"
	:  autocmd BufWriteCmd *   endif
	:  autocmd BufWriteCmd *   write | set nomodified
	:  autocmd BufWriteCmd *   if cnt % 3 == 0
	:  autocmd BufWriteCmd *     throw "BufWriteCmdError"
	:  autocmd BufWriteCmd *   endif
	:  autocmd BufWriteCmd *   echo "File successfully written!"
	:  autocmd BufWriteCmd * endif
	:endif
	:
	:try
	:	write
	:catch /^BufWriteCmdError$/
	:  if &modified
	:    echo "Error on writing (file contents not changed)"
	:  else
	:    echo "Error after writing"
	:  endif
	:catch /^Vim(write):/
	:    echo "Error on writing"
	:endtry

When this script is sourced several times after making changes, it displays
first >
	File successfully written!
then >
	Error on writing (file contents not changed)
then >
	Error after writing
etc.

							*except-autocmd-ill*
You cannot spread a try conditional over autocommands for different events.
The following code is ill-formed: >

	:autocmd BufWritePre  * try
	:
	:autocmd BufWritePost * catch
	:autocmd BufWritePost *   echo v:exception
	:autocmd BufWritePost * endtry
	:
	:write


EXCEPTION HIERARCHIES AND PARAMETERIZED EXCEPTIONS	*except-hier-param*

Some programming languages allow to use hierarchies of exception classes or to
pass additional information with the object of an exception class.  You can do
similar things in Vim.
   In order to throw an exception from a hierarchy, just throw the complete
class name with the components separated by a colon, for instance throw the
string "EXCEPT:MATHERR:OVERFLOW" for an overflow in a mathematical library.
   When you want to pass additional information with your exception class, add
it in parentheses, for instance throw the string "EXCEPT:IO:WRITEERR(myfile)"
for an error when writing "myfile".
   With the appropriate patterns in the ":catch" command, you can catch for
base classes or derived classes of your hierarchy.  Additional information in
parentheses can be cut out from |v:exception| with the ":substitute" command.
   Example: >

	:function! CheckRange(a, func)
	:  if a:a < 0
	:    throw "EXCEPT:MATHERR:RANGE(" . a:func . ")"
	:  endif
	:endfunction
	:
	:function! Add(a, b)
	:  call CheckRange(a:a, "Add")
	:  call CheckRange(a:b, "Add")
	:  let c = a:a + a:b
	:  if c < 0
	:    throw "EXCEPT:MATHERR:OVERFLOW"
	:  endif
	:  return c
	:endfunction
	:
	:function! Div(a, b)
	:  call CheckRange(a:a, "Div")
	:  call CheckRange(a:b, "Div")
	:  if (a:b == 0)
	:    throw "EXCEPT:MATHERR:ZERODIV"
	:  endif
	:  return a:a / a:b
	:endfunction
	:
	:function! Write(file)
	:  try
	:    execute "write" fnameescape(a:file)
	:  catch /^Vim(write):/
	:    throw "EXCEPT:IO(" . getcwd() . ", " . a:file . "):WRITEERR"
	:  endtry
	:endfunction
	:
	:try
	:
	:  " something with arithmetics and I/O
	:
	:catch /^EXCEPT:MATHERR:RANGE/
	:  let function = substitute(v:exception, '.*(\(\a\+\)).*', '\1', "")
	:  echo "Range error in" function
	:
	:catch /^EXCEPT:MATHERR/	" catches OVERFLOW and ZERODIV
	:  echo "Math error"
	:
	:catch /^EXCEPT:IO/
	:  let dir = substitute(v:exception, '.*(\(.\+\),\s*.\+).*', '\1', "")
	:  let file = substitute(v:exception, '.*(.\+,\s*\(.\+\)).*', '\1', "")
	:  if file !~ '^/'
	:    let file = dir . "/" . file
	:  endif
	:  echo 'I/O error for "' . file . '"'
	:
	:catch /^EXCEPT/
	:  echo "Unspecified error"
	:
	:endtry

The exceptions raised by Vim itself (on error or when pressing CTRL-C) use
a flat hierarchy:  they are all in the "Vim" class.  You cannot throw yourself
exceptions with the "Vim" prefix; they are reserved for Vim.
   Vim error exceptions are parameterized with the name of the command that
failed, if known.  See |catch-errors|.


PECULIARITIES
							*except-compat*
The exception handling concept requires that the command sequence causing the
exception is aborted immediately and control is transferred to finally clauses
and/or a catch clause.

In the Vim script language there are cases where scripts and functions
continue after an error: in functions without the "abort" flag or in a command
after ":silent!", control flow goes to the following line, and outside
functions, control flow goes to the line following the outermost ":endwhile"
or ":endif".  On the other hand, errors should be catchable as exceptions
(thus, requiring the immediate abortion).

This problem has been solved by converting errors to exceptions and using
immediate abortion (if not suppressed by ":silent!") only when a try
conditional is active.	This is no restriction since an (error) exception can
be caught only from an active try conditional.	If you want an immediate
termination without catching the error, just use a try conditional without
catch clause.  (You can cause cleanup code being executed before termination
by specifying a finally clause.)

When no try conditional is active, the usual abortion and continuation
behavior is used instead of immediate abortion.  This ensures compatibility of
scripts written for Vim 6.1 and earlier.

However, when sourcing an existing script that does not use exception handling
commands (or when calling one of its functions) from inside an active try
conditional of a new script, you might change the control flow of the existing
script on error.  You get the immediate abortion on error and can catch the
error in the new script.  If however the sourced script suppresses error
messages by using the ":silent!" command (checking for errors by testing
|v:errmsg| if appropriate), its execution path is not changed.	The error is
not converted to an exception.	(See |:silent|.)  So the only remaining cause
where this happens is for scripts that don't care about errors and produce
error messages.  You probably won't want to use such code from your new
scripts.

							*except-syntax-err*
Syntax errors in the exception handling commands are never caught by any of
the ":catch" commands of the try conditional they belong to.  Its finally
clauses, however, is executed.
   Example: >

	:try
	:  try
	:    throw 4711
	:  catch /\(/
	:    echo "in catch with syntax error"
	:  catch
	:    echo "inner catch-all"
	:  finally
	:    echo "inner finally"
	:  endtry
	:catch
	:  echo 'outer catch-all caught "' . v:exception . '"'
	:  finally
	:    echo "outer finally"
	:endtry

This displays: >
    inner finally
    outer catch-all caught "Vim(catch):E54: Unmatched \("
    outer finally
The original exception is discarded and an error exception is raised, instead.

							*except-single-line*
The ":try", ":catch", ":finally", and ":endtry" commands can be put on
a single line, but then syntax errors may make it difficult to recognize the
"catch" line, thus you better avoid this.
   Example: >
	:try | unlet! foo # | catch | endtry
raises an error exception for the trailing characters after the ":unlet!"
argument, but does not see the ":catch" and ":endtry" commands, so that the
error exception is discarded and the "E488: Trailing characters" message gets
displayed.

							*except-several-errors*
When several errors appear in a single command, the first error message is
usually the most specific one and therefor converted to the error exception.
   Example: >
	echo novar
causes >
	E121: Undefined variable: novar
	E15: Invalid expression: novar
The value of the error exception inside try conditionals is: >
	Vim(echo):E121: Undefined variable: novar
<							*except-syntax-error*
But when a syntax error is detected after a normal error in the same command,
the syntax error is used for the exception being thrown.
   Example: >
	unlet novar #
causes >
	E108: No such variable: "novar"
	E488: Trailing characters
The value of the error exception inside try conditionals is: >
	Vim(unlet):E488: Trailing characters
This is done because the syntax error might change the execution path in a way
not intended by the user.  Example: >
	try
	    try | unlet novar # | catch | echo v:exception | endtry
	catch /.*/
	    echo "outer catch:" v:exception
	endtry
This displays "outer catch: Vim(unlet):E488: Trailing characters", and then
a "E600: Missing :endtry" error message is given, see |except-single-line|.

9. Examples						*eval-examples*

Printing in Binary ~
>
  :" The function Nr2Bin() returns the binary string representation of a number.
  :func Nr2Bin(nr)
  :  let n = a:nr
  :  let r = ""
  :  while n
  :    let r = '01'[n % 2] . r
  :    let n = n / 2
  :  endwhile
  :  return r
  :endfunc

  :" The function String2Bin() converts each character in a string to a
  :" binary string, separated with dashes.
  :func String2Bin(str)
  :  let out = ''
  :  for ix in range(strlen(a:str))
  :    let out = out . '-' . Nr2Bin(char2nr(a:str[ix]))
  :  endfor
  :  return out[1:]
  :endfunc

Example of its use: >
  :echo Nr2Bin(32)
result: "100000" >
  :echo String2Bin("32")
result: "110011-110010"


Sorting lines ~

This example sorts lines with a specific compare function. >

  :func SortBuffer()
  :  let lines = getline(1, '$')
  :  call sort(lines, function("Strcmp"))
  :  call setline(1, lines)
  :endfunction

As a one-liner: >
  :call setline(1, sort(getline(1, '$'), function("Strcmp")))


scanf() replacement ~
							*sscanf*
There is no sscanf() function in Vim.  If you need to extract parts from a
line, you can use matchstr() and substitute() to do it.  This example shows
how to get the file name, line number and column number out of a line like
"foobar.txt, 123, 45". >
   :" Set up the match bit
   :let mx='\(\f\+\),\s*\(\d\+\),\s*\(\d\+\)'
   :"get the part matching the whole expression
   :let l = matchstr(line, mx)
   :"get each item out of the match
   :let file = substitute(l, mx, '\1', '')
   :let lnum = substitute(l, mx, '\2', '')
   :let col = substitute(l, mx, '\3', '')

The input is in the variable "line", the results in the variables "file",
"lnum" and "col". (idea from Michael Geddes)


getting the scriptnames in a Dictionary ~
						*scriptnames-dictionary*
The |:scriptnames| command can be used to get a list of all script files that
have been sourced.  There is no equivalent function or variable for this
(because it's rarely needed).  In case you need to manipulate the list this
code can be used: >
    " Get the output of ":scriptnames" in the scriptnames_output variable.
    let scriptnames_output = ''
    redir => scriptnames_output
    silent scriptnames
    redir END
    
    " Split the out
