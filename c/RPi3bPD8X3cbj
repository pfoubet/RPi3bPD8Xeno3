# _AS_PREPARE
# -----------
# This macro has a very special status.  Normal use of M4sh relies
# heavily on AS_REQUIRE, so that needed initializations (such as
# _AS_TEST_PREPARE) are performed on need, not on demand.  But
# Autoconf is the first client of M4sh, and for two reasons: configure
# and config.status.  Relying on AS_REQUIRE is of course fine for
# configure, but fails for config.status (which is created by
# configure).  So we need a means to force the inclusion of the
# various _AS_*_PREPARE on top of config.status.  That's basically why
# there are so many _AS_*_PREPARE below, and that's also why it is
# important not to forget some: config.status needs them.
# List any preparations that create shell functions first, then
# topologically sort the others by their dependencies.
#
# Special case: we do not need _AS_LINENO_PREPARE, because the
# parent will have substituted $LINENO for us when processing its
# own invocation of _AS_LINENO_PREPARE.
#
# Special case: the full definition of _AS_ERROR_PREPARE is not output
# unless AS_MESSAGE_LOG_FD is non-empty, although the value of
# AS_MESSAGE_LOG_FD is not relevant.

# AS_HELP_STRING(LHS, RHS, [INDENT-COLUMN = 26], [WRAP-COLUMN = 79])
# ------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# Format a help string so that it looks pretty when the user executes
# "script --help".  This macro takes up to four arguments, a
# "left hand side" (LHS), a "right hand side" (RHS), a decimal
# INDENT-COLUMN which is the column where wrapped lines should begin
# (the default of 26 is recommended), and a decimal WRAP-COLUMN which is
# the column where lines should wrap (the default of 79 is recommended).
# LHS is expanded, RHS is not.
#
# For backwards compatibility not documented in the manual, INDENT-COLUMN
# can also be specified as a string of white spaces, whose width
# determines the indentation column.  Using TABs in INDENT-COLUMN is not
# recommended, since screen width of TAB is not computed.
#
# The resulting string is suitable for use in other macros that require
# a help string (e.g. AC_ARG_WITH).
#
# Here is the sample string from the Autoconf manual (Node: External
# Software) which shows the proper spacing for help strings.
#
#    --with-readline         support fancy command line editing
#  ^ ^                       ^
#  | |                       |
#  | column 2                column 26
#  |
#  column 0
#
# A help string is made up of a "left hand side" (LHS) and a "right
# hand side" (RHS).  In the example above, the LHS is
# "--with-readline", while the RHS is "support fancy command line
# editing".
#
# If the LHS contains more than (INDENT-COLUMN - 3) characters, then the
# LHS is terminated with a newline so that the RHS starts on a line of its
# own beginning at INDENT-COLUMN.  In the default case, this corresponds to an
# LHS with more than 23 characters.
#
# Therefore, in the example, if the LHS were instead
# "--with-readline-blah-blah-blah", then the AS_HELP_STRING macro would
# expand into:
#
#
#    --with-readline-blah-blah-blah
#  ^ ^                       support fancy command line editing
#  | |                       ^
#  | column 2                |
#  column 0                  column 26

#

# inline its expansion up front.  Only use a regular expression if we
# detect a potential quadrigraph.

# match m4_cr_digit).

# AS_LITERAL_IF(EXPRESSION, IF-LITERAL, IF-NOT-LITERAL,
#               [IF-SIMPLE-REF = IF-NOT-LITERAL])
# -----------------------------------------------------
# If EXPRESSION has no shell indirections ($var or `expr`), expand
# IF-LITERAL, else IF-NOT-LITERAL.  In some cases, IF-NOT-LITERAL
# must be complex to safely deal with ``, while a simpler
# expression IF-SIMPLE-REF can be used if the indirection
# involves only shell variable expansion (as in ${varname}).
#
# EXPRESSION is treated as a literal if it results in the same
# interpretation whether it is unquoted or contained within double
# quotes, with the exception that whitespace is ignored (on the
# assumption that it will be flattened to _).  Therefore, neither `\$'
# nor `a''b' is a literal, since both backslash and single quotes have
# different quoting behavior in the two contexts; and `a*' is not a
# literal, because it has different globbing.  Note, however, that
# while `${a+b}' is neither a literal nor a simple ref, `a+b' is a
# literal.  This macro is an *approximation*: it is possible that
# there are some EXPRESSIONs which the shell would treat as literals,
# but which this macro does not recognize.
#
# Why do we reject EXPRESSION expanding with `[' or `]' as a literal?
# Because AS_TR_SH is MUCH faster if it can use m4_translit on literals
# instead of m4_bpatsubst; but m4_translit is much tougher to do safely
# if `[' is translated.  That, and file globbing matters.
#
# Note that the quadrigraph @S|@ can result in non-literals, but outright
# rejecting all @ would make AC_INIT complain on its bug report address.
#
# We used to use m4_bmatch(m4_quote($1), [[`$]], [$3], [$2]), but
# profiling shows that it is faster to use m4_translit.
#
# Because the translit is stripping quotes, it must also neutralize
# anything that might be in a macro name, as well as comments, commas,
# or unbalanced parentheses.  Valid shell variable characters and
# unambiguous literal characters are deleted (`a.b'), and remaining
# characters are normalized into `$' if they can form simple refs
# (${a}), `+' if they can potentially form literals (a+b), ``' if they
# can interfere with m4 parsing, or left alone otherwise.  If both `$'
# and `+' are left, it is treated as a complex reference (${a+b}),
# even though it could technically be a simple reference (${a}+b).
# _AS_LITERAL_IF_ only has to check for an empty string after removing
# one of the two normalized characters.
#
# Rather than expand m4_defn every time AS_LITERAL_IF is expanded, we
# inline its expansion up front.  _AS_LITERAL_IF expands to the name
# of a macro that takes three arguments: IF-SIMPLE-REF,
# IF-NOT-LITERAL, IF-LITERAL.  It also takes an optional argument of
# any additional characters to allow as literals (useful for AS_TR_SH
# and AS_TR_CPP to perform inline conversion of whitespace to _).  The
# order of the arguments allows reuse of m4_default.

## ------------------------------------------------------ ##


# The purpose of this section is to provide a uniform API for

# Typically, one can write
#   AS_VAR_SET(var, val)
# or
#   AS_VAR_SET(as_$var, val)
# and expect the right thing to happen.  In the descriptions below,
# a literal name matches the regex [a-zA-Z_][a-zA-Z0-9_]*, an
# indirect name is a shell expression that produces a literal name
# when passed through eval, and a polymorphic name is either type.


# _AS_VAR_APPEND_PREPARE

# Sometimes we may have to handle literals (e.g. `stdlib.h'), while at
# other moments, the same code may have to get the value from a
# variable (e.g., `ac_header').  To have a uniform handling of both
# cases, when a new value is about to be processed, declare a local
# variable, e.g.:
#
#   AS_VAR_PUSHDEF([header], [ac_cv_header_$1])
#
# and then in the body of the macro, use `header' as is.  It is of
# first importance to use `AS_VAR_*' to access this variable.
#
# If the value `$1' was a literal (e.g. `stdlib.h'), then `header' is
# in fact the value `ac_cv_header_stdlib_h'.  If `$1' was indirect,
# then `header's value in m4 is in fact `$as_header', the shell
# variable that holds all of the magic to get the expansion right.
#

# too many people forget to quote the first argument of m4_define.
#
# For instance in the following case:
#   m4_define(foo, [bar])
# then a second reading will turn into
#   m4_define(bar, [bar])
# which is certainly not what was meant.

## 5. Additional branching constructs.  ##
## ------------------------------------ ##

# Both `m4_ifval' and `m4_ifset' tests against the empty string.  The
# difference is that `m4_ifset' is specialized on macros.
#
# In case of arguments of macros, eg. $1, it makes little difference.
# In the case of a macro `FOO', you don't want to check `m4_ifval(FOO,
# TRUE)', because if `FOO' expands with commas, there is a shifting of
# the arguments.  So you want to run `m4_ifval([FOO])', but then you just
# compare the *string* `FOO' against `', which, of course fails.
#
# So you want the variation `m4_ifset' that expects a macro name as $1.
# If this macro is both defined and defined to a non empty value, then
# it runs TRUE, etc.


# m4_ifblank(COND, [IF-BLANK], [IF-TEXT])

# then expand IF-BLANK, otherwise expand IF-TEXT.  This differs from
# m4_ifval only if COND has just whitespace, but it helps optimize in
# spite of users who mistakenly leave trailing space after what they
# thought was an empty argument:
#   macro(

# ----------------

# Similar to m4_if, except that each TEST is expanded when encountered.
# If the expansion of TESTn matches the string VALn, the result is IF-VALn.
# The result is DEFAULT if no tests passed.  This macro allows
# short-circuiting of expensive tests, where it pays to arrange quick
# filter tests to run first.
#
# For an example, consider a previous implementation of _AS_QUOTE_IFELSE:
#
#    m4_if(m4_index([$1], [\]), [-1], [$2],
#          m4_eval(m4_index([$1], [\\]) >= 0), [1], [$2],

#          [$2])
#
# Here, m4_index is computed 5 times, and m4_eval 4, even if $1 contains
# no backslash.  It is more efficient to do:

#    m4_cond([m4_index([$1], [\])], [-1], [$2],

# m4_expand(ARG)
# _m4_expand(ARG)
# ---------------
# Return the expansion of ARG as a single string.  Unlike

#   => ACT, IVE, ACT, IVE
#
# Unfortunately, due to limitations in m4, ARG must expand to
# something with balanced quotes (use quadrigraphs to get around
# this), and should not contain the unlikely delimiters -=<{( or
# )}>=-.  It is possible to have unbalanced quoted `(' or `)', as well
# as unbalanced unquoted `)'.  m4_expand can handle unterminated
# comments or dnl on the final line, at the expense of speed; it also
# aids in detecting attempts to incorrectly change the current
# diversion inside ARG.  Meanwhile, _m4_expand is faster but must be
# given a terminated expansion, and has no safety checks for
# mis-diverted text.
#
# Exploit that extra unquoted () will group unquoted commas and the
# following whitespace.  m4_bpatsubst can't handle newlines inside $1,
# and m4_substr strips quoting.  So we (ab)use m4_changequote, using
# temporary quotes to remove the delimiters that conveniently included
# the unquoted () that were added prior to the changequote.
#
# Thanks to shell case statements, too many people are prone to pass
# underquoted `)', so we try to detect that by passing a marker as a
# fourth argument; if the marker is not present, then we assume that
# we encountered an early `)', and re-expand the first argument, but
# this time with one more `(' in the second argument and in the
# open-quote delimiter.  We must also ignore the slop from the

# m4_unquote(ARGS)
# ----------------
# Remove one layer of quotes from each ARG, performing one level of
# expansion.  For one argument, m4_unquote([arg]) is more efficient than

		 [$0(m4_eval([$1 + $3]), [$2], [$3], [$4], [$5])])])


# Implementing `foreach' loops in m4 is much more tricky than it may
# seem.  For example, the old M4 1.4.4 manual had an incorrect example,
# which looked like this (when translated to m4sugar):
#
# | # foreach(VAR, (LIST), STMT)
# | m4_define([foreach],
# |   [m4_pushdef([$1])_foreach([$1], [$2], [$3])m4_popdef([$1])])
# | m4_define([_arg1], [$1])
# | m4_define([_foreach],
# |   [m4_if([$2], [()], ,
# |     [m4_define([$1], _arg1$2)$3[]_foreach([$1], (m4_shift$2), [$3])])])
#
# But then if you run
#
# | m4_define(a, 1)
# | m4_define(b, 2)
# | m4_define(c, 3)
# | foreach([f], [([a], [(b], [c)])], [echo f
# | ])
#
# it gives
#
#  => echo 1
#  => echo (2,3)
#
# which is not what is expected.
#
# Of course the problem is that many quotes are missing.  So you add
# plenty of quotes at random places, until you reach the expected
# result.  Alternatively, if you are a quoting wizard, you directly
# reach the following implementation (but if you really did, then
# apply to the maintenance of m4sugar!).
#
# | # foreach(VAR, (LIST), STMT)
# | m4_define([foreach], [m4_pushdef([$1])_foreach($@)m4_popdef([$1])])
# | m4_define([_arg1], [[$1]])
# | m4_define([_foreach],
# |  [m4_if($2, [()], ,
# |    [m4_define([$1], [_arg1$2])$3[]_foreach([$1], [(m4_shift$2)], [$3])])])
#
# which this time answers
#
#  => echo a
#  => echo (b
#  => echo c)
#
# Bingo!
#
# Well, not quite.
#
# With a better look, you realize that the parens are more a pain than
# a help: since anyway you need to quote properly the list, you end up
# with always using an outermost pair of parens and an outermost pair
# of quotes.  Rejecting the parens both eases the implementation, and
# simplifies the use:
#
# | # foreach(VAR, (LIST), STMT)
# | m4_define([foreach], [m4_pushdef([$1])_foreach($@)m4_popdef([$1])])
# | m4_define([_arg1], [$1])
# | m4_define([_foreach],
# |  [m4_if($2, [], ,
# |    [m4_define([$1], [_arg1($2)])$3[]_foreach([$1], [m4_shift($2)], [$3])])])
#
#
# Now, just replace the `$2' with `m4_quote($2)' in the outer `m4_if'
# to improve robustness, and you come up with a nice implementation
# that doesn't require extra parentheses in the user's LIST.
#
# But wait -  now the algorithm is quadratic, because every recursion of
# the algorithm keeps the entire LIST and merely adds another m4_shift to
# the quoted text.  If the user has a lot of elements in LIST, you can
# bring the system to its knees with the memory m4 then requires, or trip
# the m4 --nesting-limit recursion factor.  The only way to avoid
# quadratic growth is ensure m4_shift is expanded prior to the recursion.
# Hence the design below.
#
# The M4 manual now includes a chapter devoted to this issue, with
# the lessons learned from m4sugar.  And still, this design is only
# optimal for M4 1.6; see foreach.m4 for yet more comments on why
# M4 1.4.x uses yet another implementation.


# m4_foreach(VARIABLE, LIST, EXPRESSION)
# --------------------------------------
#
# Expand EXPRESSION assigning each value of the LIST to VARIABLE.
# LIST should have the form `item_1, item_2, ..., item_n', i.e. the
# whole list must *quoted*.  Quote members too if you don't want them
# to be expanded.
#
# This macro is robust to active symbols:
#      | m4_define(active, [ACT, IVE])
#      | m4_foreach(Var, [active, active], [-Var-])
#     => -ACT--IVE--ACT--IVE-

#
#      | m4_foreach(Var, [[[active]], [[active]]], [-Var-])
#     => -active--active-
#
# This macro is called frequently, so avoid extra expansions such as
# m4_ifval and dnl.  Also, since $2 might be quite large, try to use it
# as little as possible in _m4_foreach; each extra use requires that much
# more memory for expansion.  So, rather than directly compare $2 against
# [] and use m4_car/m4_cdr for recursion, we instead unbox the list (which
# requires swapping the argument order in the helper), insert an ignored
# third argument, and use m4_shift3 to detect when recursion is complete,
# at which point this looks very much like m4_map_args.

## 10. Defining macros with bells and whistles.  ##
## --------------------------------------------- ##

# `m4_defun' is basically `m4_define' but it equips the macro with the
# needed machinery for `m4_require'.  A macro must be m4_defun'd if
# either it is m4_require'd, or it m4_require's.
#
# Two things deserve attention and are detailed below:
#  1. Implementation of m4_require
#  2. Keeping track of the expansion stack
#
# 1. Implementation of m4_require
# ===============================
#
# Of course m4_defun calls m4_provide, so that a macro which has
# been expanded is not expanded again when m4_require'd, but the
# difficult part is the proper expansion of macros when they are
# m4_require'd.
#
# The implementation is based on three ideas, (i) using diversions to
# prepare the expansion of the macro and its dependencies (by Franc,ois
# Pinard), (ii) expand the most recently m4_require'd macros _after_
# the previous macros (by Axel Thimm), and (iii) track instances of
# provide before require (by Eric Blake).
#
#
# The first idea: why use diversions?
# -----------------------------------
#
# When a macro requires another, the other macro is expanded in new
# diversion, GROW.  When the outer macro is fully expanded, we first
# undivert the most nested diversions (GROW - 1...), and finally
# undivert GROW.  To understand why we need several diversions,
# consider the following example:
#
# | m4_defun([TEST1], [Test...m4_require([TEST2])1])
# | m4_defun([TEST2], [Test...m4_require([TEST3])2])
# | m4_defun([TEST3], [Test...3])
#
# Because m4_require is not required to be first in the outer macros, we
# must keep the expansions of the various levels of m4_require separated.
# Right before executing the epilogue of TEST1, we have:
#
#	   GROW - 2: Test...3
#	   GROW - 1: Test...2
#	   GROW:     Test...1
#	   BODY:
#
# Finally the epilogue of TEST1 undiverts GROW - 2, GROW - 1, and
# GROW into the regular flow, BODY.
#
#	   GROW - 2:
#	   GROW - 1:
#	   GROW:
#	   BODY:        Test...3; Test...2; Test...1
#
# (The semicolons are here for clarification, but of course are not
# emitted.)  This is what Autoconf 2.0 (I think) to 2.13 (I'm sure)
# implement.
#
#
# The second idea: first required first out
# -----------------------------------------
#
# The natural implementation of the idea above is buggy and produces
# very surprising results in some situations.  Let's consider the
# following example to explain the bug:
#
# | m4_defun([TEST1],  [m4_require([TEST2a])m4_require([TEST2b])])
# | m4_defun([TEST2a], [])
# | m4_defun([TEST2b], [m4_require([TEST3])])
# | m4_defun([TEST3],  [m4_require([TEST2a])])
# |
# | AC_INIT
# | TEST1
#
# The dependencies between the macros are:
#
#		 3 --- 2b
#		/        \              is m4_require'd by
#	       /          \       left -------------------- right
#	    2a ------------ 1
#
# If you strictly apply the rules given in the previous section you get:
#
#	   GROW - 2: TEST3
#	   GROW - 1: TEST2a; TEST2b
#	   GROW:     TEST1
#	   BODY:
#
# (TEST2a, although required by TEST3 is not expanded in GROW - 3
# because is has already been expanded before in GROW - 1, so it has
# been AC_PROVIDE'd, so it is not expanded again) so when you undivert
# the stack of diversions, you get:
#
#	   GROW - 2:
#	   GROW - 1:
#	   GROW:
#	   BODY:        TEST3; TEST2a; TEST2b; TEST1
#
# i.e., TEST2a is expanded after TEST3 although the latter required the
# former.
#
# Starting from 2.50, we use an implementation provided by Axel Thimm.
# The idea is simple: the order in which macros are emitted must be the
# same as the one in which macros are expanded.  (The bug above can
# indeed be described as: a macro has been m4_provide'd before its
# dependent, but it is emitted after: the lack of correlation between
# emission and expansion order is guilty).
#
# How to do that?  You keep the stack of diversions to elaborate the
# macros, but each time a macro is fully expanded, emit it immediately.
#
# In the example above, when TEST2a is expanded, but it's epilogue is
# not run yet, you have:
#
#	   GROW - 2:
#	   GROW - 1: TEST2a
#	   GROW:     Elaboration of TEST1
#	   BODY:
#
# The epilogue of TEST2a emits it immediately:
#
#	   GROW - 2:
#	   GROW - 1:
#	   GROW:     Elaboration of TEST1
#	   BODY:     TEST2a
#
# TEST2b then requires TEST3, so right before the epilogue of TEST3, you
# have:
#
#	   GROW - 2: TEST3
#	   GROW - 1: Elaboration of TEST2b
#	   GROW:     Elaboration of TEST1
#	   BODY:      TEST2a
#
# The epilogue of TEST3 emits it:
#
#	   GROW - 2:
#	   GROW - 1: Elaboration of TEST2b
#	   GROW:     Elaboration of TEST1
#	   BODY:     TEST2a; TEST3
#
# TEST2b is now completely expanded, and emitted:
#
#	   GROW - 2:
#	   GROW - 1:
#	   GROW:     Elaboration of TEST1
#	   BODY:     TEST2a; TEST3; TEST2b
#
# and finally, TEST1 is finished and emitted:
#
#	   GROW - 2:
#	   GROW - 1:
#	   GROW:
#	   BODY:     TEST2a; TEST3; TEST2b: TEST1
#
# The idea is simple, but the implementation is a bit involved.  If
# you are like me, you will want to see the actual functioning of this
# implementation to be convinced.  The next section gives the full
# details.
#
#
# The Axel Thimm implementation at work
# -------------------------------------
#
# We consider the macros above, and this configure.ac:
#
#	    AC_INIT
#	    TEST1
#
# You should keep the definitions of _m4_defun_pro, _m4_defun_epi, and
# m4_require at hand to follow the steps.
#
# This implementation tries not to assume that the current diversion is
# BODY, so as soon as a macro (m4_defun'd) is expanded, we first
# record the current diversion under the name _m4_divert_dump (denoted
# DUMP below for short).  This introduces an important difference with
# the previous versions of Autoconf: you cannot use m4_require if you
# are not inside an m4_defun'd macro, and especially, you cannot
# m4_require directly from the top level.
#
# We have not tried to simulate the old behavior (better yet, we
# diagnose it), because it is too dangerous: a macro m4_require'd from
# the top level is expanded before the body of `configure', i.e., before
# any other test was run.  I let you imagine the result of requiring
# AC_STDC_HEADERS for instance, before AC_PROG_CC was actually run....
#
# After AC_INIT was run, the current diversion is BODY.
# * AC_INIT was run
#   DUMP:                undefined
#   diversion stack:     BODY |-
#
# * TEST1 is expanded
# The prologue of TEST1 sets _m4_divert_dump, which is the diversion
# where the current elaboration will be dumped, to the current
# diversion.  It also m4_divert_push to GROW, where the full
# expansion of TEST1 and its dependencies will be elaborated.
#   DUMP:        BODY
#   BODY:        empty
#   diversions:  GROW, BODY |-
#
# * TEST1 requires TEST2a
# _m4_require_call m4_divert_pushes another temporary diversion,
# GROW - 1, and expands TEST2a in there.
#   DUMP:        BODY
#   BODY:        empty
#   GROW - 1:    TEST2a
#   diversions:  GROW - 1, GROW, BODY |-
# Then the content of the temporary diversion is moved to DUMP and the
# temporary diversion is popped.
#   DUMP:        BODY
#   BODY:        TEST2a
#   diversions:  GROW, BODY |-
#
# * TEST1 requires TEST2b
# Again, _m4_require_call pushes GROW - 1 and heads to expand TEST2b.
#   DUMP:        BODY
#   BODY:        TEST2a
#   diversions:  GROW - 1, GROW, BODY |-
#
# * TEST2b requires TEST3
# _m4_require_call pushes GROW - 2 and expands TEST3 here.
# (TEST3 requires TEST2a, but TEST2a has already been m4_provide'd, so
# nothing happens.)
#   DUMP:        BODY
#   BODY:        TEST2a
#   GROW - 2:    TEST3
#   diversions:  GROW - 2, GROW - 1, GROW, BODY |-
# Then the diversion is appended to DUMP, and popped.
#   DUMP:        BODY
#   BODY:        TEST2a; TEST3
#   diversions:  GROW - 1, GROW, BODY |-
#
# * TEST1 requires TEST2b (contd.)
# The content of TEST2b is expanded...
#   DUMP:        BODY
#   BODY:        TEST2a; TEST3
#   GROW - 1:    TEST2b,
#   diversions:  GROW - 1, GROW, BODY |-
# ... and moved to DUMP.
#   DUMP:        BODY
#   BODY:        TEST2a; TEST3; TEST2b
#   diversions:  GROW, BODY |-
#
# * TEST1 is expanded: epilogue
# TEST1's own content is in GROW...
#   DUMP:        BODY
#   BODY:        TEST2a; TEST3; TEST2b
#   GROW:        TEST1
#   diversions:  BODY |-
# ... and it's epilogue moves it to DUMP and then undefines DUMP.
#   DUMP:       undefined
#   BODY:       TEST2a; TEST3; TEST2b; TEST1
#   diversions: BODY |-
#
#
# The third idea: track macros provided before they were required
# ---------------------------------------------------------------
#
# Using just the first two ideas, Autoconf 2.50 through 2.63 still had
# a subtle bug for more than seven years.  Let's consider the
# following example to explain the bug:
#
# | m4_defun([TEST1], [1])
# | m4_defun([TEST2], [2[]m4_require([TEST1])])
# | m4_defun([TEST3], [3 TEST1 m4_require([TEST2])])
# | TEST3
#
# After the prologue of TEST3, we are collecting text in GROW with the
# intent of dumping it in BODY during the epilogue.  Next, we
# encounter the direct invocation of TEST1, which provides the macro
# in place in GROW.  From there, we encounter a requirement for TEST2,
# which must be collected in a new diversion.  While expanding TEST2,
# we encounter a requirement for TEST1, but since it has already been
# expanded, the Axel Thimm algorithm states that we can treat it as a
# no-op.  But that would lead to an end result of `2 3 1', meaning
# that we have once again output a macro (TEST2) prior to its
# requirements (TEST1).
#
# The problem can only occur if a single defun'd macro first provides,
# then later indirectly requires, the same macro.  Note that directly
# expanding then requiring a macro is okay: because the dependency was
# met, the require phase can be a no-op.  For that matter, the outer
# macro can even require two helpers, where the first helper expands
# the macro, and the second helper indirectly requires the macro.
# Out-of-order expansion is only present if the inner macro is
# required by something that will be hoisted in front of where the
# direct expansion occurred.  In other words, we must be careful not
# to warn on:
#
# | m4_defun([TEST4], [4])
# | m4_defun([TEST5], [5 TEST4 m4_require([TEST4])])
# | TEST5 => 5 4
#
# or even the more complex:
#
# | m4_defun([TEST6], [6])
# | m4_defun([TEST7], [7 TEST6])
# | m4_defun([TEST8], [8 m4_require([TEST6])])
# | m4_defun([TEST9], [9 m4_require([TEST8])])
# | m4_defun([TEST10], [10 m4_require([TEST7]) m4_require([TEST9])])
# | TEST10 => 7 6 8 9 10
#
# So, to detect whether a require was direct or indirect, m4_defun and
# m4_require track the name of the macro that caused a diversion to be
# created (using the stack _m4_diverting, coupled with an O(1) lookup
# _m4_diverting([NAME])), and m4_provide stores the name associated
# with the diversion at which a macro was provided.  A require call is
# direct if it occurs within the same diversion where the macro was
# provided, or if the diversion associated with the providing context
# has been collected.
#
# The implementation of the warning involves tracking the set of
# macros which have been provided since the start of the outermost
# defun'd macro (the set is named _m4_provide).  When starting an
# outermost macro, the set is emptied; when a macro is provided, it is
# added to the set; when require expands the body of a macro, it is
# removed from the set; and when a macro is indirectly required, the
# set is checked.  If a macro is in the set, then it has been provided
# before it was required, and we satisfy dependencies by expanding the
# macro as if it had never been provided; in the example given above,
# this means we now output `1 2 3 1'.  Meanwhile, a warning is issued
# to inform the user that her macros trigger the bug in older autoconf
# versions, and that her output file now contains redundant contents
# (and possibly new problems, if the repeated macro was not
# idempotent).  Meanwhile, macros defined by m4_defun_once instead of
# m4_defun are idempotent, avoiding any warning or duplicate output.
#
#
# 2. Keeping track of the expansion stack
# =======================================
#
# When M4 expansion goes wrong it is often extremely hard to find the
# path amongst macros that drove to the failure.  What is needed is
# the stack of macro `calls'. One could imagine that GNU M4 would
# maintain a stack of macro expansions, unfortunately it doesn't, so
# we do it by hand.  This is of course extremely costly, but the help
# this stack provides is worth it.  Nevertheless to limit the
# performance penalty this is implemented only for m4_defun'd macros,
# not for define'd macros.
#
# Each time we enter an m4_defun'd macros, we add a definition in
# _m4_expansion_stack, and when we exit the macro, we remove it (thanks
# to pushdef/popdef).  m4_stack_foreach is used to print the expansion
# stack in the rare cases when it's needed.
#
# In addition, we want to detect circular m4_require dependencies.
# Each time we expand a macro FOO we define _m4_expanding(FOO); and
# m4_require(BAR) simply checks whether _m4_expanding(BAR) is defined.


# m4_expansion_stack
# ------------------
# Expands to the entire contents of the expansion stack.  The caller
# must supply a trailing newline.  This macro always prints a
# location; check whether _m4_expansion_stack is defined to filter out
# the case when no defun'd macro is in force.
m4_define([m4_expansion_stack],
[m4_stack_foreach_sep_lifo([_$0], [_$0_entry(], [)
])m4_location[: the top level]])

# _m4_expansion_stack_entry(MACRO)
# --------------------------------
# Format an entry for MACRO found on the expansion stack.
m4_define([_m4_expansion_stack_entry],
[_m4_defn([m4_location($1)])[: $1 is expanded from...]])

# m4_expansion_stack_push(MACRO)
# ------------------------------
# Form an entry of the expansion stack on entry to MACRO and push it.
m4_define([m4_expansion_stack_push],
[m4_pushdef([_m4_expansion_stack], [$1])])


# _m4_divert(GROW)
# ----------------
# This diversion is used by the m4_defun/m4_require machinery.  It is
# important to keep room before GROW because for each nested
# AC_REQUIRE we use an additional diversion (i.e., two m4_require's
# will use GROW - 2.  More than 3 levels has never seemed to be
# needed.)
#
# ...
# - GROW - 2
#   m4_require'd code, 2 level deep
# - GROW - 1

# In this case, once finished, it will bring back all the code

# achieves the topological ordering of macros.  We don't use this
# macro to define some frequently called macros that are not involved
# in ordering constraints, to save m4 processing.
#
# MACRO is an undocumented argument; when set to m4_pushdef, and NAME
# is already defined, the new definition is added to the pushdef
# stack, rather than overwriting the current definition.  It can thus

# previously m4_define'd definition so that subsequent use of the

# For now, the COMMON definition is always m4_define'd, giving an even

# a macro is provided, m4_require no longer cares if it is m4_define'd
# or m4_defun'd.  m4_defun also provides location tracking to identify
# dependency bugs, but once the INIT has been expanded, we know there
# are no dependency bugs.  However, if a future use needs COMMON to be

#     m4_require([AC_PROG_CC], [AC_PROG_CC])

#
# - BODY-TO-EXPAND == m4_indir([NAME-TO-CHECK])
#   In the case of macros with irregular names.  For instance:
#     m4_require([AC_LANG_COMPILER(C)], [indir([AC_LANG_COMPILER(C)])])
#   which means `if the macro named `AC_LANG_COMPILER(C)' (the parens are

#   call it.'
#   Had you used

#   call the macro `AC_LANG_COMPILER' with `C' as argument.
#
#   You could argue that `AC_LANG_COMPILER', when it receives an argument
#   such as `C' should dispatch the call to `AC_LANG_COMPILER(C)'.  But this

## 15. Set handling.  ##
## ------------------ ##

# Autoconf likes to create arbitrarily large sets; for example, as of
# this writing, the configure.ac for coreutils tracks a set of more
# than 400 AC_SUBST.  How do we track all of these set members,
# without introducing duplicates?  We could use m4_append_uniq, with
# the set NAME residing in the contents of the macro NAME.
# Unfortunately, m4_append_uniq is quadratic for set creation, because
# it costs O(n) to search the string for each of O(n) insertions; not
# to mention that with m4 1.4.x, even using m4_append is slow, costing
# O(n) rather than O(1) per insertion.  Other set operations, not used
# by Autoconf but still possible by manipulation of the definition
# tracked in macro NAME, include O(n) deletion of one element and O(n)
# computation of set size.  Because the set is exposed to the user via
# the definition of a single macro, we cannot cache any data about the
# set without risking the cache being invalidated by the user
# redefining NAME.
#
# Can we do better?  Yes, because m4 gives us an O(1) search function
# for free: ifdef.  Additionally, even m4 1.4.x gives us an O(1)
# insert operation for free: pushdef.  But to use these, we must
# represent the set via a group of macros; to keep the set consistent,
# we must hide the set so that the user can only manipulate it through
# accessor macros.  The contents of the set are maintained through two
# access points; _m4_set([name]) is a pushdef stack of values in the
# set, useful for O(n) traversal of the set contents; while the
# existence of _m4_set([name],value) with no particular value is
# useful for O(1) querying of set membership.  And since the user
# cannot externally manipulate the set, we are free to add additional
# caching macros for other performance improvements.  Deletion can be
# O(1) per element rather than O(n), by reworking the definition of
# _m4_set([name],value) to be 0 or 1 based on current membership, and
# adding _m4_set_cleanup(name) to defer the O(n) cleanup of
# _m4_set([name]) until we have another reason to do an O(n)
# traversal.  The existence of _m4_set_cleanup(name) can then be used
# elsewhere to determine if we must dereference _m4_set([name],value),
# or assume that definition implies set membership.  Finally, size can
# be tracked in an O(1) fashion with _m4_set_size(name).
#
# The quoting in _m4_set([name],value) is chosen so that there is no
# ambiguity with a set whose name contains a comma, and so that we can
# supply the value via _m4_defn([_m4_set([name])]) without needing any
# quote manipulation.

# addition, and IF-DUP if it is already in the set.  Addition of one
# element is O(1), such that overall set creation is O(n).

# unpruned element, but it is just as easy to check existence directly
# as it is to query _m4_set_cleanup($1).

# Implement two recursion helpers; the check variant is slower but

\`configure' configures m4_ifset([AC_PACKAGE_STRING],
			[AC_PACKAGE_STRING],
			[this package]) to adapt to many kinds of systems.

Usage: $[0] [[OPTION]]... [[VAR=VALUE]]...

[To assign environment variables (e.g., CC, CFLAGS...), specify them as
VAR=VALUE.  See below for descriptions of some of the useful variables.

Defaults for the options are specified in brackets.

Configuration:
  -h, --help              display this help and exit
      --help=short        display options specific to this package
      --help=recursive    display the short help of all the included packages
  -V, --version           display version information and exit
  -q, --quiet, --silent   do not print \`checking ...' messages
      --cache-file=FILE   cache test results in FILE [disabled]
  -C, --config-cache      alias for \`--cache-file=config.cache'
  -n, --no-create         do not create output files
      --srcdir=DIR        find the sources in DIR [configure dir or \`..']

Installation directories:
]AS_HELP_STRING([--prefix=PREFIX],
  [install architecture-independent files in PREFIX [$ac_default_prefix]])
AS_HELP_STRING([--exec-prefix=EPREFIX],
  [install architecture-dependent files in EPREFIX [PREFIX]])[

By default, \`make install' will install all the files in
\`$ac_default_prefix/bin', \`$ac_default_prefix/lib' etc.  You can specify
an installation prefix other than \`$ac_default_prefix' using \`--prefix',
for instance \`--prefix=\$HOME'.

For better control, use the options below.

Fine tuning of the installation directories:
  --bindir=DIR            user executables [EPREFIX/bin]
  --sbindir=DIR           system admin executables [EPREFIX/sbin]
  --libexecdir=DIR        program executables [EPREFIX/libexec]

dnl Initialize an awk array of substitutions, keyed by variable name.
dnl
dnl The initial line contains the variable name VAR, then a `!'.
dnl Construct `S["VAR"]=' from it.
dnl The rest of the line, and potentially further lines, contain the
dnl substituted value; the last of those ends with $ac_delim.  We split
dnl the output both along those substituted newlines and at intervals of
dnl length _AC_AWK_LITERAL_LIMIT.  The latter is done to comply with awk
dnl string literal limitations, the former for simplicity in doing so.
dnl
dnl We deal with one input line at a time to avoid sed pattern space
dnl limitations.  We kill the delimiter $ac_delim before splitting the
dnl string (otherwise we risk splitting the delimiter).  And we do the
dnl splitting before the quoting of awk special characters (otherwise we
dnl risk splitting an escape sequence).
dnl
dnl Output as separate string literals, joined with backslash-newline.
dnl Eliminate the newline after `=' in a second script, for readability.
dnl
dnl Notes to the main part of the awk script:
dnl - the unusual FS value helps prevent running into the limit of 99 fields,
dnl - we avoid sub/gsub because of the \& quoting issues, see
dnl   http://www.gnu.org/software/gawk/manual/html_node/Gory-Details.html
dnl - Writing `$ 0' prevents expansion by both the shell and m4 here.
dnl
dnl m4-double-quote most of the scripting for readability.

dnl		behavior for C library functions.  This is not wanted here,

/* Thanks to Mike Haertel and Jim Avera for this test.
   Here is a matrix of mmap possibilities:
	mmap private not fixed
	mmap private fixed at somewhere currently unmapped
	mmap private fixed at somewhere already mapped
	mmap shared not fixed
	mmap shared fixed at somewhere currently unmapped
	mmap shared fixed at somewhere already mapped
   For private mappings, we should verify that changes cannot be read()
   back from the file, nor mmap's back from the file at a different
   address.  (There have been systems where private was not correctly
   implemented like the infamous i386 svr4.0, and systems where the
   VM page cache was not coherent with the file system buffer cache
   like early versions of FreeBSD and possibly contemporary NetBSD.)
   For shared mappings, we should conversely verify that changes get
   propagated back to all the places they're supposed to be.

   Grep wants private fixed already mapped.
   The main things grep needs to know about mmap are:
   * does it exist and is it safe to write into the mmap'd area
   * how to use it (BSD variants)  */

\`configure' configures m4_ifset([AC_PACKAGE_STRING],
			[AC_PACKAGE_STRING],
			[this package]) to adapt to many kinds of systems.

Usage: $[0] [[OPTION]]... [[VAR=VALUE]]...

[To assign environment variables (e.g., CC, CFLAGS...), specify them as
VAR=VALUE.  See below for descriptions of some of the useful variables.

Defaults for the options are specified in brackets.

Configuration:
  -h, --help              display this help and exit
      --help=short        display options specific to this package
      --help=recursive    display the short help of all the included packages
  -V, --version           display version information and exit
  -q, --quiet, --silent   do not print \`checking ...' messages
      --cache-file=FILE   cache test results in FILE [disabled]
  -C, --config-cache      alias for \`--cache-file=config.cache'
  -n, --no-create         do not create output files
      --srcdir=DIR        find the sources in DIR [configure dir or \`..']

Installation directories:
]AS_HELP_STRING([--prefix=PREFIX],
  [install architecture-independent files in PREFIX [$ac_default_prefix]])
AS_HELP_STRING([--exec-prefix=EPREFIX],
  [install architecture-dependent files in EPREFIX [PREFIX]])[

By default, \`make install' will install all the files in
\`$ac_default_prefix/bin', \`$ac_default_prefix/lib' etc.  You can specify
an installation prefix other than \`$ac_default_prefix' using \`--prefix',
for instance \`--prefix=\$HOME'.

For better control, use the options below.

Fine tuning of the installation directories:
  --bindir=DIR            user executables [EPREFIX/bin]
  --sbindir=DIR           system admin executables [EPREFIX/sbin]
  --libexecdir=DIR        program executables [EPREFIX/libexec]

# Preprocessed Fortran 77

# passing "$(DEFS) $(DEFAULT_INCLUDES) $(INCLUDES) $(AM_CPPFLAGS)
# $(CPPFLAGS)" as additional flags to the Fortran 77 compiler, since
# this is how GNU Make does it; see the "GNU Make Manual, Edition 0.51
# for 'make' Version 3.76 Beta" (specifically, from info file
# '(make)Catalogue of Rules').
#
# A better approach would be to write an Autoconf test
# (i.e. AC_PROG_FPP) for a Fortran 77 preprocessor, because not all
# Fortran 77 compilers know how to do preprocessing.  The Autoconf
# macro AC_PROG_FPP should test the Fortran 77 compiler first for
# preprocessing capabilities, and then fall back on cpp (if cpp were
# available).

At least a source file is in a subdirectory, but the 'subdir-objects'
automake option hasn't been enabled.  For now, the corresponding output
object file(s) will be placed in the top-level directory.  However,
this behaviour will change in future Automake versions: they will
unconditionally cause object files to be placed in the same subdirectory
of the corresponding sources.
You are advised to start using 'subdir-objects' option throughout your
project, to avoid future incompatibilities.

      # non-distributed .info files, and non-distributed .texi
      # files.
      #
      # * Non-distributed .texi files is important in some packages
      #   where .texi files are built at make time, probably using
      #   other binaries built in the package itself, maybe using
      #   tools or information found on the build host.  Because
      #   these files are not distributed they are always rebuilt
      #   at make time; they should therefore not lie in the source
      #   directory.  One plan was to support this using
      #   nodist_info_TEXINFOS or something similar.  (Doing this
      #   requires some sanity checks.  For instance Automake should
      #   not allow:
      #      dist_info_TEXINFOS = foo.texi
      #      nodist_foo_TEXINFOS = included.texi
      #   because a distributed file should never depend on a
      #   non-distributed file.)
      #
      # * If .texi files are not distributed, then .info files should
      #   not be distributed either.  There are also cases where one
      #   wants to distribute .texi files, but does not want to
      #   distribute the .info files.  For instance the Texinfo package
      #   distributes the tool used to build these files; it would
      #   be a waste of space to distribute them.  It's not clear
      #   which syntax we should use to indicate that .info files should
      #   not be distributed.  Akim Demaille suggested that eventually
      #   we switch to a new syntax:
      #   |  Maybe we should take some inspiration from what's already
      #   |  done in the rest of Automake.  Maybe there is too much
      #   |  syntactic sugar here, and you want
      #   |     nodist_INFO = bar.info
      #   |     dist_bar_info_SOURCES = bar.texi
      #   |     bar_texi_DEPENDENCIES = foo.texi
      #   |  with a bit of magic to have bar.info represent the whole
      #   |  bar*info set.  That's a lot more verbose that the current
      #   |  situation, but it is # not new, hence the user has less
      #   |  to learn.
      #	  |
      #   |  But there is still too much room for meaningless specs:
      #   |     nodist_INFO = bar.info
      #   |     dist_bar_info_SOURCES = bar.texi
      #   |     dist_PS = bar.ps something-written-by-hand.ps
      #   |     nodist_bar_ps_SOURCES = bar.texi
      #   |     bar_texi_DEPENDENCIES = foo.texi

      # Back to the point, it should be clear that in order to support
      # non-distributed .info files, we need to build them in the
      # build tree, not in the source tree (non-distributed .texi
      # files are less of a problem, because we do not output build
      # rules for them).  In Automake 1.7 .info build rules have been
      # largely cleaned up so that .info files get always build in the
      # build tree, even when distributed.  The idea was that
      #   (1) if during a VPATH build the .info file was found to be
      #       absent or out-of-date (in the source tree or in the
      #       build tree), Make would rebuild it in the build tree.
      #       If an up-to-date source-tree of the .info file existed,
      #       make would not rebuild it in the build tree.
      #   (2) having two copies of .info files, one in the source tree
      #       and one (newer) in the build tree is not a problem
      #       because 'make dist' always pick files in the build tree
      #       first.
      # However it turned out the be a bad idea for several reasons:
      #   * Tru64, OpenBSD, and FreeBSD (not NetBSD) Make do not behave
      #     like GNU Make on point (1) above.  These implementations
      #     of Make would always rebuild .info files in the build
      #     tree, even if such files were up to date in the source
      #     tree.  Consequently, it was impossible to perform a VPATH
      #     build of a package containing Texinfo files using these
      #     Make implementations.
      #     (Refer to the Autoconf Manual, section "Limitation of
      #     Make", paragraph "VPATH", item "target lookup", for
      #     an account of the differences between these
      #     implementations.)
      #   * The GNU Coding Standards require these files to be built
      #     in the source-tree (when they are distributed, that is).
      #   * Keeping a fresher copy of distributed files in the
      #     build tree can be annoying during development because
      #     - if the files is kept under CVS, you really want it
      #       to be updated in the source tree
      #     - it is confusing that 'make distclean' does not erase
      #       all files in the build tree.
      #
      # Consequently, starting with Automake 1.8, .info files are
      # built in the source tree again.  Because we still plan to
      # support non-distributed .info files at some point, we
      # have a single variable ($INSRC) that controls whether
      # the current .info file must be built in the source tree
      # or in the build tree.  Actually this variable is switched
      # off in two cases:
      #  (1) For '.info' files that appear to be cleaned; this is for
      #      backward compatibility with package such as Texinfo,
      #      which do things like
      #        info_TEXINFOS = texinfo.txi info-stnd.texi info.texi
      #        DISTCLEANFILES = texinfo texinfo-* info*.info*
      #        # Do not create info files for distribution.
      #        dist-info:
      #      in order not to distribute .info files.
      #  (2) When the undocumented option 'info-in-builddir' is given.
      #      This is done to allow the developers of GCC, GDB, GNU
      #      binutils and the GNU bfd library to force the '.info' files
      #      to be generated in the builddir rather than the srcdir, as
      #      was once done when the (now removed) 'cygnus' option was
      #      given.  See automake bug#11034 for more discussion.

Oops!
    It appears this file (or files included by it) are triggering
    an undocumented, soon-to-be-removed automake hack.
    Future automake versions will no longer place in the builddir
    (rather than in the srcdir) the generated '.info' files that
    appear to be cleaned, by e.g. being listed in CLEANFILES or
    DISTCLEANFILES.
    If you want your '.info' files to be placed in the builddir
    rather than in the srcdir, you have to use the shiny new
    'info-in-builddir' automake option.
