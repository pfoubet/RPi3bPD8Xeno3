/* Gconvert:
 *	This preprocessor macro is defined to convert a floating point
 *	number to a string without a trailing decimal point.  This
 *	emulates the behavior of sprintf("%g"), but is sometimes much more
 *	efficient.  If gconvert() is not available, but gcvt() drops the
 *	trailing decimal point, then gcvt() is used.  If all else fails,
 *	a macro using sprintf("%g") is used. Arguments for the Gconvert
 *	macro are: value, number of digits, whether trailing zeros should
 *	be retained, and the output buffer.
 *	The usual values are:
 *		d_Gconvert='gconvert((x),(n),(t),(b))'
 *		d_Gconvert='gcvt((x),(n),(b))'
 *		d_Gconvert='sprintf((b),"%.*g",(n),(x))'
 *	The last two assume trailing zeros should not be kept.

/* Use PERL_UNUSED_RESULT() to suppress the warnings about unused results

 *
 * The main reason for this is that the combination of gcc -Wunused-result
 * (part of -Wall) and the __attribute__((warn_unused_result)) cannot
 * be silenced with casting to void.  This causes trouble when the system
 * header files use the attribute.
 *
 * Use PERL_UNUSED_RESULT sparingly, though, since usually the warning
 * is there for a good reason: you might lose success/failure information,
 * or leak resources, or changes in resources.
 *
 * But sometimes you just want to ignore the return value, e.g. on
 * codepaths soon ending up in abort, or in "best effort" attempts,
 * or in situations where there is no good way to handle failures.
 *
 * Sometimes PERL_UNUSED_RESULT might not be the most natural way:
 * another possibility is that you can capture the return value
 * and use PERL_UNUSED_VAR on that.
 *
 * The __typeof__() is used instead of typeof() since typeof() is not
 * available under strict C89, and because of compilers masquerading

    Process macros in FILEs.  If no FILE or if FILE is `-', standard input
is read.
    
Mandatory or optional arguments to long options are mandatory or optional
for short options too.

Operation modes:
      --help                   display this help and exit
      --version                output version information and exit
     -E, --fatal-warnings         once: warnings become errors, twice: stop
                                 execution at first error
  -i, --interactive            unbuffer output, ignore interrupts
  -P, --prefix-builtins        force a `m4_' prefix to all builtins
  -Q, --quiet, --silent        suppress some warnings for builtins
      --warn-macro-sequence[=REGEXP]
                               warn if macro definition matches REGEXP,

   \$\({[^}]*}\|[0-9][0-9]+\)  
Preprocessor features:
  -D, --define=NAME[=VALUE]    define NAME as having VALUE, or empty
  -I, --include=DIRECTORY      append DIRECTORY to include path
  -s, --synclines              generate `#line NUM "FILE"' lines
  -U, --undefine=NAME          undefine NAME
 Limits control:
  -g, --gnu                    override -G to re-enable GNU extensions
  -G, --traditional            suppress all GNU extensions
  -H, --hashsize=PRIME         set symbol lookup hash table size [509]
  -L, --nesting-limit=NUMBER   change nesting limit, 0 for unlimited [%d]
 Frozen state files:
  -F, --freeze-state=FILE      produce a frozen state on FILE at end
  -R, --reload-state=FILE      reload a frozen state from FILE at start
   
Debugging:
  -d, --debug[=FLAGS]          set debug level (no FLAGS implies `aeq')
      --debugfile[=FILE]       redirect debug and trace output to FILE
                                 (default stderr, discard if empty string)
  -l, --arglength=NUM          restrict macro tracing size
  -t, --trace=NAME             trace NAME when it is defined
  
FLAGS is any of:
  a   show actual arguments
  c   show before collect, after collect and after call
  e   show expansion
  f   say current input file name
  i   show changes in input files
  l   say current input line number
  p   show results of path searches
  q   quote values as necessary, with a or e flag
  t   trace for all macro calls, not only traceon'ed
  x   add a unique macro call id, useful with c flag
  V   shorthand for all of the above flags
  
If defined, the environment variable `M4PATH' is a colon-separated list
of directories included after any specified by `-I'.
  
Exit status is 0 for success, 1 for failure, 63 for frozen file version
mismatch, or whatever value was passed to the m4exit macro.
