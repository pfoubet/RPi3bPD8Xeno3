Description: configuration for the Exim MTA (v4)
 Exim (v4) is a mail transport agent. exim4-config provides the configuration
 for the exim4 daemon packages. The configuration framework has been split
 off the main package to allow sites to replace the configuration scheme
 with their own without having to change the actual exim4 packages.
 .
 Sites with special configuration needs (having a lot of identically
 configured machines for example) can use this to distribute their own
 custom configuration via the packaging system, using the magic
 available with dpkg's conffile handling, without having to do local
 changes on all of these machines.

Description: generic tool for pairwise sequence comparison
 Exonerate allows you to align sequences using a many alignment models, using
 either exhaustive dynamic programming, or a variety of heuristics. Much of
 the functionality of the Wise dynamic programming suite was reimplemented in C
 for better efficiency. Exonerate is an intrinsic component of the building of
 the Ensembl genome databases, providing similarity scores between RNA and DNA
 sequences and thus determining splice variants and coding sequences in
 general.
 .
 An In-silico PCR Experiment Simulation System (see the ipcress man page) is
 packaged with exonerate.

Description: Increase selected region in Emacs by semantic units
 Expand region increases the selected region by semantic units.  Just
 keep pressing the 'C-=' key until it selects what you want.
 The notion of "semantic" is language-sensitive.
 .
 Example: editing
 .
 (setq alphabet-start "abc def")
 .
 With the cursor at the `c`, it starts by marking the entire word
 `abc`, then expand to the contents of the quotes `abc def`, then to
 the entire quote `"abc def"`, then to the contents of the sexp `setq
 alphabet-start "abc def"` and finally to the entire sexp.

Description: Automates interactive applications
 Expect is a tool for automating interactive applications according to a script.
 Following the script, Expect knows what can be expected from a program and what
 the correct response should be. Expect is also useful for testing these same
 applications. And by adding Tk, you can also wrap interactive applications in
 X11 GUIs. An interpreted language provides branching and high-level control
 structures to direct the dialogue. In addition, the user can take control and
 interact directly when desired, afterward returning control to the script.
 .
 This package contains the expect binary and several Expect based scripts.

Description: recover deleted files from ext3 or ext4 partitions
 ext4magic is a file carver (or file carving). It can be used when recovering
 from disasters or in digital forensics activities.
 .
 The deletion of files in ext3/4 filesystems can not be easily reversed. Zero
 out of the block references in the inodes makes that impossible. Experiences
 with other programs have proved that is possible restore sufficient information
 for a recover of many data files, directly from the filesystem journal.
 .
 ext4magic can extract the information from the journal and restore files in an
 entire directory tree, if the information in the journal are sufficient.
 .
 This tool can recover the most file types, with orginal filename, owner and
 group, file mode bits and also the old atime/mtime stamps.

Description: Extra modules and scripts for CMake
 Extra CMake Modules, or ECM, aims to augment CMake with additional modules. It
 serves as both a staging ground for new modules before they are moved upstream
 to CMake and a place for modules that, for whatever reason, are not a good fit
 for CMake itself.
 .
 It is primarily driven by the needs of the KDE community, but it is hoped that
 other projects will find it useful, and outside contributions are always
 welcome. The main rule for new modules is that there must be at least two
 downstream users.

 A typical use is to allow e-mail to be piped via ssh to external servers
 running a full sendmail-compatible MTA. extsmail is designed to have
 sensible defaults, and configuring it is a one-off, quick job.

Description: collect and display facts about the system
 A cross-platform Ruby library for retrieving facts from operating systems.
 Supports multiple resolution mechanisms, any of which can be restricted to
 working only on certain operating systems or environments. Facter is
 especially useful for retrieving things like operating system names, IP
 addresses, MAC addresses, and SSH keys.
 .
 It is easy to extend Facter to include your own custom facts or to include
 additional mechanisms for retrieving facts.

Description: toolset to rip audiostreams, cut, fade in/out and tag the resulting audiofiles
 fadecut is a script to rip audio files from a livestream and to process them
 automatically. Beginning and ending fo the audio files will be cut and faded
 in/out. So logos and advertising of radio stations will be automatically
 removed.
 .
 In streaming mode fadecut is ripping audio files using streamripper. The
 downloaded audio files are cutted using silence detection and then faded in
 and out. Subsequently, the files are encoded to either ogg or mp3 and tagged
 with tags (title, artist, genre and comment provided).
 .
 In file mode fadecut is just processing already ripped audio files.
 .
 An audio file which has already been processed is detected and will not be
 processed again. Not desired songs can be stored in a separate directory. This
 files are not processed anymore too.

 (sshd, apache, qmail, proftpd, sasl etc.) but configuration can be
 easily extended for monitoring any other text file.  All filters and
 actions are given in the config files, thus fail2ban can be adopted
 to be used with a variety of files and firewalls.

MD5sum: dd2a96d4636783fd3c5bce8493e578a9
Description: Memory allocation failure crash-test tool
 The idea behind failmalloc is to demonstrate what really happens if
 memory allocation fails. Unfortunately, most programs in this world are
 not robust, mostly because programmers are careless, but sometimes because
 programmers are too brave. Regardless of whatever reasons, the most
 critical problem is in that there is no good way to see such failures
 in reality, until a program is deployed into a heavy production system.
 Clearly, this is too late!
 .
 Failmalloc addresses this problem. Failmalloc inserts hooks into your
 program, which induces always, often or sometimes failures of memory
 allocation calls. The functions malloc, realloc and memalign are hooked,
 but other functions which use one of these functions are also affected.

Description: high availability load balancer for TCP connections
 Fair is a system for implementing load balancers; it consists of two daemons:
 carrousel and transponder. Carrousel, which performs load balancing services,
 typically runs on a load balancer; transponder runs on the servers.
 .
 Fair understands network topologies where one node is reachable via more than
 one IP address; this allows not only the servers, but the network to be
 redundant as well. This distinguishes fair from other load balancers.

Description: Save/restore system clock on machines without working RTC hardware
 Some machines don't have a working realtime clock (RTC) unit, or no
 driver for the hardware that does exist. fake-hwclock is a simple set
 of scripts to save the kernel's current clock periodically (including
 at shutdown) and restore it at boot so that the system clock keeps at
 least close to realtime. This will stop some of the problems that may
 be caused by a system believing it has travelled in time back to
 1970, such as needing to perform filesystem checks at every boot.
 .
 On top of this, use of NTP is still recommended to deal with the fake
 clock "drifting" while the hardware is halted or rebooting.

Description: fake pop3 daemon. delivers same messages to all users
 fakepop is a fake pop3 daemon. It returns always the same messages
 to all users, it does not care about usernames and passwords. All
 user/pass combinations are accepted.
 .
 The main purpose of fakepop is to advice users that your server
 only accepts pop3-ssl and they have wrongly configured pop3 without
 ssl. You can customize messages in /etc/fakepop/ directory to teach
 your users how they should configure their mail clients to use
 pop3-ssl instead of pop3.
 .
 WARNING: some pop3-ssl daemons require a pop3 non-ssl package to be
 installed. That is why fakepop does not conflicts with pop3-server.
 courier-pop-ssl is one of these packages (it requires courier-pop).
 Before installing fakepop, be sure to disable other pop3 daemons.
 For courier, set POP3DSTART=NO in /etc/courier/pop3d

Description: tool for simulating superuser privileges
 fakeroot provides a fake "root environment" by means of LD_PRELOAD and
 SysV IPC (or TCP) trickery. It puts wrappers around getuid(), chown(),
 stat(), and other file-manipulation functions, so that unprivileged
 users can (for instance) populate .deb archives with root-owned files;
 various build tools use fakeroot for this by default.
 .
 This package contains fakeroot command and the daemon that remembers
 fake ownership/permissions of files manipulated by fakeroot
 processes.

Description: report faked system time to programs
 The Fake Time Preload Library (FTPL, a.k.a. libfaketime) intercepts
 various system calls which programs use to retrieve the current date
 and time. It can then report faked dates and times (as specified by
 you, the user) to these programs. This means you can modify the
 system time a program sees without having to change the time
 system-wide. FTPL allows you to specify both absolute dates (e.g.,
 2004-01-01) and relative dates (e.g., 10 days ago).

Description: File Alteration Monitor
 FAM monitors files and directories, notifying interested applications
 of changes.
 .
 This package provides a server that can monitor a given list of files
 and notify applications through a socket.  If the kernel supports
 dnotify (kernels >= 2.4.x) FAM is notified directly by the kernel.
 Otherwise it has to poll the files' status.  FAM can also provide an
 RPC service for monitoring remote files (such as on a mounted NFS
 filesystem).

Description: Tool for construction of phylogenetic trees of DNA sequences
 fastDNAml is a program derived from Joseph Felsenstein's version 3.3 DNAML
 (part of his PHYLIP package).  Users should consult the documentation for
 DNAML before using this program.
 .
 fastDNAml is an attempt to solve the same problem as DNAML, but to do so
 faster and using less memory, so that larger trees and/or more bootstrap
 replicates become tractable.  Much of fastDNAml is merely a recoding of the
 PHYLIP 3.3 DNAML program from PASCAL to C.
 .
 Note that the homepage of this program is not available any more and so
 this program will probably not see any further updates.

Description: handles qmail forwarding according to a cdb database
 It can create forwarding databases from a sendmail-style /etc/aliases or
 from user-oriented virtual-domain tables.
 .
 fastforward supports external mailing lists, stored in a binary format for
 fast access.  It has a tool to convert sendmail-style include files into
 binary lists.
 .
 fastforward is more reliable than sendmail.  sendmail can't deal with long
 aliases, or deeply nested aliases, or deeply nested include files;
 fastforward has no limits other than memory.  sendmail can produce corrupted
 alias files if the system crashes; fastforward is crashproof.
 .
 fastforward's database-building tools are much faster than sendmail's
 newaliases.  Even better, fastforward deliveries don't pause while the
 database is being rebuilt.
 .
 fastforward does not support insecure sendmail-style program deliveries from
 include files; you can use qmail's secure built-in mechanisms instead.
 fastforward does support program deliveries from /etc/aliases.

Description: faster version of pedigree programs of Linkage
 Genetic linkage analysis is a statistical technique used to map
 genes and find the approximate location of disease genes. There
 was a standard software package for genetic linkage called
 LINKAGE. FASTLINK is a significantly modified and improved
 version of the main programs of LINKAGE that runs much faster
 sequentially, can run in parallel, allows the user to recover
 gracefully from a computer crash, and provides abundant new
 documentation. FASTLINK has been used in over 1000 published
 genetic linkage studies.
 .
 This package contains the following programs:
  ilink:    GEMINI optimization procedure to find a locally
            optimal value of the theta vector of recombination
            fractions
  linkmap:  calculates location scores of one locus against a
            fixed map of other loci
  lodscore: compares likelihoods at locally optimal theta
  mlink:    calculates lod scores and risk with two of more loci
  unknown:  identify possible genotypes for unknowns

Description: Some papers about fastlink
 Genetic linkage analysis is a statistical technique used to map
 genes and find the approximate location of disease genes. There
 was a standard software package for genetic linkage called
 LINKAGE. FASTLINK is a significantly modified and improved
 version of the main programs of LINKAGE that runs much faster
 sequentially, can run in parallel, allows the user to recover
 gracefully from a computer crash, and provides abundant new
 documentation. FASTLINK has been used in over 1000 published
 genetic linkage studies.
 .
 You do not really need these papers about fastlink but it is highly
 recommended to study this documentation before starting with the
 tools of the fastlink package.

Description: quality control for high throughput sequence data
 FastQC aims to provide a simple way to do some quality control checks on
 raw sequence data coming from high throughput sequencing pipelines. It
 provides a modular set of analyses which you can use to give a quick
 impression of whether your data has any problems of which you should
 be aware before doing any further analysis.
 .
 The main functions of FastQC are
  * Import of data from BAM, SAM or FastQ files (any variant)
  * Providing a quick overview to tell you in which areas there may
    be problems
  * Summary graphs and tables to quickly assess your data
  * Export of results to an HTML based permanent report
  * Offline operation to allow automated generation of reports without
    running the interactive application

Description: phylogenetic trees from alignments of nucleotide or protein sequences
 FastTree infers approximately-maximum-likelihood phylogenetic trees from
 alignments of nucleotide or protein sequences. It handles alignments
 with up to a million of sequences in a reasonable amount of time and
 memory. For large alignments, FastTree is 100-1,000 times faster than
 PhyML 3.0 or RAxML 7.
 .
 FastTree is more accurate than PhyML 3 with default settings, and much
 more accurate than the distance-matrix methods that are traditionally
 used for large alignments. FastTree uses the Jukes-Cantor or generalized
 time-reversible (GTR) models of nucleotide evolution and the JTT
 (Jones-Taylor-Thornton 1992) model of amino acid evolution. To account
 for the varying rates of evolution across sites, FastTree uses a single
 rate for each site (the "CAT" approximation). To quickly estimate the
 reliability of each split in the tree, FastTree computes local support
 values with the Shimodaira-Hasegawa test (these are the same as PhyML 3's
 "SH-like local supports").
 .
 This package contains a single threaded version (fasttree) and a
 parallel version which uses OpenMP (fasttreMP).

Description: FASTQ/A short nucleotide reads pre-processing tools
 The FASTX-Toolkit is a collection of command line tools for preprocessing
 short nucleotide reads in FASTA and FASTQ formats, usually produced by
 Next-Generation sequencing machines. The main processing of such FASTA/FASTQ
 files is mapping (aligning) the sequences to reference genomes or other
 databases using specialized programs like BWA, Bowtie and many others.
 However, it is sometimes more productive to preprocess the FASTA/FASTQ files
 before mapping the sequences to the genome—manipulating the sequences to
 produce better mapping results. The FASTX-Toolkit tools perform some of these
 preprocessing tasks.

 These are a set of free sounds and graphics for FreeCraft, a clone of
 the realtime fantasy strategy game, WarCraft II, from Blizzard
 Entertainment.
 .
 Note that this version contains almost all the files needed for a fair
 game experience, and has not anything to do with WarCraft II data (in fact
 spoofs it), as it's completely free.
 .
 This is the last stable snapshot from the FcMP website.

Description: Flush out-of-date disk buffers
 fdflush is a band-aid for floppy (or other) drives with bad disk-change
 sensing. fdflush makes the system believe the disk-change switch has been
 triggered forcing the system to discard the buffered data.
 .
 If you have one of these slightly-broken disk drives, you'll have to run
 fdflush every time you change a disk.
 .
 fdflush is useful for computers which might be sleeping when you change
 floppies or other removable media.
 .
 The command "floppycontrol -f" does the same thing, but the
 fdutils package is significantly larger; it only uses the
 floppy-specific flush ioctl.
 .
 The command "blockdev --flushbufs" only uses the generic flush ioctl.

Description: fetching, filtering and delivering emails
 fdm is a program to fetch mail and deliver it in various ways
 depending on a user-supplied ruleset. Mail may be fetched from
 stdin, IMAP or POP3 servers, or from local maildirs, and filtered
 based on whether it matches a regexp, its size or age, or the output
 of a shell command. It can be rewritten by an external process,
 dropped, left on the server or delivered into maildirs, mboxes, to a
 file or pipe, or any combination.
 .
 fdm is designed to be lightweight but powerful, with a compact but
 clear configuration syntax. It is primarily designed for single-user
 uses but may also be configured to deliver mail in a multi-user
 setup. In this case, it uses privilege separation to minimise the
 amount of code running as the root user.

Description: simple battery power monitor for laptops with ACPI
 fdpowermon is a simple perl script that installs an icon in a system
 tray compatible with the freedesktop.org specification.
 .
 Every three seconds, fdpowermon calls acpi to find out what the current
 battery level is. It will set the output of the acpi command as a
 tooltip text, and will update the used icon as appropriate.
 .
 In addition, fdpowermon can optionally call perl subroutines when the
 power reaches a given level. No such subroutines are provided or
 enabled by default, however.

Description: icons for fdpowermon
 fdpowermon is a simple perl script that installs an icon in a system
 tray compatible with the freedesktop.org specification.
 .
 By default, it uses an icon set from the 'oxygen' icon theme. However,
 that icon theme is fairly large (several tens of megabytes), which is a
 waste if the oxygen-icon-theme package is not installed for other
 reasons. Therefore, this package contains just those icons from the
 oxygen-icon-theme package that are needed by fdpowermon, and nothing
 more.

Description: maintain and setup complicated firewall rules
 ferm is a frontend for iptables. It reads the rules from a
 structured configuration file and calls iptables(8) to insert them
 into the running kernel.
 .
 ferm's goal is to make firewall rules easy to write and easy to
 read. It tries to reduce the tedious task of writing down rules, thus
 enabling the firewall administrator to spend more time on developing
 good rules than the proper implementation of the rule.
 .
 To achieve this, ferm uses a simple but powerful configuration
 language, which allows variables, functions, arrays, blocks. It also
 allows you to include other files, allowing you to create libraries
 of commonly used structures and functions.
 .
 ferm, pronounced "firm", stands for "For Easy Rule Making".

Description: American English male speaker for festival, 16khz sample rate
 This is a diphone database for festival that uses 16k samples for high
 quality sound output. This is a large database (6 MB), and festival will
 convert text to speech more slowly using it, so you might want to install
 festvox-kallpc8k instead if you have low disk space or a slow computer.
 .
 The voice contained in this database is an American English male speaker.
 A different American English voice can be found in the festvox-kdlpc16k
 package if you dislike this one.

 fetchmail is a free, full-featured, robust, and well-documented remote mail
 retrieval and forwarding utility intended to be used over on-demand TCP/IP
 links (such as SLIP or PPP connections).  It retrieves mail from remote mail
 servers and forwards it to your local (client) machine's delivery system, so
 it can then be read by normal mail user agents such as mutt, elm, pine,
 (x)emacs/gnus, or mailx.  The fetchmailconf package includes an interactive
 GUI configurator suitable for end-users.
 .
 Kerberos V and GSSAPI are supported.
 .
 Kerberos IV,  RPA, OPIE and other support for some other features are
 available if the package is recompiled.

Description: set of LaTeX macros for creating Feynman diagrams
 FeynMF is a LaTeX package for easy drawing of professional-quality Feynman
 diagrams, illustrations that depict the fundamental interactions of subatomic
 particles.  The diagrams may be created using either the Metafont
 or MetaPost programs.  FeynMF lays out most diagrams satisfactorily from the
 structure of the graph without any need for manual intervention.
 Nevertheless all the power of Metafont or MetaPost is available for more
 obscure cases.
 .
 Note that you will need the texlive-metapost package in order to use the
 MetaPost-based version of FeynMF.

Description: Tool for parsing flat and CSV files and converting them to different formats
 Ffe has many areas of use with fixed length and CSV files. It can extract
 particular fields or records from a flat file, convert data from one format
 to another (CSV to fixed length, ...), display flat file content in human
 readable form, etc. In addition, one input file can contain several types of
 records (lines) and the input file structure and output definitions are
 independent, meaning one output format can be used with several input files.
 This input file structure and output format are 'freely' configurable,
 so the output can be formatted e.g. as: fixed length, separated, tokenized,
 XML, SQL, ...

Description: multiplayer platform game with dwarfs fighting with/for food
 Feeding Frenzy! is a distributed network game for two to eight players.
 One instance needs to act as server for syncing player names and the
 levels.
 .
 During the game dwarfs need to collect food as fast as possible to bring
 it back to their mushrooms to live.  When a dwarfs leaves his home without
 providing it with food for too long, (s)he dies from hunger.
 The collected food can also be thrown at other dwarfs, making them
 unconscious when hit.  When a power-up is picked up, thrown food will have
 special powers!

 It includes the ability to configure your scenery paths FlightGear setup.
 When selecting an aircraft you are able to view a complete 3d model and see
 its development status and author. When selecting an airport or carrier to
 launch from you can chose either by the ICAO ID (International Civilian
 Aviation Organisation Identifier) or the airport id, with the flexibility of
 selecting a runway and parking position also.
 .
 When launching the simulation FGRun includes a comprehensive configuration
 system, allowing you to directly configure settings such as screen resolution
 and multiplayer settings.
 .
 FGRun also includes support for TerraSync, a tool included with FlightGear
 that allows you to download and use scenery while in the simulation, it can
 also preload the scenery for your selected location as the airport selection

Description: easy to use, yet complex firewall
 Fiaif is an Intelligent Firewall.
 .
 The Goal of FIAIF is to provide a highly customizable script for
 setting up an iptables based firewall.
 .
 Unlike many other scripts, FIAIF can be truly customized allowing
 multiple interfaces (or rather zones). There is no limit on the number
 of zones. All configuration is done through configuration files.
 No need to understand the script behind it all.
 .
 The script makes heavy use of state-full firewalling,
 and all RELATED and ESTABLISHED packets are accepted on all chains.
 If you wish to block something out, don't accept it in the first place.
 .
 The script is written in BASH. Though this is not the optimal
 program to use, it means that you do not need to install extra
 interpreters on your firewall.
 This allows you to have a minimalistic installation on your firewall.
 .
 Install this package if your machine is ever on the internet.

 This perl script takes into advantage the pstex and pstex_t export
 formats of fig2dev (xfig) to separate special text and the rest of a xfig
 file. Then, the text is processed separately using LaTeX, and
 everything is put back together at the end, to make a nice wonderful
 figure with the text formatted exactly the same way as the article you
 are typing ! PDF output is also available.
 .
 Though gv is strictly speaking not necessary for conversion, it can
 be called directly by fig2ps depending on the options you choose.
 For nice PDF output, you should install Type 1 fonts, such as lmodern
 or cm-super.

Description: parametric equalizer LADSPA plugin
 Four-band parametric equaliser. Each section has an active/bypass switch,
 frequency, bandwidth and gain controls. There is also a global bypass
 switch and gain control.
 .
 The 2nd order resonant filters are implemented using a Mitra-Regalia
 style lattice filter, which has the nice property of being stable
 even while parameters are being changed.
 .
 All switches and controls are internally smoothed, so they can
 be used 'live' without any clicks or zipper noises. This should
 make this plugin a good candidate for use in systems that allow
 automation of plugin control ports, such as Ardour, or for
 stage use.

Description: Alternative boot mechanism using a single configuration file
 This package provides an alternative mechanism to boot the system, to
 shut it down and to change runlevels.  The /etc/rc?.d/* links will be
 converted into one single configuration file /etc/runlevel.conf
 instead, which is easier to administrate than symlinks, and is also
 more flexible.
 .
 The package will automatically convert your existing symlinks into
 the file method on installation, and convert the file back into
 symlinks on removal. Both mechanisms are compatible through
 /etc/init.d/rc, /etc/init.d/rcS, /usr/sbin/update-rc.d, and
 /usr/sbin/invoke-rc.d scripts.

Description: command-line utility that reports when files have been altered
 This software is a client to FAM (File Alteration Monitor).
 You can use fileschanged in shell scripts to take action when monitored files
 become altered. In it's simplest form, you can give filenames to monitor from
 standard-input, and it will report when those files have changed via
 standard-output. In a more complex usage, fileschanged can monitor
 command-line specified files recursively, while following symbolic links,
 while staying on the current filesystem, and reporting deleted files as well
 as created and changed files that haven't been written to for 2 seconds.

Description: Web-based file sharing system
 FileTea is a simple way to send files among different users.
 .
 FileTea functions as a web server. Users can drag files into their
 web browser and a URL will be generated for each one. Those URLs can
 be sent to other people, who will be able to start downloading the
 files immediately.
 .
 An HTML5 capable browser is required in order to share the files, but
 any HTTP client can download them, including command-line tools such
 as curl or wget.
 .
 Files are sent through the server, but no data is stored there:
 FileTea is only used to route the traffic. This also means that
 there's no limit to the size of shared files.
 .
 The service is anonymous and does not require user registration.
 Since it's completely web-based, it works in networks with proxies,
 firewalls, etc., as long as all users can reach the FileTea server.

Description: add-on sounds for Czech language spoken dialogs for fillets-ng
 Fish Fillets is strictly a puzzle game. The goal in every of the seventy
 levels is always the same: find a safe way out. The fish utter witty remarks
 about their surroundings, the various inhabitants of their underwater realm
 quarrel among themselves or comment on the efforts of your fish. The whole
 game is accompanied by quiet, comforting music.
 .
 This package contains add-on sound-files for Czech language spoken
 dialogs. It is a completely optional add-on and does not replace
 fillets-ng-data, which is still needed for graphics and other sounds.

Description: Firebird Classic Server - an RDBMS based on InterBase 6.0 code
 Firebird is a relational database offering many ANSI SQL-99 features that
 runs on Linux, Windows, and a variety of Unix platforms. Firebird offers
 excellent concurrency, high performance, and powerful language support
 for stored procedures and triggers. It has been used on production systems
 under a variety of names since 1981.
 .
 The "classic" architecture uses a new process to handle each connection
 which results in somewhat slower operation (but is said to be faster
 than "super" on local connections) yet can take advantage of multiple
 CPUs on SMP machines. This is the "traditional" architecture.
 .
 This package contains the 2.1 branch of Firebird.
 .
 Firebird is a commercially independent project of C and C++ programmers,
 technical advisors and supporters developing and enhancing a multi-platform
 relational database management system based on the source code released by
 Inprise Corp (now known as Borland Software Corp) under the InterBase Public
 License v.1.0 on 25 July, 2000.

Description: Firebird Super Server - an RDBMS based on InterBase 6.0 code
 Firebird is a relational database offering many ANSI SQL-99 features that
 runs on Linux, Windows, and a variety of Unix platforms. Firebird offers
 excellent concurrency, high performance, and powerful language support
 for stored procedures and triggers. It has been used on production systems
 under a variety of names since 1981.
 .
 The "super" architecture uses separate threads to handle each connection.
 It has its advantages (eg: is usually faster and more efficient for large
 numbers of clients) but is unable to use more that one CPU on an SMP
 system and under some circumstances a client may crash all server threads.
 .
 This package contains the 2.1 branch of Firebird.

Description: Firebird Classic Server - an RDBMS based on InterBase 6.0 code
 Firebird is a relational database offering many ANSI SQL-99 features that
 runs on Linux, Windows, and a variety of Unix platforms. Firebird offers
 excellent concurrency, high performance, and powerful language support
 for stored procedures and triggers. It has been used on production systems
 under a variety of names since 1981.
 .
 The "classic" architecture uses a new process to handle each connection
 which results in somewhat slower operation (but is said to be faster
 than "super" on local connections) yet can take advantage of multiple
 CPUs on SMP machines. This is the "traditional" architecture.
 .
 This package contains the 2.5 branch of Firebird.

Description: Firebird SuperClassic Server - an RDBMS based on InterBase 6.0 code
 Firebird is a relational database offering many ANSI SQL-99 features that
 runs on Linux, Windows, and a variety of Unix platforms. Firebird offers
 excellent concurrency, high performance, and powerful language support
 for stored procedures and triggers. It has been used on production systems
 under a variety of names since 1981.
 .
 The "superclassic" architecture uses a new thread to handle each connection.
 This allows for good scaling on multi-processor machines without consuming
 too much operating system resources.
 .
 This package contains the 2.5 branch of Firebird.
 .
 Firebird is a commercially independent project of C and C++ programmers,
 technical advisors and supporters developing and enhancing a multi-platform
 relational database management system based on the source code released by
 Inprise Corp (now known as Borland Software Corp) under the InterBase Public
 License v.1.0 on 25 July, 2000.

Description: GTK program for managing and observing your firewall
 Firestarter is a complete firewall tool for Linux machines. It
 features an easy to use firewall wizard to quickly create a
 firewall. Using the program you can then open and close ports
 with a few clicks, or stealth your machine giving access only
 to a select few. The real-time hit monitor shows attackers
 probing your machine.
 .
 Firestarter is no longer developed and is missing some critical
 features such as IPv6 support, so users may be advised to look
 into more modern alternatives such as gufw.

Description: metapackage for the latest version of FIS-GT.M database
 GT.M is a database engine with scalability proven in large real-time
 transaction processing systems that have thousands of concurrent
 users, individual database file sizes to the Terabyte range (with
 virtually unlimited aggregate database sizes).  Yet the light
 footprint of GT.M allows it to also scale down for use in small
 applications and software appliances (virtual machines).
 .
 The GT.M data model is hierarchical associative memory (i.e.,
 multi-dimensional array) that imposes no restrictions on the data
 types of the indexes or content - the application logic can impose
 any schema, dictionary or data organization suited to its problem
 domain.  (Database engines that do not impose schemas, but which
 allow layered application software to impose and use whatever schema
 that is appropriate to the application are popularly referred to as
 "document oriented", "schemaless" or "schema-free" databases.)
 .
 GT.M's compiler for the standard M (also known as MUMPS) scripting
 language implements full support for ACID (Atomic, Consistent,
 Isolated, Durable) transactions, using optimistic concurrency control
 and software transactional memory (STM) that resolves the common
 mismatch between databases and programming languages. Its unique
 ability to create and deploy logical multi-site configurations of
 applications provides unrivaled continuity of business in the face of
 not just unplanned events, but also planned events, including planned
 events that include changes to application logic and schema.
 .
 This metapackage always depends from the default fis-gtm version.

Description: general-purpose nonlinear curve fitting and data analysis
 Fityk is a flexible and portable program for nonlinear fitting of analytical
 functions (especially peak-shaped) to data (usually experimental data). In
 other words, for nonlinear peak separation and analysis.
 .
 It was developed for analyzing diffraction patterns, but can be also used in
 other fields, since concepts and operations specific for crystallography are
 separated from the rest of the program.
 .
 Fityk offers various nonlinear fitting methods, subtracting background,
 calibrating data, easy placement of peaks and changing peak parameters,
 automation of common tasks with scripts, and much more. The main advantage
 of the program is flexibility - parameters of peaks can be arbitrarily
 bound to each other, eg. the width of a peak can be an independent
 variable, can be the same as the width of another peak or can be given
 by a complicated - common to all peaks - formula.
 .
 libjs-sphinxdoc is necessary for the Javascript stuff in the documentation.

Description: Fix non-ANSI header files
 FixIncludes was created to fix non-ANSI system header files. Many

 The GNU compilers cannot compile non-ANSI headers. Consequently, the
 FixIncludes shell script was written to fix the header files.
 .
 Not all packages with header files are installed on the system, when the
 package is built, so we make fixincludes available at build time of other
 packages, such that checking tools like lintian can make use of it.

Description: copy-on-write utility
 Fl-cow allows you to utilise hard links to save disk space by causing
 hard-linked files to be copied rather than overwritten as they are changed.
 .
 This is useful for making changes to large source trees while keeping a copy
 of the original tree to generate patches from. Also, if you are using the
 Arch revision control system with working copies hard-linked to a revision
 library, using fl-cow can prevent revision library corruption.
 .
 Fl-cow is an LD_PRELOAD hack, not a kernel patch.

Description: Tagger for whole-album FLAC files using data from MusicBrainz
 Tagger for whole-album FLAC files with embedded CUE sheets.
 Data for the tags is retrieved from the MusicBrainz service. Tags are
 written as VORBIS comments or standalone CUESHEET files, and the
 application has the ability to rename a file based on the tags using
 a user-specified template.
 .
 flactag can be run either interactively (to allow the user to select which of
 the results to tag the file with), or in batch mode (allowing files to be
 checked regularly for changes,  and optionally to apply these changes
 automatically).

Description: render and animate FLAM3s and manipulate their genomes
 According to the upstream website:
 .
 Fractal Flames are algorithmically generated images and animations. The
 software was originally written in 1992 and released as open source, aka
 free software. Since then it has developed a lot. It has been incorporated
 into many graphics programs and ported to most operating systems. The shape
 of each image is specified by a long string of numbers - a genetic code of
 sorts.
 .
 You can create your own flames with the Apophysis interactive designer (for
 windows), Qosmic (for Linux), or Oxidizer (for Mac OS X), or Apophysis-J
 (cross-platform in Java). Or you can use the Electric Sheep distributed
 screen saver to join the collective evolution of animated fractal flames.

Description: Multicast file distribution utility
 Flamethrower is intended to be an easy to use multicast file distribution
 system.  It was created to add multicast install capabilities to
 SystemImager, but was designed to be fully functional as a stand-alone
 package.
 .
 Notable characteristics:
  1)  Works with entire directory hierarchies of files, not just single files.
  2)  Uses a server configuration file that takes module entries that are
      similar to those used by rsyncd.conf.
  3)  Flamethrower is an on-demand system.  The multicast of a module is
      initiated when a client connects, but waits MIN_WAIT (conf file) for
      other clients to connect.  If other clients try to connect after a
      cast has been initiated, they simply wait until that cast has finished,
      and catch the next one when it begins.
  4)  The udpcast package is used as the multicast transport, and offers a
      gob and a half of tuning parameters.

 Flashcache is a write-back block device cache for Linux. Using the Linux
 device mapper (DM) it provides an overlay mapper, to cache chunks of

 read access.
 .
 Flashcache supports FIFO and LRU cache sets, is configurable and error
 resistant. It comes with a DKMS kernel module and a corresponding user
 land for command and control. Alternatively it can be configured as
 write-through and write-around flash cache, which does not store any
 persitent data in the flash volume, hence purging the cache upon reboot.
 .
 This package provides the DKMS kernel module.

Description: Pluggable transport to circumvent IP address blocking - browser proxy
 Flashproxy is a tool to circumvent censorship by setting up many, generally
 ephemeral, browser-based proxies, with the goal of outpacing a censor's
 ability to enumerate and block the IP addresses of those proxies. Censored
 clients can then connect to a Tor relay via these proxies, by using a
 hard-to-block, low-bandwidth registration system called the facilitator.
 .
 This package contains the browser proxy to be served from a web server.
 Visitors to this website can then act as ephemeral proxies for censored users.
 .
 Most end-users do not need to install this package.

Description: automates use of a flash disk as the root filesystem
 Flashybrid is a system to help in setting up and managing hybrid
 flash/disk/ram based Debian systems which can run most of the time
 using only a small flash disk for their root filesystem and do a useful,
 but limited task (such as being a router, or a PDA, or a rescue system
 on a USB keydrive). The flash can be as small as 32 mb, though 64 to 256
 mb is more comfortable.
 .
 To use this package, you will need a 2.4 or greater version of the Linux
 kernel, with tmpfs support built in.

Description: assembler and disassembler for Flash (SWF) bytecode
 Flasm disassembles your entire SWF including all the timelines and
 events. Looking at disassembly, you learn how the Flash compiler works.
 You can also do some optimization on the disassembled code by hand or
 adjust the code as you wish. Flasm can then re-assemble the bytecode
 into a new SWF.
 .
 It is also possible to embed Flasm actions in your ActionScript, making
 optimization of large projects more comfortable.
 .
 Flasm is not a decompiler. What you get is the human readable
 representation of SWF bytecode, not ActionScript source.
 .
 Flasm can also compress and decompress SWF files.
 .
 Flasm does not and may never work with Flash 9 files since Flash 9 is
 a new virtual machine and support for it would mean a full rewrite.

Description: constraint problem modelling language
 FlatZinc is a low-level modelling language for constraint
 problems. It is designed to be easily interfaceable to constraint
 solvers (like Gecode). For more information on FlatZinc, please refer
 to the MiniZinc pages of the G12 project
 <http://www.g12.cs.mu.oz.au/minizinc/>.
 .
 We provide a parser that reads a FlatZinc model from a file, and
 returns a Gecode Space object that represents the model. We also
 provide a simple front-end, an executable program that reads a
 FlatZinc model and prints the solution (if any) on the standard
 output.
 .
 The FlatZinc interpreter that ships with Gecode version 4.2.0
 supports the FlatZinc language and MiniZinc global constraint
 definitions of MiniZinc version 1.6.0.

Description: examines source code and looks for security weaknesses
 Flawfinder searches through C/C++ source code looking for potential
 security flaws and produces a report describing the potential flaws
 found in source code, ranking them by likely severity.
 .
 Like RATS, Flawfinder reports are not a direct indication of a
 vulnerability, but provide a reasonable starting point for performing manual
 security audits in source code.
 .
 Flawfinder can also generate differential reports by pointing it to
 a patch (diff) file describing the code changes. This way it can be used
 to determine if the potential flaws found in code have increased or
 decreased after a commit to a source code management system like
 CVS or Subversion.

 Flex is a tool for generating scanners: programs which recognized lexical
 patterns in text. It reads the given input files for a description of a
 scanner to generate. The description is in the form of pairs of regular
 expressions and C code, called rules. Flex generates as output a C source
 file, lex.yy.c, which defines a routine yylex().  This file is compiled
 and linked with the -lfl library to produce an executable. When the
 executable is run, it analyzes its input for occurrences of the regular
 expressions. Whenever it finds one, it executes the corresponding C code.

Description: Flex-style scanner generator for C++
 Flexc++ was designed after `flex'. Flexc++ offers as compared to flex's C++
 option a cleaner class-design.
 .
 Flexc++ generates a scanner class that is ready for use, as well as a member
 function producing the lexical scanner tokens (lex()). The class can easily
 be provided with additional members without the need for polymorphic
 functions. Consequently, classes generated by flexc++ have no virtual members
 and actually have but one public member: lex(), replacing the old-style flex
 and flex++ yylex() function.
 .
 Flexc++ offers many options, among which an option to define classes
 generated by flexc++ in a separate namespace. This allows developers to
 define additional symbols, even outside of the class generated by flexc++,
 without encountering name-collision problems. With flexc++, artificial means
 to prevent name-collisions, like the yy-conventions used by flex and flex++
 are no longer required.  Flexc++ generates C++ code. If C code is required,
 flex should be used. Flexc++'s grammar requirements are highly compatible
 with flex's requirements, so converting a flex grammar into a flexc++ grammar
 should be fairly simple.
 .
 In addition to the flexc++ scanner generator itself and several skeleton
 files, the package contains an extensive man-page, as well as a full manual
 rewritten after the original flex manual, and several examples.

Description: virtual filesystem for flickr online photosharing service
 Flickrfs is a virtual filesystem which mounts on your machine like
 any other partition. Once mounted it retrieves information about your
 photos hosted on your flickr account, and shows them as files.  You
 can easily copy photos from your local machine to this mount and it
 will automatically upload them to your flickr account.  Similarly you
 can copy the files from your mount to the local machine and it will
 download your images from flickr.
 .
 Flickrfs uses FUSE (Filesystem in USErspace) which is a simple
 interface for userspace programs to export a virtual filesystem to
 the Linux kernel.
 .
 All the files in the mount have an associated meta file, which
 provides access to title, description, tags and license information.
 Modifiying any of these fields and saving the meta file will cause
 them to be updated on the server also.
 .
 Flickrfs also includes a syncing mechanism. This allows for automatic
 synchronisation of changes done online directly to your local
 mountpoint.

Description: classic 2D point and click fantasy adventure game
 Flight of the Amazon Queen is a 2D point-and-click adventure game set
 in the 1940s, originally published for DOS and the Amiga.
 .
 You assume the role of Joe King, a pilot for hire who is given the job
 of flying Faye Russell (a famous movie star) into the Amazon jungle for
 a photo shoot. Of course, things never go according to plans. After an
 unfortunate turn of events they find themselves stranded in the heart
 of the Amazon jungle, where Joe will embark on a quest to rescue a
 kidnapped princess and in the process, discover the true sinister
 intentions of a suspiciously located Lederhosen company. In a rich 2D
 environment, Joe will cross paths with a variety of unlikely jungle
 inhabitants including, but not limited to, a tribe of Amazon women and
 6-foot-tall pygmies.
 .

Description: convert text file line endings between Unix and DOS formats
 The program converts line endings of text files between MS-DOS and
 *nix formats. It detects binary files in a nearly foolproof way and
 leaves them alone unless you override this. It will also leave files
 alone that are already in the right format and preserves file
 timestamps. User interrupts are handled gracefully and no garbage or
 corrupted files left behind.
 .
 The program does not convert files to a different character set, and
 it can not handle old Apple Macintosh line endings that use CR only.
 For that (and more), you can use the 'recode' program (package
 'recode').

Description: non-linear video editor
 Flowblade Movie Editor is designed to provide a fast, precise and
 as-simple-as-possible editing experience.
 .
 Flowblade employs film style editing paradigm in which clips are
 usually automatically placed tightly after the previous clip - or
 between two existing clips - when they are inserted on the timeline.
 Edits are fine-tuned by trimming in and out points of clips, or by
 cutting and deleting parts of clips. Film style editing is faster for
 creating programs with mostly straight cuts and audio splits, but may
 be slower when programs contain complex composites unless correct work
 flow is followed.

Description: Fast Light Window Manager
 Flwm is an attempt to combine the best ideas from several

  - Does not look like Windows.
  - Nifty sideways title bars.
  - No icons. You deiconify by picking off a pop-up menu.
    This means no space is wasted by icons.
  - Really small and fast code.
 .
 It is enhanced by the author's own further nutty ideas:
 .
  - Does not use shape extension, more standard resize handles.
  - Occupies as little screen space as possible. The border and titles
    are as thin as you could possibly make them. And maximized
    windows waste only 15 pixels horizontally and zero (count'em)
    pixels vertically!
  - Independent maximize buttons for width & height, close button.
  - Understands Motif, KDE, and GNOME window manager hints.
  - Multiple desktops, controlled from the same menu as the icons.

 Fomp is an LV2 port of the MCP, VCO, FIL, and WAH plugins
 originally written by Fons Adriaensen.
 .
 There are 13 plugins in total: 1 auto-wah, 1 EQ, 3 chorus,
 5 filters, and 3 oscillators.
 .
 The plugin implementations are identical to their LADSPA
 forebears, except the primary frequency port of oscillators
 and filters has been converted to Hz to facilitate use in any
 host without assuming the hidden tuning frequency of
 AlsaModularSynth. All other frequency ports remain as they
 were, using octaves for faithful Moog-like modulation.

Description: convert between Mac and UNIX font formats
 Fondu is a set of programs to convert between Mac font formats and
 PFB, TTF, OTF and BDF files on UNIX.
 .
 Fondu will read a series of mac files, check their resource forks and
 extract all font related items into separate files.
 .
 The input files may be either macbinary files (.bin), binhex files
 (.hqx), bare mac resource forks or data fork resource files (.dfont,
 used by Mac OS/X). A bare resource fork may be generated easily be
 copying a file with a resource fork onto a floppy (or zip) with a DOS
 format. The mac will create an (invisible on the mac) folder called
 resource.frk in which the resource fork will reside as a bare file.

Description: generic font configuration library - support binaries
 Fontconfig is a font configuration and customization library, which
 does not depend on the X Window System. It is designed to locate
 fonts within the system and select them according to requirements
 specified by applications.
 .
 Fontconfig is not a rasterization library, nor does it impose a
 particular rasterization library on the application. The X-specific
 library 'Xft' uses fontconfig along with freetype to specify and
 rasterize fonts.
 .
 This package contains a program to maintain the fontconfig cache
 (fc-cache), a sample program to list installed fonts (fc-list), a program
 to test the matching rules (fc-match) and a program to dump the binary
 cache files in string form (fc-cat). It no longer makes fonts managed by defoma
 available to fontconfig applications.

Description: featureful personal font manager
 fontmatrix is a manager built with the kind of features and abilities
 graphic designers, layout professionals along with others have felt
 necessary, but modernized with some new touches.
 .
 Fontmatrix has a concept of 'tagging'. This makes it really nice to group
 fonts and even sub-group them logically for use in a book for instance.
 It also has extensive gui support for showing all glyphs in a font,
 previews of sample text, variable sizing and also tells what kinds of
 advanced Open Type features are inside each font. These features have
 never been seen outside of a font editor. And not least, it creates a
 nice PDF catalogue of user's fonts for printing or reference. In short,
 fontmatrix is a font manager for professionals, but is nice and user
 friendly.

 not readable in most computer screens.

 It is inspired by Edward Johnston's and Eric Gill's typefaces, with a touch
 of modernism. Cabin incorporates modern proportions, optical adjustments, and
 some elements of the geometric sans.

 The weight distribution is almost monotone, although top and bottom curves are
 slightly thin. Counters of the b, g, p and q are rounded and optically
 adjusted. The curved stem endings have a 10 degree angle. E and F have shorter
 center arms. M is splashed.

 It's a straightforward revival  of a somewhat forgotten, but handsome and

 familiar Century Oldstyle, but with more refined proportions and stroke. This
 version is based on the 18pt from the 1923 catalog.

Description: ancient Greek font revival
 John Baskerville (1706-1775) got involved in typography late in his
 career but his contribution was significant. He was a successful
 entrepreneur and possessed an inquiring mind which he applied to
 produce many aesthetic and technical innovations in printing. He
 invented a new ink formula, a new type of smooth paper and made
 various improvements in the printing press. He was also involved in
 type design which resulted in a latin typeface which was used for the
 edition of Virgil, in 1757.  The quality of the type was admired
 throughout of Europe and America and was revived with great success
 in the early 20th century. Baskerville was also involved in the
 design of a Greek typeface which he used in an edition of the New
 Testament for Oxford University, in 1763. He adopted the practice of
 avoiding the excessive number of ligatures which Alexander Wilson had
 started a few years earlier but his Greek types were rather narrow in
 proportion and did not win the sympathy of the philologists and other
 scholars of his time. They did influence, however, the Greek types of
 Giambattista Bodoni. and through him Didot's Greek in Paris.  The
 typeface has been digitally revived as GFS Baskerville Classic by
 Sophia Kalaitzidou and George D. Matthiopoulos and is now available
 as part of GFS' type library.

Description: smart greek typeface revival
 Giambattista Bodoni was the most prolific Italian typecutter of the
 18th century. He was among the first European typecutters to move
 away from the byzantine cursive tradition with the numerous ligatures
 which was the norm until then. His Greek types influenced many
 subsequent designers, yet they fell in disuse by the middle of the
 19th century.  GFS presented Bodoni's original Greek typeface in the
 commemorative edition of Pindar's Olympian Odes (2004), in digital
 version by George D. Matthiopoulos, and is now available for the
 general public. In the OpenType features, under ligatures, one may
 alternately use diphthongs with the accents placed in between the
 characters, as Giambattista Bodoni did when setting greek texts.

Description: greek font family (Classic Didot revival)
 Under the influence of the neoclassical ideals of the late 18th century, the
 famous French typecutter Firmin Didot in Paris designed a new Greek typeface
 (1805) which was immediately used in the publishing programme of Adamantios
 Korai, the prominent intellectual figure of the Greek diaspora and leading
 scholar of the Greek Enlightenment. The typeface eventually arrived in Greece,
 with the field press which came with Didot’s grandson Ambroise Firmin Didot,
 during the Greek Revolution in 1821.
 .
 Since then the typeface has enjoyed an unrivaled success as the type of choice
 for almost every kind of publication until the last decades of the 20th
 century. Didot's original type design, as it is documented in publications
 during the first decades of the 19th century, was digitized and revived by
 George D. Matthiopoulos in 2006 for a project of the Department of Literature
 in the School of Philosophy at the University of Thessaloniki, and is now
 available for general use.

Description: ancient Greek font (Byzantine cursive hand style)
 During the whole of the 18th century the old tradition of using Greek
 types designed to conform to the Byzantine cursive hand with many
 ligatures and abbreviations - as it was originated by Aldus Manutius
 in Venice and consolidated by Claude Garamont (Grecs du Roy) - was
 still much in practice, although clearly on the wane. GFS Gazis is a
 typical German example of this practice as it appeared at the end of
 that era in the 1790's. Its name pays tribute to Anthimos Gazis
 (1758-1828), one of the most prolific Greek thinkers of the period,
 who was responsible for writing, translating and editing numerous
 books, including the editorship of the important Greek periodical
 Ερμής ο Λόγιος (Litterary Hermes) in Wien.  GFS Gazis has been
 digitally designed by George D. Matthiopoulos.

Description: modern Greek font family with matching Latin
 Neohellenic is a Greek font family characterized by round, even pen
 strokes. It consists of several weights (normal, italic, bold, and
 bold italic) as well as a Latin version.
 .
 Former Greek types had harked back to classical models. In 1927,
 Victor Scholderer chose instead to revive one which had first
 appeared in a 1492 printing of Macrobius attributed to Joannes
 Rubeus. In 1993-4 the typeface was digitized by the Greek Font
 Society, with the addition of a new set of epigraphic symbols.

Description: ancient Greek oblique font revival (companion to GFS Didot)
 In Greece the terms italic and oblique have the same meaning since
 they are borrowed from the latin typographic practice without any
 real historical equivalent in Greek history. Until the end of the
 19th century Greek typefaces were cut and cast independently, not as
 members of a typefamily. The mechanisation of typecutting allowed the
 transformation of upright Greek typefaces to oblique designs.
 Nonetheless, the typesetting practice of a cursive Greek font to
 complement an upright one did not survive the 19th century. The
 experimental font GFS Olga (1995) attempts to revive this lost
 tradition. The typeface was designed and digitised by George
 Matthiopoulos, based on the historical Porson Greek type (1803) with
 the intention to be the companion of the upright GFS Didot font
 whenever there is a need for an italic alternative.

Description: Greek font (Porson revival)
 In England, during the 1790's, Cambridge University Press decided to procure a
 new set of Greek types. The university’s great scholar of Classics, Richard
 Porson was asked to produce a typeface based on his handsome handwriting and
 Richard Austin was commissioned to cut the types. The type was completed in
 1808, after the untimely death of Porson the previous year. Its success was
 immediate and since then the classical editions in Great Britain and the
 U.S.A.  use it, almost invariably. In 1913, Monotype released the typeface
 with some corrections, notably replacing the upright capitals suggested by
 Porson with inclined ones. In Greece the typeface was used under the name
 Pelasgika type. GFS Porson is based on the Monotype version, though using
 upright capitals, as in the original.

Description: ancient Greek oblique font
 From the middle of the 19th century an italic font with many
 calligraphic overtones was introduced into Greek printing. Its source
 is unknown, but it almost certainly was the product of a German or
 Italian foundry. In the first type specimen printed in Greece by the
 typecutter K. Miliadis (1850), the font was listed anonymously along
 others of 11pts and in the Gr. Doumas' undated specimen appeared as
 «11pt Greek inclined». For most of the second half of the century the
 type was used extensively as an italic for emphasis in words,
 sentences or excerpts. In 1889, the folio size Type Specimen of
 Anestis Konstantinidis' publishing, printing and type founding
 establishment also included the type as «Greek inclined [9 & 12 pt]».
 .
 Nevertheless, the excessively calligraphic style of the characters,
 combined with the steep and uncomfortable obliqueness of the
 capitals, was out of favour in the 20th century and the type did not
 survive the conformity of the mechanical type cutting and casting.
 The font has been digitally revived, as part of our typographic
 tradition, by George D.  Matthiopoulos and is part of GFS' type
 library under the name GFS Solomos, in commemoration of the great
 Greek poet of the 19th century, Dionisios Solomos.

 an exquisite book with engraved illustrations of the ancient white
 funerary pottery in Attica in collaboration with Varlamos,
 Montesanto, Damianakis.
 .
 Its complex and heavily decorative design does point to aesthetic
 codes which preoccupied his artistic expression and, although
 impractical for contemporary text setting, it remains an original
 display face, or it can be used as initials.  The book design
 workshop of the Fine Arts School of Athens has been recently
 reorganised, under the direction of professor Leoni Vidali, and with
 her collaboration George D. Matthiopoulos has redesigned digitaly
 this historical font which is now available as GFS Theokritos.

 This font will assist people who are learning kanji, and will help teachers
 of Japanese in the preparation of classroom material.
 .
 In the parts of your document where you want the kanji to be annotated with
 stroke order numbers simply set your document's font to KanjiStrokeOrders.
 You will need to set the size of the font to be large to allow the stroke
 order numbers to show up: 100pt seems to be the minimum usable size.

Description: script font that feels like writing quickly with an inked brush
 When making digital typefaces, the more you refine the shapes of the letters,
 the more energy you take away from them. Because of that, Kaushan Script
 is unrefined - and carries a lot of energy.
 .
 By avoiding typographical sophistication, it stays more natural. The angles
 of the vertical strokes varies and the baseline jumps around, giving it a more
 rustic and natural feeling.
 .
 And while most script fonts look too small when used at regular sizes on the
 web, Kaushan Script is optimized to keep it readable when used as small as
 16 pixels.

Description: classic ATF Typo Script revival font
 Math typesetting requires an ornate capital script font for symbols such as
 script-H (Hilbert space), script-P (powerset), and so on. The most commonly
 used such font in TeX is rsfs (Ralph Smith's Formal Script), which is based on
 the classic ATF Typo Script. Many of the ATF script fonts have been
 professionally digitized, but not this one.
 .
 The lines of the Typo Script digitization are much more delicate and refined,
 largely because they're based on the 18pt metal, while rsfs is designed for a
 10pt normal and 7pt subscript size. Thus, this draft can't really be used as a
 drop-in replacement, as the hairlines will simply be too light to reproduce
 well. At some point, the digital adaptation of the ATF optical scaling
 technology will be working, allowing to produce more robust versions
 suitable for use in text-sized mathematical setting.

Description: Linux Libertine family of fonts
 The Linux Libertine fonts is a set of typefaces containing both a Serif
 version ("Linux Libertine") and a Sans Serif ("Linux Biolinum") designed
 to be used together as an alternative for Times/Times New Roman (and, in
 part, Helvetica/Arial).
 .
 The Serif typeface comes in two shapes and two weights (that is, the
 usual Regular, Italic, Bold, and Bold Italic), and an Small Capitals
 version of the regular typeface. Linux Biolinum, the Sans Serif
 typeface, is available in both Regular and Bold weights.
 .
 This package contains OpenType versions (i.e., with cubic Bézier splines)
 of the fonts, with large support of OpenType features.

Description: OpenType fonts based on Computer Modern
 The Latin Modern fonts, also known as "lm fonts", are a set of
 scalable fonts in PostScript Type 1 and OpenType formats. They are
 based on the PostScript Type 1 version of the Computer Modern fonts
 and contain many additional characters (mostly accented ones).
 .
 This package provides the OpenType variant of these fonts. For support
 for TeX and Type 1 (PostScript) fonts, see the lmodern package.
 .
 The Latin Modern fonts were generated using MetaType1, a program
 based on MetaPost for generating PostScript Type 1 fonts
 (ftp://bop.eps.gda.pl/pub/metatype1/). Their size is reasonable and
 they are usually considered to be of good quality (compared to
 cm-super, for instance; however, cm-super contains font families
 that have no equivalent in this package; additionally, there are
 character sets that are supported by cm-super and not by the Latin
 Modern fonts).

Description: bold condensed script with many ligatures and alternates
 The beauty of real hand-drawn lettering is that the lettering artists subtly
 modify the shape of letters so they connect with the next ones. These linked
 letters-pairs are called "ligatures". Thus, in order to provide a smooth
 hand-written look, the Lobster font provides a large number of ligatures,
 as well as terminal forms (i.e. glyphs that are used for word endings).

 ranges added in the 4.1 release of the Unicode Standard. These ranges
 cover Tifinagh, Kharosthi, hPhags-pa, Old Persian Cuneiform, etc.
 .
 The support for some scripts is not complete because the font lacks
 contextual substitution (via OpenType tables) and composite glyphs, which
 are required to support Kharosthi and other scripts fully. Please read
 the Debian README for a fuller discussion of the problems this may cause.

Description: classic, elegant, sober and strong Roman typeface
 Its wide and open letterforms, and great x-height, make it very legible for
 body text at small sizes, while its tiny details that only show up at bigger
 sizes make it also great for display use.

Description: smart Unicode font for Ethiopian and Erythrean scripts (Amharic et al.)
 The Ethiopic script is used for writing many of the languages of Ethiopia
 and Eritrea. Ethiopic (U+1200..U+137F) was added to Unicode 3.0. Ethiopic
 Supplement (U+1380..U+139F) and Ethiopic Extended (U+2D80..U+2DDF) were
 added to Unicode 4.1. Abyssinica SIL supports all Ethiopic characters which
 are in Unicode including the Unicode 4.1 extensions. Some languages of
 Ethiopia are not yet able to be fully represented in Unicode and, where
 necessary, non-Unicode characters were included in the Private Use Area.
 .
 Please read the documentation to see what ranges are supported
 and for more about the various features of the font.
 .
 Abyssinica SIL is a TrueType font with "smart font" capabilities added using
 the Graphite, OpenType(r), and AAT font technologies. This means that
 complex typographic issues such as the placement of multiple diacritics or
 the formation of ligatures are handled by the font, provided you are
 running an application that provides an adequate level of support for one
 of these smart font technologies.
 .
 This release is a regular typeface, with no bold or italic version
 available or planned.
 .
 More font sources are available in the source package and on the
 project website. Webfont versions and examples are also available.

Description: extended smart Unicode Latin/Greek font family for literacy
 Andika ("Write!" in Swahili) is a sans serif, Unicode-compliant font
 designed especially for literacy use, taking into account the needs of
 beginning readers. The focus is on clear, easy-to-perceive letterforms that
 will not be easily confused with one another.
 .
 A sans serif font is preferred by some literacy personnel for teaching
 people to read. Its forms are simpler and less cluttered than some serif
 fonts can be. For years, literacy workers have had to make do with fonts
 that were available but not really suitable for beginning readers and
 writers. In some cases, literacy specialists have had to tediously cobble
 together letters from a variety of fonts in order to get the all of
 characters they need for their particular language project, resulting in
 confusing and unattractive publications. Andika addresses those issues.
 .
 After receiving many insightful comments on the Design Review and Basic fonts,
 Andika's final letterforms have been refined with alternate shapes still
 available for some characters. This font now contains the same character set
 as Charis SIL and Doulos SIL.
 .
 It provides OpenType and Graphite features like smart code for diacritic
 placement. It supports recent additions to Unicode and the SIL PUA, and
 character assignments are updated to conform to Unicode 5.1

Description: smart Unicode font family for Roman or Cyrillic-based writing systems
 The goal for Charis SIL is to provide a single Unicode-based font family
 that would contain a comprehensive inventory of glyphs needed for almost
 any Roman- or Cyrillic-based writing system, whether used for phonetic or
 orthographic needs. In addition, there is provision for other characters
 and symbols useful to linguists.
 .
 The Charis SIL font contains near-complete coverage of all the characters
 defined in Unicode 5.1 for Latin and Cyrillic. In total, over 2,200 glyphs
 are included, providing support for over 1,500 graphic or control
 characters as well as a large number of ligated character sequences (e.g.,
 contour tone letters used in phonetic transcription of tonal languages).
 .
 Four fonts from this typeface family are included in this release:
    * Charis SIL Regular
    * Charis SIL Bold
    * Charis SIL Italic
    * Charis SIL Bold Italic
 .
 Charis SIL is a TrueType font with "smart font" capabilities added using
 the Graphite, OpenType(r), and AAT font technologies. This means that
 complex typographic issues such as the placement of multiple diacritics or
 the formation of ligatures are handled by the font, provided you are
 running an application that provides an adequate level of support for one
 of these smart font technologies.
 .
 Charis SIL is a trademark of SIL International.

Description: smart Unicode font for Dai Banna (Xishuangbanna Dai)
 This package provides the Dai Banna SIL fonts which are a Unicode
 rendering of the New Tai Lue (Xishuangbanna Dai) script.  Version 2.000 is the
 first Unicode release.  (Version 1.0 was released under the name of 'SIL Dai
 Banna' in legacy encoding.)  Two font families, differing only in weight,
 allow for a wide range of uses.
 .
 The New Tai Lue script is used by approximately 300,000 people who speak the
 Xishuangbanna Dai language in Yunnan, China.  It is a simplification of the
 Tai Tham (Old Tai Lue) script as used for this language for hundreds of years.
 .
 The Dai Banna SIL fonts are smart fonts using a Graphite description. The
 source package includes the source GDL code for the description. The features
 of the fonts are:
 .
  - complete coverage of the New Tai Lue script
  - Graphite smarts for re-ordrant vowels and line-breaking
 .

Description: smart Unicode font for Latin and Cyrillic scripts
 The goal for the Doulos SIL font is to provide a single Unicode-based font
 family that would contain a comprehensive inventory of glyphs needed for
 almost any Roman- or Cyrillic-based writing system, whether used for
 phonetic or orthographic needs. In addition, there is provision for other
 characters and symbols useful to linguists.
 .
 The Doulos SIL font contains near-complete coverage of all the characters
 defined in Unicode 5.1 for Latin and Cyrillic. In total, over 2,200 glyphs
 are included, providing support for over 1,500 graphic or control
 characters as well as a large number of ligated character sequences (e.g.,
 contour tone letters used in phonetic transcription of tonal languages).
 .
 Doulos SIL is a TrueType font with "smart font" capabilities added
 using the Graphite, OpenType(r), and AAT font technologies. This means that
 complex typographic issues such as the placement of multiple diacritics or the
 formation of ligatures are handled by the font, provided you are running an
 application that provides an adequate level of support for one of these
 smart font technologies.
 .
 Doulos SIL is a trademark of SIL International.
 .

Description: smart Unicode font for Hebrew
 Ezra SIL is the same typeface as SIL Ezra and is fashioned after the
 square letter forms of the typography of the Biblia Hebraica Stuttgartensia
 (BHS), a beautiful Old Testament volume familiar to biblical Hebrew scholars.
 The Ezra SIL font is an OpenType 'smart' font.
 .
 Two fonts from this typeface family are included in this release:
 .
     - Ezra SIL version 2.51 (Containing the basic set of Unicode
        characters needed for Biblical Hebrew texts following the
        typeface and traditions of the Biblia Hebraica Stuttgartensia.)
     - Ezra SIL SR version 2.51 (Containing the same set of Unicode
        characters as above but with a different style of cantillation.)
 .

Description: extended Unicode Latin font ("a typeface for the nations")
 Gentium ("belonging to the nations" in Latin) is a Unicode typeface family
 designed to enable the many diverse ethnic groups around the world who use
 the Latin script to produce readable, high-quality publications. The design
 is intended to be highly readable, reasonably compact, and visually
 attractive. Gentium has won a "Certificate of Excellence in Typeface Design"
 in two major international typeface design competitions: bukva:raz! (2001)
 and TDC2003 (2003).
 .
 Gentium provides glyphs for a wide range of Latin and Greek characters. The
 additional 'extended' Latin letters are designed to naturally harmonize with
 the traditional 26 ones. Diacritics are treated with careful thought and
 attention to their use. Gentium also supports both ancient and modern Greek,
 including a number of alternate forms. It currently supports the following
 ranges of Unicode 3.0 (completely unless noted):
 .
  Range          Description
 .
  U+0020-U+007F  Basic Latin
  U+00A0-U+00FF  Latin-1 Supplement
  U+0100-U+017F  Latin Extended-A
  U+0180-U+021F  Latin Extended-B
  U+0222-U+0233  Latin Extended-B (continued)
  U+0250-U+02AD  IPA Extensions
  U+02B0-U+02FF  Spacing Modifier Letters
  U+0300-U+036F  Combining Diacritical Marks
  U+0370-U+03D5  Greek (not including archaic or Coptic)
  U+1E00-U+1EFF  Latin Extended Additional
  U+1F00-U+1FFF  Greek Extended
  U+2000-U+203A  General Punctuation (partial)
  U+2070-U+209F  Superscripts and Subscripts
  U+20A0-U+20CF  Currency Symbols (partial)
  U+2100-U+214F  Letterlike Symbols (only a couple)
 .
 Gentium Regular also includes some Cyrillic glyphs, but they are only early
 drafts. A future version will include a completely revised set, including
 italic, and will expand the support for Latin, Greek and Cyrillic to Unicode
 4.1.
 .
 GentiumAlt is an alternate font with flatter diacritics, specifically
 designed for languages using multiple accents.
 .
 The extended sources (Fontlab .vfb) for this font family are available
 in the source package and on the project website.

Description: smart Unicode font families (Basic and Book Basic) based on Gentium
 Gentium Basic and Gentium Book Basic are font families based on the original
 Gentium design, but with additional weights. The "Book" family is slightly
 heavier. Both families come with a complete regular, bold, italic and bold
 italic set of fonts.
 .
 The supported character set, however, is much smaller than for the main
 Gentium fonts. These "Basic" fonts support only the Basic Latin and Latin-1
 Supplement Unicode ranges, plus a selection of the more commonly used extended
 Latin characters, with miscellaneous diacritical marks, symbols and
 punctuation. A much more complete character set will be supported in a future
 version of the complete Gentium fonts. These "Basic" fonts are intended as a
 way to provide additional weights for basic font users without waiting until
 the complete Gentium character set is finished.
 .
 There are, however, some wonderful new features that are still missing from
 the main Gentium family:
  * Bold
  * Bold Italic
  * The slightly-heavier Book family
  * OpenType and Graphite smart code for diacritic placement
  * A few useful OpenType and Graphite features
  * Support for a few more recent additions to Unicode
  * Character assignments updated to Unicode 5.1
 .
 The font sources are available in the source package and directly on the
 upstream project website.

Description: Unicode font for Yi (a script used in southwestern China)
 The Nuosu SIL font was originally named SIL Yi and developed in 2000
 as a single Unicode font for the standardized Yi script used by a
 large ethnic group in southwestern China.
 .
 The traditional Yi scripts have been in use for centuries, and have a
 tremendous number of local variants. The script was standardized in the
 1970's by the Chinese government. In the process of standardization, 820
 symbols from the traditional scripts of the Liangshan region were chosen
 to form a syllabary.
 .
 The syllable inventory of a speech variety from Xide County, Sichuan
 was used as the phonological basis for standardization. For the most part
 there is one symbol per phonologically-distinct syllable and vice-versa.
 The direction of writing and reading was standardized as left-to-right.
 Punctuation symbols were borrowed from Chinese, and a diacritic was
 incorporated into the system to mark one of the tones.

Description: smart Unicode font for Arabic
 Scheherazade, named after the heroine of the classic Arabian Nights
 tale, is designed in a similar style to traditional typefaces such as
 Monotype Naskh, extended to cover the full Unicode Arabic repertoire.
 .
 The goal for this product was to provide a single Unicode-based font
 family that would contain a comprehensive inventory of glyphs needed
 for almost any Arabic-based writing system. This font makes use of
 state-of-the-art font technologies to support complex typographic
 issues.
 .
 This font provides a simplified rendering of Arabic script, using
 basic connecting glyphs but not including a wide variety of additional
 ligatures or contextual alternates (only the required lam-alef
 ligatures). This simplified style is often preferred for clarity,
 especially in non-Arabic languages, but may be considered unattractive
 in more traditional and literate communities.
 .
 One font from this typeface family is included in this release:
     - Scheherazade Regular
 .
 This release supports virtually all of the Unicode 5.0 Arabic
 character repertoire (excluding the Arabic Presentation Forms blocks,
 which are not recommended for normal use). Font smarts are implemented
 using OpenType technology.

Description: font for Zaghawa Beria (script used in western Sudan and eastern Chad)
 This alphabet is built around a sampling of the markings on livestock
 (especially camels) within the Zaghawa Beria language region of
 western Sudan and eastern Chad. It is an idea that has its origins in
 the work of a Sudanese schoolteacher, who developed the first version
 of this over 25 years ago. The script has since been better adapted
 to the Zaghawa Beria language by Siddik Adam Issa, and he has found a
 great enthusiasm by the people for what he has put together.
 .
 Note that this font is not encoded according to The Unicode Standard,
 as the Zaghawa Beria script has not yet been accepted into the
 standard.

Description: OpenType fonts based on URW Fonts
 The TeX Gyre project, following the Latin Modern project, aims at providing
 a rich collection of diacritical characters in the attempt to cover as many
 Latin-based scripts as possible.
 .
 This package provides the OpenType variant of these fonts. For support
 for TeX and Type 1 (PostScript) fonts, see the tex-gyre package.
 .
 The TeX-GYRE bundle consists of seven font families:
 .
 The TeX Gyre Adventor family of fonts is based on the URW Gothic L
 family (designed by Herb Lubalin and Tom Carnase).
 .
 The TeX Gyre Bonum family of fonts is based on the URW Bookman L family
 (designed by Alexander Phemister).
 .
 The TeX Gyre Chorus font is based on URW Chancery L Medium Italic
 (designed by Hermann Zapf (ITC Zapf Chancery(R), 1979)).
 .
 The TeX Gyre Cursor family is based on the URW Nimbus Mono L family
 (designed by Howard G. (Bud) Kettler in 1955 for the IBM corporation).
 .
 The TeX Gyre Heros family of fonts is based on the URW Nimbus Sans L
 (prepared by Max Miedinger, with Eduard Hoffmann).
 .
 The TeX Gyre Pagella family of fonts is based on the URW Palladio L
 family (designed by Hermann Zapf).
 .
 The TeX Gyre Schola family of fonts is based on the URW Century
 Schoolbook L family (designed by Morris Fuller Benton).
 .
 The TeX Gyre Termes is based on the URW Nimbus Roman No9 L family
 (designed by Stanley Morison together with Starling Burgess and
 Victor Lardent).
 .
 The constituent 4 standard faces of each family have been greatly
 extended, and contain nearly 1200 glyphs each.  Each family is
 available in Adobe Type 1 and Open Type formats, and LaTeX support
 (for use with a variety of encodings) is provided.  Vietnamese
 characters were added by Han The Thanh.

Description: Sans-serif style CJK font derived from Droid
 WenQuanYi Micro Hei font family is a sans-serif style (also known as Hei,
 Gothic or Dotum among the Chinese/Japanese/Korean users) high quality
 CJK outline font. It was derived from "Droid Sans Fallback", "Droid
 Sans" and "Droid Sans Mono" released by Google Corp. This font package
 contains two faces, "Micro Hei" and "Micro Hei Mono", in form of a
 TrueType Collection (ttc) file. All the unified CJK Han glyphs, i.e.
 GBK Hanzi, in the range of U+4E00-U+9FC3 defined in Unicode Standard 5.1
 are covered, with additional support to many other international
 languages such as Latin, Extended Latin, Hanguls and Kanas. The font
 file is extremely compact (~5M) compared with most known CJK fonts.
 As a result, it can be used for hand-held devices or embedded systems, or
 used on PC with a significantly small memory footprint. Because both
 font faces carry hinting and kerning instructions for Latin glyphs,
 they are excellent choices for desktop fonts.

Description: "WenQuanYi Zen Hei" A Hei-Ti Style (sans-serif) Chinese font
 WenQuanYi Zen Hei is a Hei-Ti style (sans-serif type) Chinese font.
 It was designed for general purpose text formatting and on-screen
 display of Chinese characters among many other languages. The embolden
 strokes of the font glyphs produces enhanced screen contrast, making
 it easier to read and recognize. The embedded bitmap glyphs further
 enhance on-screen performance, and can be enabled with the provided
 configuration files.
 .
 WenQuanYi Zen Hei provides a fairly complete coverage of Chinese
 Hanzi glyphs, including both simplified and traditional forms.
 The total glyph number in this font is over 35,000, including over
 21,000 Chinese Hanzi. This font provides full coverage of GBK (CP936)
 charset, CJK Unified Ideographs, as well as the code-points needed
 for zh_CN, zh_SG, zh_TW, zh_HK, zh_MO, ja (Japanese) and ko (Korean)
 locales for fontconfig.
 .
 Starting from version 0.8, this font package provides two font families,
 i.e. the proportional "WenQuanYi Zen Hei", and the monospaced typeface
 named "WenQuanYi Zen Hei Mono".

Description: Font in four weights, reminiscent of 1920s coffee house typography
 Yanone Kaffeesatz was first published in 2004. Its Bold is reminiscent
 of 1920s coffee house typography, while the rather thin fonts bridge
 the gap to present times. You can witness Kaffeesatz use on German
 fresh-water gyms, Dubai mall promos and New Zealand McDonalds ads.
 And of course on coffee and foodstuff packaging and cafe design around
 the globe.
 .
 In 2010 it was decided to be re-released under the SIL Open Font
 License to make it possible to include in software bundles or web font
 services like Googles Font Directory.

Description: YC-20 organ emulation
 The YC-20 is a divide-down combo organ designed in the late 60's. This
 emulation faithfully copies the features, sounds and flaws of the original
 organ.
 .
 Features:
    - 61 keys
    - Two main voice sections
    - Switchable bass section
    - Generator + matrix mixer => no polyphony restrictions
    - A realism control to add flaws found in the real organ
 .
 Flaws:
    - Takes quite a bit of CPU power
    - No touch vibrato
 .
 The emulation is written in Faust and uses Jack for audio and MIDI.

Description: lint tool for chef cookbooks
 Foodcritic has two goals:
 .
 To make it easier to flag problems in your Chef cookbooks that will cause Chef
 to blow up when you attempt to converge. This is about faster feedback. If you
 automate checks for common problems you can save a lot of time.
 .
 To encourage discussion within the Chef community on the more subjective stuff
 - what does a good cookbook look like? Opscode have avoided being overly
 prescriptive. Having a set of rules to base discussion on helps drive out what
 the community think is good style.

Description: Free Pascal - compiler dependency package
 The Free Pascal Compiler is an Object Pascal compiler supporting both Delphi
 and Turbo Pascal 7.0 dialects, as well as Mac Pascal dialects. It provides a
 completely portable RunTime Library (RTL) available on many platforms and
 compatible with Turbo Pascal, along with a platform-independent class-based
 Free Component Library (FCL) adding many Delphi extensions and interfacing
 with many popular open source libraries.
 .
 Extensions have been added to the language, such as function overloading,
 creation and linking of shared libraries, and Delphi language extensions
 including classes, exceptions, ANSI strings, and open arrays.
 .
 This dependency package always depends on the latest available version of
 the package containing the command line compiler.
