Description: sort file trees and pack them into bags
 Fpart is a tool that helps you sort file trees and pack them into bags (called
 "partitions"). It is developed in C and available under the BSD license.
 .
 It splits a list of directories and file trees into a certain number of
 partitions, trying to produce partitions with the same size and number of
 files.
 It can also produce partitions with a given number of files or a limited size.
 Once generated, partitions are either printed as file lists to stdout
 (default) or to files. Those lists can then be used by third party programs.
 .
 Fpart also includes a live mode, which allows it to crawl very large
 filesystems and produce partitions in live. Hooks are available to act on
 those partitions  (e.g. immediatly start a transfer using rsync(1)) without
 having to wait for the filesystem traversal job to be finished. Used this way,
 fpart can be seen as a powerful data migration tool.

 A nameserver basically responds to a query. Interoperability is an
 obvious requirement here. The standard protocol behaviour of different
 DNS implementations is expected to be the same.
 .
 The reality is quite different though. fpdns uses a series of borderline
 DNS queries to determine the vendor, product and version of a nameserver.

Description: sends ICMP ECHO_REQUEST packets to network hosts
 fping is a ping like program which uses the Internet Control Message Protocol
 (ICMP) echo request to determine if a target host is responding.  fping
 differs from ping in that you can specify any number of targets on the command
 line, or specify a file containing the lists of targets to ping.  Instead of
 sending to one target until it times out or replies, fping will send out a
 ping packet and move on to the next target in a round-robin fashion.

Description: Tools to compute LLL-reduction of Euclidian lattices
 fpLLL is a library for computing reduced (nearly orthogonal) bases
 for Euclidean lattices using the floating-point LLL algorithm.
 .
 fpLLL contains multiple different implementations of the
 floating-point LLL reduction algorithm, offering multiple different
 speed/guarantees ratios.
 .
 It contains a 'wrapper' that chooses the estimated best sequence of
 variants in order to provide a guaranteed output as fast as possible.
 In the case of the wrapper, the succession of variants is oblivious
 to the user.
 .
 This package contains the base tools using libfplll.

Description: password manager with GTK+ 2.x GUI
 Figaro's Password Manager 2 (FPM2) is a program that allows you to securely
 store the passwords. Passwords are encrypted with the AES-256 algorithm.
 .
 If the password is for a web site, FPM2 can keep track of the URLs of your
 login screens and can automatically launch your browser. In this capacity,
 FPM2 acts as a kind of bookmark manager. You can teach FPM2 to launch other
 applications, and optionally pass hostnames, usernames or passwords to the
 command line.
 .
 FPM2 also has a password generator that can choose passwords for you.
 It allows you to determine how long the password should be, and what types
 of characters (lower case, upper case, numbers and symbols) should be used.
 You can even have it avoid ambiguous characters such as a capital O or the
 number zero.

 psfrag is a LaTeX package which allows one to replace text elements in
 included EPS graphics by arbitrary LaTeX output. Because psfrag uses
 Postscript for making the replacements, in principle you can't use
 psfrag with pdflatex which doesn't have any interfaces to postscript.
 .
 This package contains the Perl script fragmaster that produces a new
 EPS from your original EPS which already contains all those psfrag
 replacements. This new EPS graphic actually can be converted to PDF
 including all replacements. The resulting "encapsulated" PDF then can
 be used with pdflatex.

Description: feature rich ansi console login engine
 francine is an easy to configure themeable console login program. Its great
 configurability for per tty access-settings and the posibility to put the
 prompt for username and password anywhere within a nicely colored ANSI-screen
 makes it a greatly enhanced replacement for the old clumpy login.
 .
 You need a getty that is able to run different programs than just login. I
 suggest rungetty for that, but (alternative) getty does suffice. It can also
 be used from the telnetd with the -L option.
 .
 This project is a spin-off from the fancylogin project, which is still
 maintained by Richard Bergmair.

 freebsd-glue strives for bug-for-bug compatibility and will even attempt
 to accommodate for unspecified features (such as implicit header inclusion),
 as long as this doesn't cause breakage in other areas.

Description: creating and reading constant databases
 freecdb is a fast, reliable, simple package for creating and reading
 constant databases. Its database structure provides several features:
 .
  * Fast lookups: A successful lookup in a large database normally takes
    just two disk accesses.  An unsuccessful lookup takes only one.
  * Low overhead: A database uses 2048 bytes, plus 24 bytes per record,
    plus the space for keys and data.
  * No random limits: cdb can handle any database up to 4 gigabytes.
    There are no other restrictions; records don't even have to fit into
    memory.  Databases are stored in a machine-independent format.
  * Fast atomic database replacement: cdbmake can rewrite an entire
    database two orders of magnitude faster than other hashing packages.
  * Fast database dumps: cdbdump prints the contents of a database in
    cdbmake-compatible format.
 .
 This package is derived from the cdb package, and uses the original
 cdb library.  See http://cr.yp.to/cdb.html

 Freeciv is a free clone of the turn based strategy game Civilization.
 In this game, each player becomes leader of a civilisation, fighting to

 This version of Freeciv is based on SDL, the Simple DirectMedia Layer library.
 It is recommended to install the »freeciv-client-gtk« package and to use the
 GTK+ client unless you really want to try this one. The SDL client offers a
 different look&feel but lacks some functionality of the GTK+ client.

Description: fast protein contact predictor
 FreeContact is a protein residue contact predictor optimized for speed.
 Its input is a multiple sequence alignment. FreeContact can function as an
 accelerated drop-in for the published contact predictors
 EVfold-mfDCA of DS. Marks (2011) and
 PSICOV of D. Jones (2011).
 .
 FreeContact is accelerated by a combination of vector instructions, multiple
 threads, and faster implementation of key parts.
 Depending on the alignment, 8-fold or higher speedups are possible.
 .
 A sufficiently large alignment is required for meaningful results.
 As a minimum, an alignment with an effective (after-weighting) sequence count
 bigger than the length of the query sequence should be used. Alignments with
 tens of thousands of (effective) sequences are considered good input.
 .
 jackhmmer(1) from the hmmer package, or hhblits(1) from hhsuite
 can be used to generate the alignments, for example.
 .
 This package contains the command line tool freecontact(1).

 games similar to C&C or AoE. It is nearly feature complete compared to
 the original game, and includes a handful of Neat New Features, such as
 queuing peon/fighter production, finding out idle workers, and a completely
 new AI. It also has network connectivity for up to 16 players.
 .
 FreeCraft is not maintained by the upstream anymore, this is the last
 stable version of FreeCraft.
 .
 This version is compiled with some of the possible options, and thus has
 gzip, bunzip2 and SDL support (the last one only for i386 arches). The
 sound options will depend on your personal election on SDL packages.

 You must clear a spaceship from all droids.  To achieve this your
 device will need to take control of more powerful droids, more able
 to confront the most powerful ones.  But you'll also need to manage
 your energy, as you won't be able to control any droid for an
 indefinite time, and even your own device has a limited lifetime.

Description: Software Defined Radio (SDR)
 FreeDV is a digital voice mode intended for transmission and
 reception over high-frequency (HF) radio. It uses a frequency
 division multiplex (FDM) modem with 15 carriers and no forward error
 correction (FEC). A low bit-rate voice coder-decoder (Codec 2)
 provides voice quality without the listener fatigue caused by noise
 and interference normally associated with analog single sideband
 (SSB) voice. A HF SSB transceiver, personal computer and two sound
 cards are required. Path simulation and on-the-air HF testing have
 shown that decoding voice is possible at a signal-to-noise ratio of
 4 dB.
 .
 The FreeDV software was developed by David Rowe (Codec 2, FDM
 modem implementation, integration) and David Witten (GUI,
 architecture design). The FreeDV design and user interface was based
 on the earlier FDMDV program which was developed by Francesco
 Lanza. The FDM modem design and development was supported from Peter
 Martinez.

Description: Provides the binaries of the FreeFem++ FE suite
 FreeFem++ is an implementation of a language dedicated to the finite
 element method. It enables you to solve Partial Differential
 Equations (PDE) easily.
 .
 Problems involving PDE from several branches of physics such as
 fluid-structure interactions require interpolations of data on
 several meshes and their manipulation within one program. FreeFem++
 includes a fast quadtree-based interpolation algorithm and a language
 for the manipulation of these data on multiple meshes. It contains
 also a powerful mesh generation and adaption tool integrated
 seamlessly in FreeFem++ called bamg.
 .
 FreeFem++ is written in C++ and the FreeFem++ language is a C++ idiom
 allowing for a smooth learning curve.

Description: Language and solver for partial differential equations in 3D
 FreeFEM3D (aka ff3d) is a 3D solver of partial differential
 equations (PDE).  It is a member of the familly of the freefem
 programs (see http://www.freefem.org).
 .
 ff3d, as well as its cousins, is a PDE solver driven by a
 user-friendly language. It solves many kind of problems such as
 elasticity, fluids (Stokes and Navier-Stokes) and a lot more. The
 user has to enter the equation associated with the problem, giving
 either the PDE in strong formulation or weak (variational)
 formulation.
 .
 ff3d can use either the Finite Elements method (the mesh of the
 geometry being provided by the user) or a Fictitious Domain like
 approach where the geometry is described using Constructive Solid
 Geometry (CSG). This description is done using the POV-Ray language
 but others such as VRML could be added.
 .
 The processing of the results is left to the user.  One can use
 various graphic tools: output in the MEdit mesh format or VTK are
 supported. The implementation of a VTK base visualization module is
 underway.
 .
 The goal of ff3d is to provide a good teaching tool and a research
 toolbox (the code is written in C++ and its design is such that new
 methods can be easily implemented).

Description: Java Program for creating and viewing Mindmaps
 Taking the Concept-Mapping approach to Human-Computer Interface design.
 A mind mapper, and at the same time an easy-to-operate hierarchical editor
 with strong emphasis on folding. These two are not really two different
 things, just two different descriptions of a single application. Often used
 for knowledge and content management.
 .
 FreeMind doesn't work with classpath based Java implementations. Use OpenJDK
 (or Sun's Java), and check freemind(1) for more information.

Description: turn-based space empire and galactic conquest game
 FreeOrion is a turn-based space empire and galactic conquest (4X) game being
 designed and built by the FreeOrion project. FreeOrion is inspired by the
 tradition of the Master of Orion games, but is not a clone or remake of that
 series or any other game.
 .
 The game is about the construction of a living, breathing universe in a grand
 campaign model. You can develop your own galactic empire and explore new star
 systems with your fleets as one of several unique human or alien species.
 Colonization of new worlds, researching new technology, managing your
 resources and defending your planets against the AI or other human players on
 a galactic scale are your main objectives.

Description: Java program for working with Mind Maps
 Freeplane is a free and open source software application that supports
 thinking, sharing information and getting things done at work, in school
 and at home. The core of the software is tools for mind mapping (also
 known as concept mapping or information mapping) and using mapped
 information.

 Freeplane allows the user to add content as quickly and naturally as they
 would in a text editor, yet producing structured content that can be
 manipulated as easily as a diagram.
 .
 Features include ordering ideas in nodes and freely positionable
 nodes, connecting nodes, automatic/conditional styles, scripting,
 add-ons, LaTeX, search/filtering, different export features, printing,
 password protection of nodes/maps and more.
 .
 See http://freeplane.sourceforge.net/wiki/index.php/Main_Page for a full
 list of applications and features.

Description: a portable interpreter for SCI games like Space Quest 3
 FreeSCI is a portable interpreter for SCI games, such as the Space Quest
 series (starting with SQ3) or Leisure Suit Larry (2 and sequels).
 .
 FreeSCI is still incomplete. You should be able to finish some SCI games with
 it, though.
 This release has the following limitations (plus some bugs):
  - Only SCI0 games are supported (later versions are being worked on separately
    in the experimental "glutton" branch)
  - The SCI debug functions aren't fully supported (and probably never will be,
    since we're using our own debug functions)
 .
 It has the following improvements over Sierra SCI:
  - Support for various filters and extended drawing operations for graphics
  - saving and restoring the game state is possible from more places than the
    Sierra SCI engine allowed (using the debugger functions)
  - Better debugger
  - More portable
  - It's Free software :-)

Description: Facilitates production of HTML tables
 Freetable is a perl script that aims to make the production of HTML
 tables a little easier.  This script works as a filter, reading stdin
 and writing to stdout.
 .
 The input syntax is as roughly follows:
 .
       <wwwtable table-options...>
         initial text (e.g. <caption> ... </caption>).
         (X, Y) options for cell (X, Y)
         text for cell (X,Y)...
         ((X,Y)) options for header cell X,Y
         text for header cell (X,Y)...
       </wwwtable>
 .
 Rows and cells may be specified in any order, numbering starts at 1.
 X and/or Y may be replaced by regular expression, explicit range
 or even arbitrary Perl code to indicate rows or columns.
 Options or text (or both) may be omitted for cells.  Cells
 may be omitted completely if they are empty or fall under the
 rowspan/colspan specifications of another cell.  Cells may contain
 arbitrary HTML text, including other freetable tables.

Description: tagger and parser for Dutch language (runtime)
 Memory-Based Learning (MBL) is a machine-learning method applicable to a wide
 range of tasks in Natural Language Processing (NLP).
 .
 Frog is a modular system integrating a morphosyntactic tagger, lemmatizer,
 morphological analyzer, and dependency parser for the Dutch language.  It is
 based upon it's predecessor TADPOLE (TAgger, Dependency Parser, and
 mOrphoLogical analyzEr).  Using Memory-Based Learning techniques, Tadpole
 tokenizes, tags, lemmatizes, and morphologically segments word tokens in
 incoming Dutch UTF-8 text files, and assigns a dependency graph to each
 sentence.  Tadpole is particularly targeted at the increasing need for fast,
 automatic NLP systems applicable to very large (multi-million to billion word)
 document collections that are becoming available due to the progressive
 digitization of both new and old textual data.
 .
 NB: As of 2012-06 (upstream release 0.12.15), Frog can be considered beta
 software.
 .
 Frog is a product of the ILK Research Group (Tilburg University,
 The Netherlands) and the CLiPS Research Centre (University of Antwerp,
 Belgium).
 .
 If you do scientific research in NLP, Frog will likely be of use to you.

Description: LALR(k) parser generator for Haskell 98
 Frown is inspired by the parser generator Happy and uses a syntax
 quite simular as the syntax used by Happy. Happy only handles LALR(1)
 grammars while Frown can use more extensive LALR(k) grammars and the
 parsers generated by Frown are also faster than the parsers generated
 by Happy.
 .
 The salient features of Frown are:
   - The generated parsers are time and space efficient. On the
     downside, the parsers are quite large.
   - Frown generates four different types of parsers. As a common
     characteristic, the parsers are genuinely functional
     (ie 'table-free'); the states of the underlying LR automaton are
     encoded as mutually recursive functions. Three output formats use
     a typed stack representation, one format due to Ross Paterson
     (code=stackless) works even without a stack.
   - Encoding states as functions means that each state can be treated
     individually as opposed to a table driven-approach, which
     necessitates a uniform treatment of states. For instance,
     look-ahead is only used when necessary to resolve conflicts.
   - Frown comes with debugging and tracing facilities; the standard
     output format due to Doaitse Swierstra (code=standard) may be
     useful for teaching LR parsing.
   - Common grammatical patterns such as repetition of symbols can be
     captured using rule schemata. There are several predefined rule
     schemata.
   - Terminal symbols are arbitrary variable-free Haskell patterns or
     guards. Both terminal and nonterminal symbols may have an
     arbitrary number of synthesized attributes.
   - Frown comes with extensive documentation; several example grammars
     are included.
 .
 Furthermore, Frown supports the use of monadic lexers, monadic
 semantic actions, precedences and associativity, the generation of
 backtracking parsers, multiple start symbols, error reporting and a
 weak form of error correction.

 The salient features of Frown are:
   - The generated parsers are time and space efficient. On the
     downside, the parsers are quite large.
   - Frown generates four different types of parsers. As a common
     characteristic, the parsers are genuinely functional
     (ie 'table-free'); the states of the underlying LR automaton are
     encoded as mutually recursive functions. Three output formats use
     a typed stack representation, one format due to Ross Paterson
     (code=stackless) works even without a stack.
   - Encoding states as functions means that each state can be treated
     individually as opposed to a table driven-approach, which
     necessitates a uniform treatment of states. For instance,
     look-ahead is only used when necessary to resolve conflicts.
   - Frown comes with debugging and tracing facilities; the standard
     output format due to Doaitse Swierstra (code=standard) may be
     useful for teaching LR parsing.
   - Common grammatical patterns such as repetition of symbols can be
     captured using rule schemata. There are several predefined rule
     schemata.
   - Terminal symbols are arbitrary variable-free Haskell patterns or
     guards. Both terminal and nonterminal symbols may have an
     arbitrary number of synthesized attributes.
   - Frown comes with extensive documentation; several example grammars
     are included.
 .
 Furthermore, Frown supports the use of monadic lexers, monadic
 semantic actions, precedences and associativity, the generation of
 backtracking parsers, multiple start symbols, error reporting and a
 weak form of error correction.

Description: cool game where you pop out the bubbles!
 Frozen-Bubble is a clone of the popular "Puzzle Bobble" game, in which
 you attempt to shoot bubbles into groups of the same color to cause
 them to pop.
 .
 Players compete as penguins and must use the arrow keys to aim a
 colored bubble at groups of bubbles. The objective is to clear all the
 bubbles off the screen before a bubble passes below a line at the
 bottom.
 .
 It features 100 single-player levels, a two-player mode, music and
 striking graphics. A level editor is also included to allow players to
 create and play their own levels.

 This is a very strong chess engine, placed second in the 13th world
 computer chess championship 2005. It uses the UCI (universal chess
 interface), for chess engines as communication protocol. This means
 to play against it, you will have to use an UCI capable interface,
 like knights. This distribution comes with an opening book of moves
 that the engine can use for the first few moves of the game. This
 increases performance in the chess games opening.

Description: tools to preserve tmpfs contents across reboots
 fs2ram manages temporary file systems across reboots. Each tmpfs mountpoint
 can be associated with a pre-mount script, which is executed by fs2ram at
 each shutdown/reboot before the file system is unmounted. The pre-unmount
 script must print a post-mount script on standard output, which is saved and
 then run at boot time after fs2ram mounts the corresponding file system.
 .
 This package provides two pre-unmount scripts designed to preserve folder
 structure and file permissions across reboots: this is needed to allow
 hierarchies such as /var/cache or /var/log to be mounted as tmpfs.

Description: file system archiver
 FSArchiver is a system tool that allows you to save the contents of a
 file system to a compressed archive file. The file system can be restored
 on a partition which has a different size and it can be restored on a
 different file system.
 Unlike tar/dar, FSArchiver also creates the file system when it extracts
 the data to partitions.
 Everything is checksummed in the archive in order to protect the data. If
 the archive is corrupt, you just lose the current file, not the whole archive.

 This is a set of scripts that make immutable the root and other filesystems.
 Using aufs they pack a tmpfs filesystem and the filesystem forcing
 changes to be written to the tmpfs.
 .
 The root filesystem is protected by an initramfs script. Other filesystems
 are protected by an init script. All protected filesystems become read-only
 ensuring their immutability even on power-offs.
 .
 This can be used for public computers to prevent damage or changes.

Description: File system synchronization tool (1-way, over SSH)
 fssync is a 1-way file-synchronization tool that tracks inodes and maintains a
 local database of files that are on the remote side, making it able to:
  - handle efficiently a huge number of dirs/files
  - detect renames/moves and hard-links
 .
 It aims at minimizing network traffic and synchronizing every detail of a file
 system:
  - all types of inode: file, dir, block/character/fifo, socket, symlink
  - preserve hard links
  - modification time, ownership/permission/ACL, extended attributes
  - sparse files
 .
 Other features:
  - it can be configured to exclude files from synchronization
  - fssync can be interrupted and resumed at any time, making it tolerant to
    random failures (e.g. network error)
  - algorithm to synchronize file content is designed to handle big files
    like VM images efficiently, by updating fixed-size modified blocks in-place
 .
 Main usage of fssync is to prevent data loss in case of hardware failure,
 where RAID1 is not possible (e.g. in laptops).
 .
 On Btrfs file systems, fssync is an useful alternative to `btrfs send` (and
 `receive`) commands, thanks to filtering capabilities. This can be combined
 with Btrfs snapshotting at destination side for a full backup solution.

Description: FreeType version of Jam, a replacement for make
 This is a version of Jam with additional features and bugfixes, which
 is maintained by the FreeType project.
 .
 Perforce's Jam (formerly called Jam/MR, available in package "jam")
 is a powerful and highly customizable utility to build programs and
 other things, that can run on Un*x, Nt, VMS, OS/2 and Macintosh MPW,
 using portable Jamfiles.  It can build large projects spread across
 many directories in one pass, and can run jobs in parallel where make
 would not.
 .
 It takes some time to fully apprehend, especially when one's already
 accustomed to make(1), but there's no comparison in power when
 comparing these two tools.
 .
 Standard rules:
  - can automatically extract header dependencies for C/C++ (you can
 customize for you own language)
  - provide for automatic "clean", "install", "uninstall" rules,
 so that an automake-like tool is not needed

Description: Semantic checker for Fortran 77 programs
 ftnchek (short for Fortran checker) is a tool designed to detect
 certain errors in a Fortran program that a compiler usually does not,
 thus assisting users in the debugging of their Fortran programs.
 .
 Unlike syntax errors, semantic errors are legal in the Fortran
 language but are wasteful or may cause incorrect operation. For
 example, variables which are never used may indicate some omission in
 the program; uninitialized variables contain garbage which may cause
 incorrect results to be calculated; and variables which are not
 declared may not have the intended type.
 .
 ftnchek can also be used to provide call-trees, cross-reference of
 subprogram calls and COMMON blocks usage, source listings, symbol
 tables and other things you might find useful when debugging a
 Fortran program.

 FTP-Proxy is much less complex than any current FTP server, has been designed
 with great care and performs chroot(), setuid(), setgid() to avoid possible
 vulnerabilities, and is believed to be immune against current known attacks.
 .
 FTP-Proxy features include:
  o Securely relays FTP connections between clients and servers
  o Can switch connections from active to passive and vice versa
  o Utilizes port ranges for both control and data connections
  o Provides extensive auditing (via syslog or rotating log files)
  o Can separate user related from system triggered audit events
  o Provides command restriction based on logged in user name
  o Allows command argument checking with regular expressions
  o Is able to retrieve configuration data from an LDAP directory
  o Has been thoroughly tested against buffer overflow attacks
  o Fully conforms to RFC 959 and 1123 (the basic FTP RFCs)
  o Planned to support RFC 1579 ("Firewall Friendly FTP")
  o Planned to support RFC 2428 (IPv6 Extensions for FTP)
  o Based on GNU AutoConf, supposed to run on many UNIX systems

Description: The FTP client with SSL or TLS encryption support
 ftp is the user interface to the ARPANET standard File Transfer Protocol.
 The program allows a user to transfer files to and from a remote network
 site.
 .
 ftp-ssl replaces normal ftp using SSL or TLS authentication and encryption.
 It interoperates with normal ftpd.
 It checks if the other side is also talking SSL or TLS, if not it falls back
 to normal ftp protocol.
 .
 Advantages over normal ftp(d): Your passwords and the data you send
 will not go in cleartext over the line. Nobody can get it with
 tcpdump or similar tools.

 alternatives, such as vsftpd, proftpd, or pure-ftpd.
 .
 This server supports IPv6, and can be used in standalone mode as well
 as in inetd-slave mode, but other servers have better long-term
 security screening.
 .
 The server can be used with GNU/Linux, GNU/kFreeBSD, and GNU/Hurd.

Description: FTP server with SSL encryption support
 This is the netkit ftp server with encryption support.
 .
 ftpd-ssl replaces normal ftpd using SSL authentication and encryption.
 It interoperates with normal ftp.
 It checks if the other side is also talking SSL, if not it falls back
 to normal ftp protocol.
 .
 Advantages over normal ftp(d): Your passwords and the data you send
 will not go in cleartext over the line. Nobody can get it with
 tcpdump or similar tools.

Description: file mirroring utility
 ftpgrab is a utility for maintaining FTP mirrors. In fact not unlike the
 "Mirror" perl program. However ftpgrab is oriented towards the smaller
 site which doesn't have the resources to mirror entire version trees of
 software.
 .
 The primary "plus point" of ftpgrab is that it can base download decisions
 by parsing version numbers out of filenames. For example, ftpgrab will
 recognize that the file "linux-2.2.2.tar.gz" is newer than
 "linux-2.2.1.tar.gz" based on the version string. It will then download
 the new version and delete the old one when it is done, thus saving you
 mirroring 10 kernel versions all at >10Mb each.

Description: literate-programming tool
 Literate-programming allows the programmer to write a program's
 code and the code's documentation, with equal importance accorded
 to both. This helps to produce well-documented code.
 .
 Unlike other literate-programming tools, funnelweb is not derived
 from Knuth's cweb.
 .
 It claims the following technical features:
  * Can be used with any programming language.
  * Runs on most platforms.
  * Mature and essentially bug-free (released 1992).
  * Simple; specifically designed to minimize errors.
  * High speed; doesn't stretch the development cycle.
  * Generates documentation in HTML and TeX forms.
 .
 This package does not include the reference, tutorial, and developer
 manuals.  See package funnelweb-doc for these.

Description: FUSE file system that provides POSIX functionality
 With posixovl it is possible to mount FAT, VFAT, NTFS
 file system so that it behaves like POSIX. File permissions,
 symbolic links etc. are supported transparently. An extra file
 stores the information and the file system itself stays unmodified.
 It is a modern equivalent of the UMSDOS file system.
 .
 Typical use: Mount an USB FAT32 drive with posixovl and your
 files retain their permission settings.
 .
 This package extends mount and provides option '-t posixovl'.

Description: Fuzzing program to test applications
 Fusil is a fuzzing framework designed to expose bugs in software by
 changing random bits of its input.
 .
 It helps to start process with a prepared environment (limit memory,
 environment variables, redirect stdout, etc.), start network client or
 server, and create mangled files. Fusil has many probes to detect
 program crash: watch process exit code, watch process stdout and syslog
 for text patterns (eg. "segmentation fault"), watch session duration,
 watch cpu usage (process and system load), etc.
 .
 Fusil is based on a modular architecture. It computes a session score
 used to guess fuzzing parameters like number of injected errors to
 input files.

Description: spamassassin plugin to check image attachments
 This Spamassassin plugin checks for specific keywords in image/gif,
 image/jpeg or image/png attachments, using gocr (an optical character
 recognition program).  This plugin can be used to detect spam that
 puts all the real spam content in an attached image, while the mail
 itself is only random text and random html, without any URL's or
 identifiable information.  Additionally to the normal OcrPlugin, it
 can do approximate matches on words, so errors in recognition or
 attempts to obfuscate the text inside the image will not cause the
 detection to fail.
 .
 This is a development version from SVN. Currently, this SVN
 version is the only one that works with spamassassin 3.2.

 them audacious and mpd.
 .
 There is also a very powerful menu system that has an extensive
 default configuration but may be customized and extended by each
 user to fit personal requirements.

Description: icon *.xpm files from fvwm development site
 This package contains small icons for use with window manager menus.
 The icons include generic symbols (balls, books, hexagons) and descriptive
 icons for programs (file manager, netscape logo etc.). Note, that these
 icons are quite basic and do not include any shadow effects.
 .
 Originally the icons were for FVWM which is a small memory footprint
 ICCCM2 compliant multiple virtual desktop window manager.

Description: Old version of the F(?) Virtual Window Manager
 This package contains the old version of the FVWM windows manager.
 It is no longer supported upstream, having been replaced by FVWM 2,
 and so no non-Debian-related bugs will be fixed unless someone
 else provides a patch.
 .
 You probably only want to use this package instead of the fvwm
 package if you know what you are doing or have very specific
 requirements.
 .
 FVWM is a fairly small window manager which provides
 a three-dimensional appearance and a virtual desktop,
 complete with colour icons.
 .
 You will need to install the fvwm-common package if you want the
 xpmroot command and some icons, along with manual pages for the modules.

 FWEB has grown out of Knuth and Levy's CWEB; it is far more
 configurable and customizable than the original, uses LaTeX to
 typeset documented code, provides a very powerful macro processor...
 .
 Ratfor programmers may appreciate the builtin Ratfor-to-Fortran
 translator if they don't have the right compiler.

 Other languages than those cited may be used, but without code

Description: File subsets extractor based on genetic algorithms
 Genetic Algorithm File Fitter (gaffitter) is a command-line software
 written in C++ that extracts --via genetic algorithm-- subsets of an
 input list of files/directories that best fit the given volume size
 (target), such as CD, DVD and others.
 .
 gaffitter provides an intelligent manner (thanks to Genetic Algorithm)
 to minimize the error between the desired target size and the selected
 candidates of files/directories. Gaffitter highlights:
 .
   * Uses a global meta-heuristic (Genetic Algorithm search).
   * The command-line interface provides high integration (via pipe) with
     other tools, i.e. works as a "filter".
   * Allow the user to enter 'size identifier' pairs directly instead
     of file/dir names.
   * Pretty configurable. gaffitter have many input parameters to
     control/adjust its behavior (including GA params).

Description: Amazons boardgame for GNOME
 Amazons is a game played on a 10x10 chess board. Each side has four pieces
 (amazons) that move like chess queens (in a straight line in any direction).
 Instead of capturing pieces like in chess, the game is determined based on who
 moves last.
 .
 Each move consists of two parts. First an amazon moves to a new square and
 then fires an arrow to another square (the arrow is fired in a straight line
 in any direction from the square the amazon landed on). The square the arrow
 lands on becomes a permenant block for the rest of the game. No one can move
 over it, or fire an arrow over it. Every turn an amazon must move and fire an
 arrow, so every turn there is one less square available on the board. Try and
 block in your opponent or section off a good chunk of the board for yourself.

Description: File and directory monitoring system
 Gamin is a file and directory monitoring system which allows
 applications to detect when a file or a directory has been added,
 removed or modified by somebody else.
 .
 It can be used by desktops like KDE, GNOME or Xfce to have their
 virtual file systems keep track of changes to files and directories.
 For example, if a file manager displays a directory to the user, and
 the user removes one of the files via the command-line, gamin will
 notify the file manager of this change so that it can update the
 directory display.
 .
 Gamin has been designed as a drop-in replacement for FAM with security
 and maintainability in mind and can use Linux's advanced inotify
 service when available.

Description: Tool for examining the internals of Qt application
 GammaRay is a tool for examining the internals of a Qt application and
 to some extent also manipulate it. GammaRay uses injection methods to
 hook into an application at runtime and provide access to a wide variety
 of interesting information. It provides easy ways of navigating through
 the complex internal structures you find in some Qt frameworks, such as
 QGraphicsView, model/view, QTextDocument, state machines and more.

Description: Ganglia extra modules for Linux (IO, filesystems, multicpu)
 Ganglia's core modules provide essential metrics like RAM and CPU load
 and most of them are implemented for any platform where Ganglia runs.
 The ganglia-modules-linux project is not constrained by the requirements
 to support all the Ganglia platforms: these modules are implemented
 exclusively for Linux users.  The implementations are high-performance
 C code.  The exact modules currently included are IO statistics
 (similar to the statistics from iostat), individual filesystem capacity
 statistics and per-core CPU metrics.

Description: cluster monitoring toolkit - scalable Nagios integration
 ganglia-nagios-bridge brings Ganglia and Nagios together, taking the
 metrics from Ganglia agents, applying thresholds, deciding when they are
 in a bad state and mapping them to service definitions in Nagios.
 Nagios can then display the network state, highlight hotspots and raise
 notifications in the usual manner.
 .
 Using regular expressions in the ganglia-nagios-bridge config and the
 nagios config files it is possible to enable alerting for thousands of
 hosts very quickly, with less than 50 lines of config in total.

Description: Groovy build framework based on scripting Ant tasks
 Gant is a build tool for scripting Ant tasks using Groovy instead of
 XML to specify the build logic. A Gant build specification is a
 Groovy script and so can bring all the power of Groovy to bear
 directly, something not possible with Ant scripts. Whilst it might be
 seen as a competitor to Ant, Gant uses Ant tasks for many of the
 actions, so Gant is really an alternative way of doing builds using
 Ant, but using a programming language rather than XML to specify the
 build rules.

Description: graphical player for Interactive Fiction games
 Gargoyle is an Interactive Fiction (text adventure) player that
 supports all the major interactive fiction formats.
 .
 Most interactive fiction is distributed as portable game files. These
 portable game files come in many formats. In the past, you used to
 have to download a separate player (interpreter) for each format of
 IF you wanted to play. Instead, Gargoyle provides unified player.
 .
 Gargoyle is based on the standard interpreters for the formats it
 supports: .taf (Adrift games, played with Scare), .dat (AdvSys),
 *.agx/.d$$ (AGiliTy), .a3c (Alan3), .asl/.cas (Quest games, played
 with Geas), .jacl/.j2 (JACL), .l9/.sna (Level 9), .mag (Magnetic),
 *.saga (Scott Adams Grand Adventures), .gam/.t3 (TADS),
 *.z1/.z2/.z3/.z4/.z5/.z6/.z7/.z8 (Inform Z-Machine games, played with
 Frotz, Nitfol or Bocfel), .ulx/.blb/.blorb/.glb/.gblorb (Inform or
 Superglús games compiled to the Glulxe VM in Blorb archives, played
 with Git or Glulxe), .zlb, .zblorb (Inform Z-Machine games in Blorb
 archives, played with Frotz).
 .
 (note: do not confuse the Git Glux interpreter with the Git DVCS or
 the GNU Interactive Tools)
 .
 Gargoyle also features graphics, sounds and Unicode support.
 .
 Technically all the bundled interpreters support the Glk API to
 manage I/O (keyboard, graphics, sounds, file) in IF games. Gargoyle
 provides a Glk implementation called garglk that displays texts and
 images in a graphical Gtk window, with care on typography.
 .
 Limitations:
 .
 * This free version of gargoyle does not include the non-free Hugo
 interpreter (and uses a different, free monospace font).
 .
 * While Gargoyle can display in-game pictures, it does not provide a
 way to display the cover art present in some Blorb archives.
 .
 * The TADS interpreter doesn't support HTML TADS; you can play
 the games, but will miss the hyperlinks.

 This version of garlic recognizes PDB format version 2.1. Garlic may
 also be used to analyze protein sequences.
 .
 It only depends on the X libraries, no other libraries are needed.
 .
 Features include:
  - The slab position and thickness are visible in a small window.
  - Atomic bonds as well as atoms are treated as independent drawable
    objects.
  - The atomic and bond colors depend on position. Five mapping modes
    are available (as for slab).
  - Capable to display stereo image.
  - Capable to display other geometric objects, like membrane.
  - Atomic information is available for atom covered by the mouse
    pointer. No click required, just move the mouse pointer over the
    structure!
  - Capable to load more than one structure.
  - Capable to draw Ramachandran plot, helical wheel, Venn diagram,
    averaged hydrophobicity and hydrophobic moment plot.
  - The command prompt is available at the bottom of the main window.

Description: retrieve data from Garmin Forerunner/Edge GPS devices
 This package contains command-line tools to retrieve data from GPS
 devices from the Garmin Forerunner series (these are
 wristwatch-like devices that allow you to register your exact
 itinerary when doing outdoor sports) or the Garmin Edge series (the
 same for cycling computers). It works with the Forerunner 205 and 305
 models and with the Edge 305 model, and possibly others. Track data
 can be translated into an XML format and into gpx, and into a
 polyline format for use with Google maps.
 .
 In contrast to the gpsbabel software, this software also downloads
 data specific to usage in sports like maximal speed, lap summary,
 calorie consumption, etc.

Description: program for calculating and printing calendars
 Gcal displays a calendar for a month or a year, eternal holiday lists
 and fixed date lists, in many ways. The program correctly omits the
 dates that were skipped when the current Gregorian calendar replaced
 the earlier Julian calendar.
 .
 Apart from the usual and well known calendar functions like the
 output of a month or a year calendar sheet, or the output of an eternal
 holiday list, Gcal offers the facility to display fixed dates on the
 day of their occurrence and to remind or inform the user about them.
 So it is possible for users to receive an on-screen notification, at bootup
 or login, of all holidays or appointments which take place on that day.
 Notification by electronic mail is also possible.

Description: Utility to calculate long and short path to a location
 Gcb computes long and short path given the latitude and longitude
 (degrees and minutes). You must input the lat/long of the two stations.
 The output will then be relative from station1 to station2.
 .
 Gcb is used by hamradio operators as a tool for pointing the antenna
 in the right direction, either by using the short (daylight) propagation
 path or using the long path, which is almost always via the dark side
 of the earth.
 .
 Gcb believes the earth to be a perfect circle, which means there will be
 small calculation errors.

Description: GNU C compiler (cross compiler for MSP430)
 This is the GNU C compiler, a fairly portable optimizing compiler for C
 for TI's MSP430 architecture.  This package is primarily for MSP430
 developers and cross-compilers and is not needed by normal users.
 .
 BEWARE: due to a bug in the memory layout reference of FRAM-based chips,
 this package DOES NOT WORK with MSP430FR5xxx chips (eg. FraunchPad devkit).
 DO NOT use gcc-msp430 on that chip series, as you will lose access to
 JTAG and BSL, and permanently BRICK your chip!

 a C++ program from GCC's internal representation. Since XML is easy to
 parse, other development tools will be able to work with C++ programs
 without the burden of a complicated C++ parser.

Description: Educational games for small children
 A large collection of educational games for small children, designed
 to be a unified interface to integrate more educational games.
 .
 Language-oriented games contain vocabulary, sounds, and voices for many
 different languages; check the gcompris-sound packages for your
 language.
 .
 Currently available boards include:
  * learning how to use a mouse and keyboard
  * learning simple arithmetic
  * learning how to read an analog clock
  * recognize letters after hearing their names
  * reading practice
  * small games (memory games, jigsaw puzzles, ...)
  * etc.
 .
 It is designed so that it is easy to implement new boards.
 .
 A number of boards are only available if other packages are
 installed; see the Suggests list for more details.

 as a FITS viewer.
 .
 The program can control CCD cameras and telescopes, and implement
 automatic observation scripting. Cameras are controlled through a
 hardware-specific server, to which gcx connects through a TCP socket.
 It generates FITS files with comprehensive header information.

Description: Geospatial Data Abstraction Library - Utility programs
 GDAL is a translator library for raster geospatial data formats.
 As a library, it presents a single abstract data model to the
 calling application for all supported formats. The related OGR
 library (which lives within the GDAL source tree) provides
 a similar capability for simple features vector data.
 .
 GDAL supports 40+ popular data formats, including commonly used
 ones (GeoTIFF, JPEG, PNG and more) as well as the ones used in
 GIS and remote sensing software packages (ERDAS Imagine,
 ESRI Arc/Info, ENVI, PCI Geomatics). Also supported many remote
 sensing and scientific data distribution formats such as HDF,
 EOS FAST, NOAA L1B, NetCDF, FITS.
 .
 OGR library supports popular vector formats like ESRI Shapefile,
 TIGER data, S57, MapInfo File, DGN, GML and more.
 .
 This package contains utility programs, based on GDAL/OGR library,
 namely gdal_translate, gdalinfo, gdaladdo, gdalwarp, ogr2ogr, ogrinfo,
 ogrtindex.

Description: GNU data recovery tool
 The gddrescue tool copies data from one file or block device
 (hard disc, cdrom, etc) to another, trying hard to rescue data
 in case of read errors.
 .
 gddrescue does not truncate the output file if not asked to.
 So, every time you run it on the same output file, it tries to
 fill in the gaps.
 .
 The basic operation of gddrescue is fully automatic. That is,
 you don't have to wait for an error, stop the program, read the
 log, run it in reverse mode, etc. If you use the logfile
 feature of gddrescue, the data is rescued very efficiently (only
 the needed blocks are read). Also you can interrupt the rescue
 at any time and resume it later at the same point.
 .
 Automatic merging of backups: If you have two or more damaged
 copies of a file, cdrom, etc, and run gddrescue on all of them,
 one at a time, with the same output file, you will probably
 obtain a complete and error-free file. This is so because the
 probability of having damaged areas at the same places on
 different input files is very low. Using the logfile, only the
 needed blocks are read from the second and successive copies.
 .
 The logfile is periodically saved to disc. So in case of a crash
 you can resume the rescue with little recopying. Also, the same
 logfile can be used for multiple commands that copy different
 areas of the file, and for multiple recovery attempts over
 different subsets.
 .
 gddrescue aligns its I/O buffer to the sector size so that it
 can be used to read from raw devices. For efficiency reasons,
 also aligns it to the memory page size if page size is a
 multiple of sector size.
 .
 Please note that this is the GNU ddrescue version providing the
 ddrescue executable. The package is named gddrescue because the
 ddrescue version of Kurt Garloff used to have the ddrescue
 package name already.

 GdMap is a tool which allows you to visualize disk space. Ever

Description: fast and lightweight IDE
 Geany is a small and lightweight integrated development environment.
 It was developed to provide a small and fast IDE, which has only a
 few dependencies from other packages. It is using only the GTK2 toolkit
 and therefore you need only the GTK2 runtime libraries to run Geany.
 .
 The basic features of Geany are:
  - syntax highlighting
  - code completion
  - auto completion of constructs like if, for and while, XML and HTML
  - call tips
  - folding
  - many supported filetypes like C, Java, PHP, HTML, Python, Perl, Pascal
  - symbol lists
  - embedded terminal emulation

Description: miscellanous plugins for Geany
 This plugin adds various small addons to Geany which aren't worth an
 individual plugin, but might still be useful for people.
  * DocList: This addon places a new item in the toolbar and when clicked
    offers a menu listing all open files plus the 'Close All' and 'Close Other
    Documents' menu items. This can be useful to quickly access open files and
    switch to them.
  * OpenURI: Adds 'Open URI' and 'Copy URI' menu items to the editor menu when
    the word under the cursor looks like a URI. 'Open URI' uses the browser
    command configured in Geany to open it.
  * Tasks: The tasks plugin goes through a file being edited and picks out
    lines with "TODO" or "FIXME" in them. It collects the text after those words
    and puts them in a new "Tasks" tab in the message window. Clicking on a task
    in that tab takes you to the line in the file where the task was defined.
  * Systray: Adds a status icon to the notification area (systray) and
    provides a simple popup menu with some basic actions. It can also be used
    to quickly show and hide the Geany main window.

Description: auto-closing plugin for Geany
 This plugin enables auto-closing features. Auto-closing works while you typing
 and intellectually helps you to write code.
 .
 Features:
  * auto-close for: { }, [ ], ( ), " ", ' ', < >, ` `
  * customizeable auto-closing inside strings and comments
  * delete pairing character if you pressed BackSpace
  * suppress inserting one char twice (if you type "{}" you will get "{}", not
    "{}}")
  * enclose selected text into brackets instead of removing selection (select
    text and type "(" or ")" to enclose selection into "()")
  * keep selection when enclosing
  * for C-like languages enclosing selection into "{}" makes auto-indentation
    (select text and type "{" or "}" - text will be enclosed and indented)
  * enclosing in {} moves cursor to beginning (before "{" character)
  * for C-like languages to insert {}-block you do not need to select text
    precisely: plugin detects boundaries automatically, just ensure that
    selection covers lines you need to indent (works like TAB indentation)
  * fix auto-indent inside {} (makes full indent for this block)
  * auto-close curly bracket by pressing Enter
  * auto-close functions (``"sin(|" -> "sin(|);"``) with doubling suppression
    (for C/C++ languages only)
  * remove paring brace when pressing Shift+BackSpace, unindent {}-blocks
  * add semicolon after ``struct {|};`` and ``class {|};``
  * move cursor to closed char by pressing Tab

 gedit is a text editor which supports most standard editor features,
 extending this basic functionality with other features not usually
 found in simple text editors. gedit is a graphical application which
 supports editing multiple text files in one window (known sometimes as
 tabs or MDI).
 .
 gedit fully supports international text through its use of the Unicode
 UTF-8 encoding in edited files. Its core feature set includes syntax
 highlighting of source code, auto indentation and printing and print preview
 support.
 .
 gedit is also extensible through its plugin system, which currently
 includes support for spell checking, comparing files, viewing CVS
 ChangeLogs, and adjusting indentation levels.

Description: gedit plugin for composing and compiling LaTeX documents
 This plugin assist you in a number of task:
  - Code Completion: if you type a prefix it shows you all matching commands
    and the structure and meaning of their arguments. If possible it shows
    options for the argument the cursor is in.
  - Assistants: there are several assistants for frequent tasks like creating
    the body of a new LaTeX file, inserting a graphics, inserting a table or a
    matrix, inserting source code listings, inserting BibTeX entries.
  - BibTeX Integration: an outline view is created for BibTeX files and the
    LaTeX completion is aware of bibliographies included per \bibliography and
    proposes their entries at the \cite command. BibTeX entries may be inserted
    with the help of a dialog.
  - Build System: The build system uses profiles like "PDF", "DVI" or
    "PostScript". Per default the plugin uses rubber for automated document
    compiling, but you may create your own profiles invoking the LaTeX command
    chain directly.

Description: enhanced Scheme interaction mode for Emacs
 Geiser features an enhanced REPL and a set of minor modes improving
 Emacs' basic scheme major mode. The main functionalities provided
 are:
    - Evaluation of forms in the namespace of the current module.
    - Macro expansion.
    - File/module loading.
    - Namespace-aware identifier completion (including local bindings,
      names visible in the current module, and module names).
    - Autodoc: the echo area shows information about the signature of
      the procedure/macro around point automatically.
    - Jump to definition of identifier at point.
    - Access to documentation (including docstrings when the
      implementation provides it).
    - Listings of identifiers exported by a given module.
    - Listings of callers/callees of procedures.
    - Rudimentary support for debugging (list of
      evaluation/compilation error in an Emacs' compilation-mode
      buffer).
 .
 Currently supports Racket, or Guile 2.0
