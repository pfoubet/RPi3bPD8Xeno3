Description: Archiver component for Maven
 Maven is a software project management and comprehension tool. Based on the
 concept of a project object model (POM), Maven can manage a project's build,
 reporting and documentation from a central piece of information.
 .
 Maven's primary goal is to allow a developer to comprehend the complete
 state of a development effort in the shortest period of time. In order to
 attain this goal there are several areas of concern that Maven attempts
 to deal with:
 .
    * Making the build process easy
    * Providing a uniform build system
    * Providing quality project information
    * Providing guidelines for best practices development
    * Allowing transparent migration to new features
 .
 The Maven Archiver is mainly used by Maven plugins to handle packaging.

 state of a development effort in the shortest period of time. In order to
 attain this goal there are several areas of concern that Maven attempts
 to deal with:
 .
    * Making the build process easy
    * Providing a uniform build system
    * Providing quality project information
    * Providing guidelines for best practices development
    * Allowing transparent migration to new features
 .

Description: Maven Reporting API Implementation
 Maven is a software project management and comprehension tool. Based on the
 concept of a project object model (POM), Maven can manage a project's build,
 reporting and documentation from a central piece of information.
 .
 Maven's primary goal is to allow a developer to comprehend the complete
 state of a development effort in the shortest period of time. In order to
 attain this goal there are several areas of concern that Maven attempts
 to deal with:
 .
    * Making the build process easy
    * Providing a uniform build system
    * Providing quality project information
    * Providing guidelines for best practices development
    * Allowing transparent migration to new features
 .
 This package implements the Maven Reporting API.

Description: Maven Site Plugin for generating a site
 Maven is a software project management and comprehension tool. Based on the
 concept of a project object model (POM), Maven can manage a project's build,
 reporting and documentation from a central piece of information.
 .
 Maven's primary goal is to allow a developer to comprehend the complete
 state of a development effort in the shortest period of time. In order to
 attain this goal there are several areas of concern that Maven attempts
 to deal with:
 .
    * Making the build process easy
    * Providing a uniform build system
    * Providing quality project information
    * Providing guidelines for best practices development
    * Allowing transparent migration to new features
 .
 The Maven 2 Site Plugin is used to generate a site for the project. The
 generated site also includes the project's reports that were configured in the
 <reporting>  section of the POM.

Description: Maven Source Plugin
 The Maven 2 Source Plugin creates a JAR archive of the source files of
 the current project. The Source Plugin has five goals:
  * source:aggregate aggregrates sources for all modules in an aggregator
    project.
  * source:jar is used to bundle the main sources of the project into a
    jar archive.
  * source:test-jar on the other hand, is used to bundle the test sources
    of the project into a jar archive.
  * source:jar-no-fork is similar to jar but does not fork the build lifecycle.
  * source:test-jar-no-fork is similar to test-jar but does not fork the
    build lifecycle.

Description: memory-based tagger-generator and tagger - runtime
 MBT is a memory-based tagger-generator and tagger in one. The tagger-generator
 part can generate a sequence tagger on the basis of a training set of tagged
 sequences; the tagger part can tag new sequences. MBT can, for instance, be
 used to generate part-of-speech taggers or chunkers for natural language
 processing.
 .
 MBT is a product of the ILK Research Group (Tilburg University, The
 Netherlands) and the CLiPS Research Centre (University of Antwerp, Belgium).
 .
 If you do scientific research in natural language processing, MBT will
 likely be of use to you.
 .
 This package provides the runtime files required to run programs that use
 libmbt.

Description: Many-Core Engine for Perl providing parallel processing capabilities
 Many-core Engine (MCE) for Perl helps enable a new level of performance
 by maximizing all available cores. MCE spawns a pool of workers and
 therefore does not fork a new process per each element of data. Instead,
 MCE follows a bank queuing model. Imagine the line being the data and
 bank-tellers the parallel workers. MCE enhances that model by adding the
 ability to chunk the next n elements from the input stream to the next
 available worker.
 .
 Chunking and input data are optional in MCE. One may use MCE to run many
 workers in parallel without specifying input data.

Description: abstraction library to store configuration settings
 Modular Config System is a library and set of tools which abstract the
 storage of configuration settings away from userland applications.
 .
 It is hoped that by using mcs, that the applications which use it will
 generally have a more congruent feeling in regards to settings.
 .
 Highlights:
  * Cleanly implemented BSD-licenced code.
  * Simple, elegant, non-intrusive programming interface.
  * Modular design allows for third-party configuration backends to be
    implemented without any extra effort on the part of the development
    process of your products.
  * Dummy configuration backend which pretends that the configuration is
    blank.
  * Robust object-oriented design implemented as low-footprint C, mcs only
    adds a ~20KB memory footprint to your application.
  * XDG Base Directory spec compliance.
  * GConf support.
  * It's fast.

Description: Multi Dimension Data structure library -- headers
 A collection of multi-dimensional data structure and indexing algorithm.
 .
 This is a C++ library, and is a collection of various data structures designed
 to efficiently store and query multi-dimensional data for various
 filtering criteria. Different structures are optimized for different
 query needs.
 .
 This library is a source-code only library. It’s designed to be
 header-only meaning that the user program does not need to link to any
 additional shared library in order to use these data structures. The
 data structures are all available as C++ templates.

Description: development headers for libmemcache C client API
 memcached optimizes specific high-load serving applications that are designed
 to take advantage of its versatile no-locking memory access system.  Clients
 are available in several different programming languages, to suit the needs
 of the specific application.  Traditionally this has been used in mod_perl
 apps to avoid storing large chunks of data in Apache memory, and to share
 this burden across several machines.
 .
 Danga Interactive developed memcached to enhance the speed of
 LiveJournal.com, a site which was already doing 20 million+ dynamic page
 views per day for 1 million users with a bunch of webservers and a bunch of
 database servers.  memcached dropped the database load to almost nothing,
 yielding faster page load times for users, better resource utilization, and
 faster access to the databases on a memcache miss.

 .
 It can be used as a replacement of libgnome-menu of gnome-menus:
 .
  * Shorten time for loading menu entries.
  * Ease of use (API is very similar to that of libgnome-menu).
  * Lightweight runtime library (parsing of the menu definition files
    are done by menu-cache-gen when the menus are really changed).
  * Less unnecessary and complicated file monitoring.
  * Heavily reduced disk I/O.

Description: WorldForge terrain library
 Mercator is primarily aimed at terrain for multiplayer online games and
 forms one of the WorldForge core libraries.
 It is intended to be used as a terrain library on the client, while a
 subset of features are useful on the server.
 .
 Mercator is designed in such a way that individual tiles can be
 generated on-the-fly from a very small source data set.  Each tile uses
 a fast deterministic random number generation to ensure that identical
 results are produced "anytime, anywhere".  This enables transmission of
 terrain across low bandwidth links as part of the standard data stream,
 or server side collision detection with the same terrain that the
 player sees.
 .
 The use of tiles means that there is inherently a large degree of gross
 control of the shape of the terrain.  Finer control is implemented by
 allowing geometric modifications - for example, a polygonal area might
 be flattened, or a crater could be applied.

Description: WorldForge terrain library - development files
 Mercator is primarily aimed at terrain for multiplayer online games and
 forms one of the WorldForge core libraries.
 It is intended to be used as a terrain library on the client, while a
 subset of features are useful on the server.
 .
 Mercator is designed in such a way that individual tiles can be
 generated on-the-fly from a very small source data set.  Each tile uses
 a fast deterministic random number generation to ensure that identical
 results are produced "anytime, anywhere".  This enables transmission of
 terrain across low bandwidth links as part of the standard data stream,
 or server side collision detection with the same terrain that the
 player sees.
 .
 The use of tiles means that there is inherently a large degree of gross
 control of the shape of the terrain.  Finer control is implemented by
 allowing geometric modifications - for example, a polygonal area might
 be flattened, or a crater could be applied.
 .
 This package contains the files for developing with the mercator library.

Description: library for performing operations on matrices and vectors
 Meschach is a library of routines written in C for matrix
 computations. These include operations for basic numerical linear
 algebra; routines for matrix factorisations; solving systems of
 equations; solving least squares problems; computing eigenvalues,
 eigenvectors and singular values;sparse matrix computations including
 both direct and iterative methods. This package makes use of the
 features of the C programming language: data structures, dynamic
 memory allocation and deallocation, pointers, functions as parameters
 and objects. Meschach has a number of self-contained data structures
 for matrices, vectors and other mathematical objects.

Description: input and output messages to ZeroMQ
 Message::Passing::ZeroMQ is a ZeroMQ transport for Message::Passing.
 .
 Designed for use as a log transport and aggregation mechanism for perl
 applications, allowing you to aggregate structured and non-structured
 log messages across the network in a non-blocking manner.
 .
 Clients (i.e. users of the Message::Passing::Output::ZeroMQ class)
 connect to a server (i.e. a user of the Message::Passing::Input::ZeroMQ
 class) via ZeroMQ's pub/sub sockets. These are setup to be lossy and
 non-blocking, meaning that if the log-receiver process is down or slow,
 then the application will queue a small (and configurable) amount of
 logs on its side, and after that log messages will be dropped.
 .
 Whilst throwing away log messages isn't a good thing to do, or
 something that you want to happen regularly, in many (especially web
 application) contexts, network logging being a single point of failure
 is not acceptable from a reliability and graceful degradation
 standpoint.
 .
 The application grinding to a halt as a non-essential centralised
 resource is unavailable (e.g. the log aggregation server) is
 significantly less acceptable than the loss of non-essential logging
 data.

Description: tool for creating Meta objects to track custom metrics
 Meta programming is becoming more and more popular. The popularity of Meta
 programming comes from the fact that many problems are made significantly
 easier. There are a few specialized Meta tools out there, for instance
 Class:MOP which is used by Moose to track class metadata.
 .
 Meta::Builder is designed to be a generic tool for writing Meta objects.
 Unlike specialized tools, Meta::Builder makes no assumptions about what
 metrics you will care about. Meta::Builder also mkaes it simple for others to
 extend your meta-object based tools by providing hooks for other packages to
 add metrics to your meta object.
 .
 If a specialized Meta object tool is available to meet your needs please use
 it. However if you need a simple Meta object to track a couple metrics, use
 Meta::Builder.

Description: Create method aliases
 The traditional way to create a method alias (provide an alternate
 name for a method) is simply a GLOB alias.  While this works fine for
 functions, it does not work for methods overloaded by a subclass.
 .
 Instead, Method::Alias creates a number of methods in the caller's
 package to call the real method. It is designed to be used as a pragma,
 to which you provide a set of pairs of method names.

 an HTTP server as part of another application. Key features that distinguish
 GNU Libmicrohttpd from other projects are:
  * C library: fast and small
  * API is simple, expressive and fully reentrant
  * Implementation is HTTP 1.1 compliant
  * HTTP server can listen on multiple ports
  * Four different threading models (select, poll, pthread, thread pool)
  * Support for IPv6
  * Support for SHOUTcast
  * Support for incremental processing of POST data (optional)
  * Support for basic and digest authentication (optional)
  * Support for SSL3 and TLS
 .

Description: camlp4 extension for pattern matching with regexps - runtime
 Mikmatch provides enhanced pattern matching with regexps for OCaml.
 .
 The goal of Mikmatch is to make text-oriented programs even easier to write,
 read and run without losing the unique and powerful features of OCaml.
 Mikmatch provides a concise and highly readable syntax for regular
 expressions, and integrates it into the syntax of OCaml thanks to Camlp4.
 .
 The implementation of Mikmatch consists essentially of:
  * a library which is loaded by the OCaml preprocessor (Camlp4) and
    defines sophisticated "macros", i.e. the modified syntax;
  * a traditional library (runtime) which is required by the programs that
    use the Mikmatch syntax;
  * a dedicated 'mikmatch' command which can be used as a replacement for
    'ocaml' in scripts or as an interactive toplevel. It performs automatically
    these steps: preprocessing, compilation and execution.
 .
 This package contains the shared runtime libraries.

Description: Perl version of Python's URL-safe base64 codec
 MIME::Base64::URLSafe is a perl version of python's URL-safe base64 encoder /
 decoder.
 .
 When embedding binary data in URL, it is preferable to use base64 encoding.
 However, two characters ('+' and '/') used in the standard base64 encoding have
 special meanings in URLs, often leading to re-encoding with URL-encoding, or
 worse, interoperability problems.
 .
 To overcome the problem, the module provides a variation of base64 codec
 compatible with python's urlsafe_b64encode / urlsafe_b64decode

Description: Perl interface to deal with RFC 2047 encoded words
 MIME::EncWords is a module providing several utilities to encode and decode
 arbitrary text in RFC 2047 (formerly RFC 1522) format. The MIME standard gives
 users the ability to represent any characters in any character set by using
 special sequences like:
 .
  =?ISO-8859-1?Q?Keld_J=F8rn_Simonsen?=
 .
 There are various modules available to manipulate these special character
 sequences. This module bears most resemblance to the MIME::Words module and
 provides a similar interface, providing for relatively painless upgrading,
 while having stricter conformance to the aforementioned RFCs. It provides
 more flexibility than MIME::WordDecoder because characters can be mapped
 into any desired encoding, rather than simply the local system representation.

Description: MNI medical image format development environment
 This package contains the library and headers for libminc2 and
 libvolume_io2.
 .
 The Minc file format is a highly flexible medical image file format.
 Minc version 1 is built on top of the NetCDF generalized data format.
 Minc version 2 is built on top of the HDF data format.  This library
 handles both formats.  In each case the format is
 simple, self-describing, extensible, portable and N-dimensional, with
 programming interfaces for both low-level data access and high-level
 volume manipulation. On top of the libraries is a suite of generic
 image-file manipulation tools. The format, libraries and tools are
 designed for use in a medical-imaging research environment : they are
 simple and powerful and make no attempt to provide a pretty interface
 to users.

 solution to support the "Internet Gateway Device" part of the protocol. The
 MediaServer/MediaRenderer UPnP protocol is also becoming very popular.
 .
 Miniupnpc aims at the simplest library possible, with the smallest footprint
 and no dependencies to other libraries such as XML parsers or HTTP
 implementations. All the code is pure ANSI C. Compiled on a x86 PC, the
 miniupnp client library have less than 15KB code size. For instance, the upnpc
 sample program is around 20KB. The miniupnp daemon is much smaller than any
 other IGD daemon and is ideal for using on low memory device for this reason.

Description: nonlinear equations and nonlinear least squares shared library
 Minpack includes software for solving nonlinear equations and
 nonlinear least squares problems.  Five algorithmic paths each include
 a core subroutine and an easy-to-use driver.  The algorithms proceed
 either from an analytic specification of the Jacobian matrix or
 directly from the problem functions.  The paths include facilities for
 systems of equations with a banded Jacobian matrix, for least squares
 problems with a large amount of data, and for checking the consistency
 of the Jacobian matrix with the functions.

Description: module to add extra stashes of data to objects
 Mixin::ExtraFields is a Perl module that provides a simple way to add an
 arbitrary number of stashes for named data. These data can be stored in the
 object, in a database, or anywhere else. The storage mechanism is abstracted
 away from the provided interface, so one storage mechanism can be easily
 swapped for another. Multiple ExtraFields stashes can be mixed into one
 class, using one or many storage mechanisms.

Description: module for storing multidimensional hash structures in perl tied hashes
 The MLDBM perl module can be used to store multidimensional hash structures
 in tied hashes (including DBM files).
 .
 It depends on the Data::Dumper module and by default uses the
 SDBM tied hash. But you can use it with DB_File (and others
 DBM modules). You can also use other serializing packages
 like Storable and FreezeThaw.

Description: minimalistic Netlink communication library (devel)
 libmnl is a minimalistic user-space library oriented to Netlink developers.
 There are a lot of common tasks in parsing, validating, constructing of
 both the Netlink header and TLVs that are repetitive and easy to get wrong.
 This library aims to provide simple helpers that allows you to re-use code
 and to avoid re-inventing the wheel.
 .
 The main features of this library are:
 .
 Small: the shared library requires around 30KB for an x86-based computer.
 .
 Simple: this library avoids complexity and elaborated abstractions that
 tend to hide Netlink details.
 .
 Easy to use: the library simplifies the work for Netlink-wise developers.
 It provides functions to make socket handling, message building,
 validating, parsing and sequence tracking, easier.
 .
 Easy to re-use: you can use the library to build your own abstraction
 layer on top of this library.
 .
 Decoupling: the interdependency of the main bricks that compose the
 library is reduced, i.e. the library provides many helpers, but the
 programmer is not forced to use them.

Description: minimalistic Netlink communication library
 libmnl is a minimalistic user-space library oriented to Netlink developers.
 There are a lot of common tasks in parsing, validating, constructing of
 both the Netlink header and TLVs that are repetitive and easy to get wrong.
 This library aims to provide simple helpers that allows you to re-use code
 and to avoid re-inventing the wheel.
 .
 The main features of this library are:
 .
 Small: the shared library requires around 30KB for an x86-based computer.
 .
 Simple: this library avoids complexity and elaborated abstractions that
 tend to hide Netlink details.
 .
 Easy to use: the library simplifies the work for Netlink-wise developers.
 It provides functions to make socket handling, message building,
 validating, parsing and sequence tracking, easier.
 .
 Easy to re-use: you can use the library to build your own abstraction
 layer on top of this library.
 .
 Decoupling: the interdependency of the main bricks that compose the
 library is reduced, i.e. the library provides many helpers, but the
 programmer is not forced to use them.
 .
 This package contains the shared libraries needed to run programs that use
 the minimalistic Netlink communication library.

Description: Perl module for quick side-effect free mocking of objects and classes
 Mock::Quick is here to solve the current problems with Mocking libraries.
 .
 There are a couple Mocking libraries available on CPAN. The primary
 problems with these libraries include verbose syntax, and most
 importantly side-effects. Some Mocking libraries expect you to mock a
 specific class, and will unload it then redefine it. This is
 particularly a problem if you only want to override a class on a
 lexical level.
 .
 Mock::Quick provides a declarative mocking interface that results in a
 very concise, but clear syntax. There are separate facilities for
 mocking object instances, and classes. You can quickly create an
 instance of an object with custom attributes and methods. You can also
 quickly create an anonymous class, optionally inhereting from another,
 with whatever methods you desire.
 .
 Mock::Quick also provides a tool that provides an OO interface to
 overriding methods in existing classes. This tool also allows for the
 restoration of the original class methods. Best of all this is a
 localized tool, when your control object falls out of scope the original
 class is restored.

Description: module to use real libraries from within mocked libraries
 When mocking modules using 'mocked', you are certain that no extra "real"
 libraries are being loaded.  But sometimes you don't want to use real
 libraries from within your mocked library.  This module allows you to load
 real libraries using your previous include paths.

Description: module for enabling all of the features of Modern Perl
 Modern Perl programs use several modules to enable additional features of
 Perl and of the CPAN. Instead of copying and pasting all of these 'use'
 lines, instead write only one:
 .
    use Modern::Perl;
 .
 This enables the strict and warnings pragmas, as well as all of the features
 available since Perl 5.10.
 .
 For enabling features of newer Perl releases, a year can be specified as an
 import tag, e.g.:
 .
    use Modern::Perl '2014';
 .
 enables 5.18 features. Cf. Modern::Perl(3pm) for details.
 .

 more information, http://www.modernperlbooks.com/ for further discussion of
 Modern Perl and its implications, and

Description: module for removing the old module before installing the new one
 Module::Build::CleanInstall is a subclass of Module::Build with one
 additional feature, before upgrading the module from and old version to a new
 one, it first removes the files installed by the previous version. This is
 useful especially when the new version will not contain some files that the
 old one did, and it is necessary that those files do not remain in place.
 .
 Since it is a subclass of Module::Build it is used exactly like that module.
 Module::Build::CleanInstall does provide an additional action uninstall, but
 it need not be called separately; the action install will call it when
 invoked.
 .
 The uninstalling is done by removing the files in the installed module's
 packlist which is created when the module is first installed.

Description: framework for building and installing Perl modules
 Module::Build is a framework for easily building, testing and installing Perl
 packages. It is meant as a next-generation replacement for ExtUtils::MakeMaker
 and offers many additional features characteristic of a more modern install
 system, including simple subclassing for custom build actions.
 .
 Because it is written in Pure Perl, it has very few external dependencies. In
 particular, it allows for installation of packages on systems without 'make'
 and will even work without a shell. Its only prerequisites are modules that
 are included with perl 5.6.0 and it is core as of perl 5.10.

Description: module to determine modules shipped with perl
 Module::CoreList is a Perl module that can provide various information about
 the versions of Perl modules that shipped with perl interpreter releases.
 .
 It contains a hash of hashes which is keyed on the perl interpreter version,
 as indicated in $]. The second level hash has pairs of modules and as well as
 their versions. It's possible that the version of a module is unspecified, in
 which case it will be undef.
 .
 Other features include a hash providing ISO formatted versions of the release

Description: format for describing CPAN dependencies of Perl applications
 Module::CPANfile is a tool to handle cpanfile format to load application
 specific dependencies, not just for CPAN distributions.
 .
 `cpanfile` describes CPAN dependencies required to execute associated Perl
 code.
 .
 Place the `cpanfile` in the root of the directory containing the associated
 code. For instance, in a Catalyst application, place the `cpanfile` in the
 same directory as `myapp.conf`.
 .
 Tools supporting `cpanfile` format (e.g. cpanm and carton) will automatically
 detect the file and install dependencies for the code to run.

Description: Perl module to generate Kwalitee ratings for a distribution
 Module::CPANTS::Analyse is a utility module used by Test::Kwalitee and others
 to analyse CPAN distributions and determine their Kwalitee. Kwalitee is a set
 of software metrics useful for determine how good your software is; it's not
 true software quality, which your computer can't measure in a general sense.
 (If you can, you've solved a hard problem in computer science.)
 .
 Kwalitee looks like quality, sounds like quality, but it's not quite quality.
 If you plan to release a distribution to the CPAN -- or even within your own
 organization -- testing its Kwalitee before creating a release can help you
 improve your quality as well.

Description: declare author-only dependencies
 Modules often have optional requirements, for example dependencies that
 are useful for (optional) tests, but not required for the module to
 work properly.
 .
 Usually you want all developers of a project to have these optional
 modules installed. However, simply telling everyone or printing
 diagnostic messages if optional dependencies are missing often isn't
 enough to make sure all authors have all optional modules installed.
 .
 Module::Install already has a way of detecting an author environment,
 so an easy way to achieve the above would be something like:
 .
  if ($Module::Install::AUTHOR) {
    requires 'Some::Module';
    requires 'Another::Module' => '0.42';
  }
 .
 Unfortunately, that'll also make the optional dependencies show up in
 the distributions "META.yml" file, which is obviously wrong, as they
 aren't actually hard requirements.
 .
 Working that around requires a considerable amount of non-trivial
 Makefile.PL hackery, or simply using Module::Install::AuthorRequires's
 "author_requires" command.

Description: write your distribution change log in RDF
 Resource Description Framework (RDF) is a standard model for data
 interchange on the Web.
 .
 Module::Install::DOAPChangeSets allows you to write your Changes file
 in Turtle or RDF/XML and autogenerate a human-readable text file.
 .
 To do this, create an RDF file called "meta/changes.ttl" (or something
 like that) and describe your distribution's changes in RDF using the
 Dublin Core, DOAP, and DOAP Change Sets vocabularies. Then in your
 Makefile.PL, include:
 .
  write_doap_changes "meta/changes.ttl", "Changes", "turtle";
 .
 This line will read your data from the file named as the first
 argument, parse it using either Turtle or RDFXML parsers (the third
 argument), and output a human-readable changelog to the file named as
 the second argument.

 Module::Install::ExtraTests adds one Module::Install command:
 .
  extra_tests;
 .
 This declares that the test files found in the directory ./xt should be
 run only in certain instances:
 .
  ./xt/author  - run when tests are being run in an author's working copy
  ./xt/smoke   - run when the dist is being smoked (AUTOMATED_TESTING=1)
  ./xt/release - run during "make disttest"
 .
 These directories are recurisvely scanned for *.t files.  If any
 directories or files exist in ./xt that are not recognized, the
 Makefile.PL will die.

 .
 You can add your own custom entries at the top of the "MANIFEST" file.
 Just put a blank line after your entries, and they will be left alone.

Description: framework for installing Perl modules
 Module::Install is a package for writing installers for CPAN (or CPAN-like)
 distributions that are clean, simple, minimalist, act in a strictly correct
 manner with ExtUtils::MakeMaker. It will run on any Perl installation version
 5.004 or newer.
 .
 It is designed to automatically include a copy of itself with modules that
 use it, thus ensuring that bleeding-edge features will be available for use
 in Makefile.PL in a simple and portable way. It is simple to learn, and has
 the same features as ExtUtils::MakeMaker and Module::Build. However, it has
 the advantage that it requires no installation for end-users.

 also allows you to write out a combined graph using Turtle.

 Module::Manifest is a simple utility module created originally for use in

 It allows you to load the MANIFEST file that comes in a Perl distribution
 tarball, examine the contents, and perform some simple tasks.
 .
 Granted, the functionality needed to do this is quite simple, but the Perl
 distribution MANIFEST specification contains a couple of little
 idiosyncracies, such as line comments and space-seperated inline comments.
 .
 The use of this module means that any little nigglies are dealt with behind
 the scenes, and you can concentrate the main task at hand.

Description: MANIFEST.SKIP management for Perl modules
 Module::Manifest::Skip is mostly intended for module packaging
 frameworks to share a common, up-to-date "MANIFEST.SKIP" base. For
 example, Module::Install::ManifestSkip, uses this module to get the
 actual SKIP content. However this module may be useful for any module
 author.
 .
 CPAN module authors use a MANIFEST.SKIP file to exclude certain well
 known files from getting put into a generated MANIFEST file, which
 would cause them to go into the final distribution package.
 .
 The packaging tools try to automatically skip things for you, but if
 you add one of your own entries, you have to add all the common ones
 yourself. This module attempts to make all of this boring process as
 simple and reliable as possible.
 .
 Module::Manifest::Skip can create or update a MANIFEST.SKIP file for
 you. You can add your own entries, and it will leave them alone. You
 can even tell it to not skip certain entries that it normally skips,
 although this is rarely needed.

 When used as a Module::Starter plugin, this module allows you to specify a
 simple directory of templates which are filled in with module-specific
 information, and thereafter form the basis of your new module.
 .
 The default templates that this module initially provides are based on the
 recommendations in the book "Perl Best Practices" by Damian Conway.

Description: Report versions of all modules in memory
 The author says: "I often get email from someone reporting a bug in a
 module I've written. I email back, asking what version of the module
 it is, what version of Perl on what OS, and sometimes what version of
 some relevant third library (like XML::Parser). They reply, saying
 "Perl5". I say "I need the exact version, as reported by 'perl -v'".
 They tell me. And I say "I, uh, also asked about the version of my
 module and XML::Parser [or whatever]". They say "Oh yeah. It is 2.27".
 "Is that my module or XML::Parser?" "XML::Parser." "OK, and what
 about my module's version?" "Oh yeah. That's 3.11." By this time,
 days have passed, and what should have been a simple operation --
 reporting the version of Perl and relevant modules, has been
 needlessly complicated".
 .
 This module is for simplifying that task. If you add "use
 Module::Versions::Report;" to a program (especially handy if your
 program is one that demonstrates a bug in some module), then when the
 program has finished running, you well get a report detailing all the
 modules in memory, and noting the version of each (for modules that
 defined a $VERSION, at least).

Description: module to check @INC only once for wanted modules
 Sometimes you want to lazy load a module for use in, say, a loop or function.
 First you do the eval-require but then realize if the module is not available
 it will re-search @INC each time. So then you add a lexical boolean to your
 eval and do the same simple logic all over the place.
 .
 Module::Want encapsulates that logic so that have_mod() is like eval {
 require X; 1 } but if the module can't be loaded it will remember that fact
 and not look in @INC again on subsequent calls.

Description: module to make authorization a bit easier for Mojolicious
 Mojolicious::Plugin::Authorization provides a very simple API implementation
 of role-cbased access control (RBAC). This plugin is only an API you will
 have to do all the work of setting up your roles and privileges and then
 provide four subs that are used by the plugin. The plugin expects that the
 current session will be used to get the role its privileges. It also assumes
 that you have already been authenticated and your role set. That is about it
 you are free to implement any system you like.

Description: flexible ORM module for MongoDB databases
 MongoDBx::Class Perl module is a flexible object relational mapper
 (ORM) for MongoDB databases. Given a schema-like collection of
 document classes, MongoDBx::Class expands MongoDB objects (hash-refs
 in Perl) from the database into objects of those document classes, and
 collapses such objects back to the database.
 .
 MongoDBx::Class takes advantage of the fact that Perl's MongoDB driver
 is Moose-based to extend and tweak the driver's behavior, instead of
 wrapping it. This means MongoDBx::Class does not define its own
 syntax, so you simply use it exactly as you would the MongoDB driver
 directly. That said, MongoDBx::Class adds some sugar that enhances and
 simplifies the syntax unobtrusively (either use it or don't). Thus, it
 is relatively easy to convert your current MongoDB applications to
 MongoDBx::Class. A collection in MongoDBx::Class
 isa('MongoDB::Collection'), a database in MongoDBx::Class
 isa('MongoDB::Database'), etc.

Description: addin framework for extensible CLI applications/libraries
 Mono.Addins is a framework for creating extensible CLI applications, and for
 creating libraries which extend those applications.
 Mono.Addins has been designed to be easy to use and useful for a wide range
 of applications: from simple applications with small extensibility needs, to
 complex applications which need support for large add-in structures.
 .
 This new framework intends to set an standard for building extensible
 applications and add-ins in Mono.
 .
 This package contains the Mono.Addins assemblies.

Description: Mono SIMD (for CLI 2.0)
 Mono is a platform for running and developing applications based on the
 ECMA/ISO Standards. Mono is an open source effort led by Xamarin.
 Mono provides a complete CLR (Common Language Runtime) including compiler and
 runtime, which can produce and execute CIL (Common Intermediate Language)
 bytecode (aka assemblies), and a class library.
 .
 This package contains the Mono.Simd library for CLI 2.0, which provides a
 number of classes that are hardware accelerated by mapping the classes and
 the actual operations to native SIMD instructions on a processor.

Description: Mono System.ServiceModel.Web Library (for CLI 4.0)
 Mono is a platform for running and developing applications based on the
 ECMA/ISO Standards. Mono is an open source effort led by Xamarin.
 Mono provides a complete CLR (Common Language Runtime) including compiler and
 runtime, which can produce and execute CIL (Common Intermediate Language)
 bytecode (aka assemblies), and a class library.
 .
 This package contains the System.ServiceModel.Web library which is part of
 the Windows Communication Foundation (WCF) libraries of Mono for CLI 4.0.
 The WFC stack is for building SOA-based applications.
 Its development is in early stages.

Description: Mono WCF libraries (for CLI 2.0)
 Mono is a platform for running and developing applications based on the
 ECMA/ISO Standards. Mono is an open source effort led by Xamarin.
 Mono provides a complete CLR (Common Language Runtime) including compiler and
 runtime, which can produce and execute CIL (Common Intermediate Language)
 bytecode (aka assemblies), and a class library.
 .
 This package contains the Windows Communication Foundation (WCF) libraries
 of Mono for CLI 2.0. The WFC stack is for building SOA-based applications.
 Its development is in early stages.
 .
 WCF is also used in Moonlight, but it cuts down huge parts of .NET 3.0
 features but this implementation used by Moonlight should be almost feature
 complete.

Description: CLI library for multicast DNS service discovery
 Mono.Zeroconf is a cross platform Zero Configuration Networking library for
 Mono and .NET. It provides a unified API for performing the most common
 zeroconf operations on a variety of platforms and subsystems: all the
 operating systems supported by Mono and both the Avahi and
 Bonjour/mDNSResponder transports.
 .
 By using Mono.ZeroConf applications can use a single API that will work
 regardless of the underlying implementation that a particular operating
 system uses.
 .
 Applications can publish services that will be exposed to other computers on
 the network and also query the local machines on the network for services
 that could have been exposed.
 .
 This package contains development files for the Mono.Zeroconf library, and
 should be used for compilation

Description: modern Perl object system framework
 Moose is an extension of the Perl 5 object system. The main goal of Moose is to
 make Perl 5 Object Oriented programming easier, more consistent, and less
 tedious. With Moose you can think more about what you want to do and less about
 the mechanics of OOP.
 .
 Additionally, Moose is built on top of Class::MOP, which is a metaclass system
 for Perl 5. This means that Moose not only makes building normal Perl 5 objects
 better, but it provides the power of metaclass programming as well.
 .
 Moose also conveniently manages all attributes (including inherited ones) that
 are defined, but also provides facilities for properly initializing instance
 slots, setting defaults where appropriate and performing any necessary type
 constraint checking or coercion.
 .
 More details about the structure of Moose as well as its features can be found
 in the ever-expanding Moose::Cookbook document.

Description: Moose extension providing shorthands for common attribute options
 Ever found yourself repeatedly specifying writers and builders, because
 there's no good shortcut to specifying them? Sometimes you want an
 attribute to have a read-only public interface, but a private writer. And
 wouldn't it be easier to just say "builder => 1" and have the attribute
 construct the canonical "_build_$name" builder name for you?
 .
 MooseX::AttributeShortcuts causes an attribute trait to be applied to all
 attributes  defined to the using class. This trait extends the attribute
 option processing to handle the above variations.

Description: module to declare class attributes Moose-style
 MooseX::ClassAttribute allows you to declare class attributes in exactly the
 same way as object attributes, using class_has() instead of has().
 .
 You can use any feature of Moose's attribute declarations, including
 overriding a parent's attributes, delegation (handles), attribute traits,
 etc. All features should just work. The one exception is the "required" flag,
 which is not allowed for class attributes.
 .
 The accessor methods for class attribute may be called on the class directly,
 or on objects of that class. Passing a class attribute to the constructor
 will not set that attribute.

Description: Moose extension for processing command line options
 MooseX::Getopt is a Moose role which provides an alternate constructor for

 automatically discovers command line parameters by introspecting your class
 attributes, using the name of your attribute as the command line option. If
 there is a type constraint defined, it will configure Getopt::Long to handle
 the option accordingly.
 .
 By default, attributes beginning with an underscore are considered private and
 are not given commandline argument support, unless the attribute's metaclass
 is set to MooseX::Getopt::Meta::Attribute. You can also use this behaviour to
 get non-default commandline option names and aliases.

Description: moose extension to ark overload code symbols as methods
 MooseX::MarkAsMethods is a Perl module that allows one to easily mark
 certain functions as Moose methods. This will allow other packages
 such as namespace::autoclean to operate without blowing away your
 overloads. After using MooseX::MarkAsMethods your overloads will be
 recognized by Class::MOP as being methods, and class extension as well
 as composition from roles with overloads will "just work".
 .
 By default this module checks for overloads, and marks those functions
 as methods.
 .
 namespace::autoclean will be invoked to clear out non-methods when
 'autoclean => 1' is passed to import or use.

Description: Moose extension providing parameterized roles
 MooseX::Role::Parameterized is a Moose extension that consists of two things:
 parameter declarations and a role block.
 .
 Parameters are declared using the "parameter" keyword which resembles Moose's
 "has", even supporting any option that "has" accepts. You can use any option
 that "has" accepts. The default value for the "is" option is read-only, as
 that's a very common case. These parameters will get their values when the
 consuming class (or role) uses Moose's "with". A parameter object will be
 constructed with these values, and passed to the role block.

 (which have the same name as the attribute) and mutators (via set_ methods).
 .
 It is compatible with existing naming schemes, since attributes that explicitly
 provide a "reader" or "writer" name are left unchanged. The terminology
 "semi-affordance" is inspired by David Wheeler's Class::Meta module (see
 libclass-meta-perl).

Description: module providing write-once, read-many attributes for Moose
 MooseX::SetOnce provides the SetOnce attribute which lets your class have
 attributes that are not lazy and not set, but that cannot be altered once
 set.
 .
 The logic is very simple: if you try to alter the value of an attribute with
 the SetOnce trait, either by accessor or writer, and the attribute has a
 value, it will throw an exception.
 .
 If the attribute has a clearer, you may clear the attribute and set it again.

 MooseX::Types allows developers to organise and selectively import your own

 types are global. As a nice side effect, it catches typographic errors at
 compile-time too.
 .
 The main motivation for this module is to provide an easy way of preventing
 conflicts with your type names, since the internal fully qualified names of
 the types will be prefixed with the library's name. It also provides some
 convenient functions for working with Moose types.

Description: Perl module providing a Set::Object type
 MooseX::Types::Set::Object provides Moose type constraint (see MooseX::Types
 and Moose::Util::TypeConstraints) that is a Set::Object, with coercions. It
 is essentially a collection of unordered objects without duplication (see
 Set Theory in Mathematics).
 .
 Similarly, it allows one to operate on these sets - determining their union,
 intersection, difference and symmetric difference in a trivial way. There are
 many more operations, which are discussed in Set::Object's documentation.

  - to write Moo code that can later be converted to use the

Description: simple lightweight record-like structures making sounds like cows
 MooX::Struct allows you to create cheap struct-like classes for your
 data using Moo.
 .
 While similar in spirit to MooseX::Struct and Class::Struct,
 MooX::Struct has a somewhat different usage pattern. Rather than
 providing you with a "struct" keyword which can be used to define
 structs, you define all the structs as part of the "use" statement.
 This means they happen at compile time.
 .
 A struct is just an "anonymous" Moo class. MooX::Struct creates this
 class for you, and installs a lexical alias for it in your namespace.
 Thus your module can create a "Point3D" struct, and some other module
 can too, and they won't interfere with each other. All struct classes
 inherit from MooX::Struct.

Description: lightweight object framework for Perl
 Mouse is a lightweight Perl object framework based largely on the techniques
 created for Moose, the leading Perl framework for painless OO class creation.
 It is designed to be similar in functionality to Moose, though faster, by only
 providing a subset of Moose's functionality, alleviating some of the compile-
 time penalty incurred by Moose. It also has considerably less dependencies.

Description: abstract Mouse role for setting attributes from a configfile
 MouseX::ConfigFromFile is an abstract role which provides an alternate
 constructor for creating objects using parameters passed in from a
 configuration file. The actual implementation of reading the configuration
 file is left to concrete subroles.
 .
 It declares an attribute configfile and a class method new_with_config, and
 requires that concrete roles derived from it implement the class method
 get_config_from_file.
 .
 Attributes specified directly as arguments to new_with_config supercede those
 in the configfile.

Description: Mouse role for processing command line options
 MouseX::Getopt is a role which provides an alternate constructor for creating
 objects using parameters passed in from the command line.
 .
 MouseX::Getopt attempts to DWIM as much as possible with the command line
 params by introspecting your class's attributes. It will use the name of your
 attribute as the command line option, and if there is a type constraint
 defined, it will configure Getopt::Long to handle the option accordingly.
 .
 You can use the trait MouseX::Getopt::Meta::Attribute::Trait or the attribute
 metaclass MouseX::Getopt::Meta::Attribute to get non-default commandline
 option names and aliases.
 .
 You can use the trait MouseX::Getopt::Meta::Attribute::Trait::NoGetopt or the
 attribute metaclass MouseX::Getopt::Meta::Attribute::NoGetopt to have
 MouseX::Getopt ignore your attribute in the commandline options.

Description: extension for attribute interfaces for Mouse
 While Mouse attributes provide a way to name your accessors, readers,
 writers, clearers and predicates, MouseX::NativeTraits provides
 commonly used attribute helper methods for more specific types of data.
 .
 As seen in the "SYNOPSIS", you specify the data structure via the
 "traits" parameter. These traits will be loaded automatically, so you
 need not load MouseX::NativeTraits explicitly.
 .
 This extension is compatible with Moose native traits, although it is
 not a part of Mouse core.

Description: Mouse extension for making object constructors die on unknown attributes
 Simply loading MouseX::StrictConstructor in your Perl package will make
 your constructor "strict". If your constructor is called with an attribute
 argument that your class does not declare, then it dies. This is a great
 way to catch small typos.

Description: Path::Class type library for Mouse
 MouseX::Types::Path::Class creates common Mouse types, coercions and
 option specifications useful for dealing with Path::Class objects as
 Mouse attributes.
 .
 Coercions (see Mouse::Util::TypeConstraints) are made from both "Str"
 and "ArrayRef" to both Path::Class::Dir and Path::Class::File objects.
 If you have MouseX::Getopt installed, the Getopt option type ("=s") will
 be added for both Path::Class::Dir and Path::Class::File.

Description: Mouse extension to organise types in libraries
 MouseX::Types allows developers to organise and selectively import your own
 and the built-in types in libraries, rather than the default behaviour where
 types are global. As a nice side effect, it catches typographic errors at
 compile-time too.
 .
 The main motivation for this module is to provide an easy way of preventing
 conflicts with your type names, since the internal fully qualified names of
 the types will be prefixed with the library's name. It also provides some
 convenient functions for working with Mouse types.

 Mp3Splt-project is a utility to split mp3 and ogg files selecting a
 begin and an end time position, without decoding. It's very useful to
 split large mp3/ogg to make smaller files or to split entire albums to
 obtain original tracks. If you want to split an album, you can select
 split points and filenames manually or you can get them automatically
 from CDDB (internet or a local file) or from .cue files. Supports also
 automatic silence split, that can be used also to adjust cddb/cue
 splitpoints. You can extract tracks from Mp3Wrap or AlbumWrap files in
 few seconds. For mp3 files, both ID3v1 & ID3v2 tags are
 supported. Mp3splt-project is split in 3 parts: libmp3splt, mp3splt
 and mp3splt-gtk.
 .
 This package contains the files needed to build programs against
 libmp3splt.

Description: MP3 plugin for mp3splt
 Mp3Splt-project is a utility to split mp3 and ogg files selecting a
 begin and an end time position, without decoding. It's very useful to
 split large mp3/ogg to make smaller files or to split entire albums to
 obtain original tracks. If you want to split an album, you can select
 split points and filenames manually or you can get them automatically
 from CDDB (internet or a local file) or from .cue files. Supports also
 automatic silence split, that can be used also to adjust cddb/cue
 splitpoints. You can extract tracks from Mp3Wrap or AlbumWrap files in

Description: MPEG1 and MPEG2 video decoder library
 libmpeg2 is a library which can decode MPEG1 and MPEG2 video streams.
 .
 The main features in libmpeg2 are:
 .
  * Conformance - libmpeg2 is able to decode all mpeg streams that conform to
    certain restrictions. For streams that follow these restrictions, libmpeg2
    is probably 100% conformant to the mpeg standards - and there's a pretty
    extensive test suite to check this.
 .
  * Speed - there has been huge efforts there, and libmpeg2 is probably the
    fastest library around for what it does.
 .
  * Portability - most of the code is written in C, and when platform-specific
    optimizations are used, there always is a generic C routine to fall back
    on.  This should be portable to all architectures - at least it is known
    people run this code on x86, ppc, sparc, arm and sh4.
 .
  * Reuseability - libmpeg2 is not intended to include any project-specific
    code, but it should still include enough features to be used by very
    diverse projects.
 .
 This package contains the libmpeg2 shared libraries.

Description: multiple precision floating-point interval computation library
 This package provides a C library of functions for interval arithmetic
 computations with arbitrary precision.
 .
 The basic principle of interval arithmetic consists in enclosing every number
 by an interval containing it and being representable by machine numbers: for
 instance it can be stored as its lower and upper endpoints and these bounds
 are machine numbers, or as a centre and a radius which are machine numbers.
 .
 The arithmetic operations are extended for interval operands in such a way
 that the exact result of the operation belongs to the computed interval.
 .
 The purpose of an arbitrary precision interval arithmetic is on the one hand
 to get guaranteed results, thanks to interval computation, and on the other
 hand to obtain accurate results, thanks to multiple precision arithmetic. The
 MPFI library is built upon MPFR in order to benefit from the correct roundings
 provided by MPFR. Further advantages of using MPFR are its portability and
 compliance with the IEEE 754 standard for floating-point arithmetic.

Description: Debugging symbols for MPIKmeans
 This library uses an algorithm that yields the very same solution as standard
 k-means, even after each iteration. However, it uses triangle inequalities, and
 is much faster.
 .
 Note: MPI here does not refer to the Message Passing Interface; rather, it is
 an acronym for Max Planck Institute, where this algorithm was developed.
 .
 This package contains the debugging symbols.

Description: Implements MapReduce operation on top of standard MPI message - development
 The MapReduce-MPI (MR-MPI) library is open-source software that implements the
 MapReduce operation popularized by Google on top of standard MPI message
 passing.
 .
 The MR-MPI library is written in C++ and is callable from hi-level langauges
 such as C++, C, Fortran. A Python wrapper is also included, so MapReduce
 programs can be written in Python, including map() and reduce() user callback
 methods. A hi-level scripting interface to the MR-MPI library, called OINK, is
 also included which can be used to develop and chain MapReduce algorithms
 together in scripts with commands that simplify data management tasks. OINK has
 its own manual and doc pages.
 .
 This package contains development files needed to build MapReduce-MPI
 applications.

Description: module for writing MsWord documents in HTML format
 MsOffice::Word::HTML-Writer is one way to programatically generate documents
 targeted for Microsoft Word (MsWord).
 .
 MsWord can read documents encoded in native binary format, in Rich Text
 Format (RTF), in WordML (an XML dialect), or -- maybe this is less known --
 in HTML, with some special markup for pagination and other MsWord-specific
 features. Such HTML documents are often in several parts, because attachments
 like images or headers/footers need to be in separate files; however, since
 it is more convenient to carry all data in a single file, MsWord also
 supports the "MHTML" format (or "MHT" for short), i.e. an encapsulation of a
 whole HTML tree into a single file encoded in MIME multipart format. This
 format can be generated interactively from MsWord by calling the "SaveAs"
 menu and choosing the .mht extension.
 .
 MsOffice::Word::HTML::Writer helps you to programatically generate MsWord
 documents in MHT format. The advantage of this technique is that one can rely
 on standard HTML mechanisms for layout control, such as styles, tables, divs,
 etc -- of course this markup can be produced using your favorite HTML module.
 The added value of MsOffice::Word::HTML::Writer is to help building the MIME
 multipart file, and provide some abstractions for representing
 MsWord-specific features (headers, footers, fields, etc.). This is probably
 the most convenient way for programmatic document generation.
