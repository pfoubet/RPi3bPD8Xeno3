 This provides a simple object for Pure Data that reports the size of an array
 by name. For historical reasons, it is packaged as a standalone object.  It
 is a very simple object, but has always been distributed by itself.  It is
 packaged alone in keeping with the one-library-per-package style of all other
 pd libraries.
 .
 This is a tiny package that might otherwise be lumped into a 'goodies'
 package, but it is the only tiny like this, so a 'goodies' package would end
 up being just this single object anyway.

Description: a Pd library for the "boids" flocking simulator algorithm
 Boids is a bird flight and animal flock simulator. It is based on the
 same algorithm which was used in Jurassic Park for the herding
 dinosaurs.  Boids takes an integer argument which is the number of
 boids. Each time Boids receives a bang, it calculates and outputs the
 new positions of the boids. The output consists of thew coordiantes
 for each boid, the number and type depending on the mode.
 .
 The flight parameters can be changed with messages. Use the 'dump'
 message to output a list of the current parameter settings.
 .

Description: Pd library of clones of Max/MSP 4.5 objects
 Cyclone is a library of PureData classes, bringing some level of
 compatibility between Max/MSP and Pd environments.  Although being
 itself in the early stage of development, it is meant to eventually
 become part of a much larger project, aiming at unification and
 standardization of computer musician's tools.
 .
 In its current form, cyclone is mainly for people using both Max and
 Pd, and thus wanting to develop cross-platform patches.  In this
 respect, cyclone has much in common with Thomas Grill's flext, and
 flext-based externals.  While flext enables developing new
 cross-platform classes, cyclone makes existing classes cross-platform.
 .
 Cyclone also comes handy, somewhat, in the task of importing Max/MSP
 patches into Pd.  Do not expect miracles, though, it is usually not an
 easy task.

 FFTease 2.5 objects will reconfigure themselves in response to changes in FFT
 size or signal vector size. Therefore, they may now be used in MaxMSP poly~
 objects with downsampling or upsampling. Changes in vector size remain
 subject to limitations imposed by the current poly~ (and Pluggo)
 architecture.
 .
 Caveat: these objects are CPU intensive. A few of these objects in a patch
 could push your computer to its limits. Be very careful with playback volume
 as some of the objects produce dramatically different (lower or higher)
 overall levels.
 .
 Acknowledgements: This work draws heavily on the phase vocoder code presented
 by F. Richard Moore in his classic "Elements of Computer Music." Additional
 inspiration was derived from work on cross synthesis and noise reduction by
 Mark Dolson at CARL in the mid-1980s. We also wish to thank Miller Puckette
 and David Zicarelli for designing and implementing the framework under which
 FFTease is presented.

 The 'libdir' loader is a Pure Data loader which supports the libdir
 library format.  The libdir library format aims to be a common
 library format for Pd which works with objects written in any
 language, including Pd. This library format was designed to be easy
 to create, install, and use. It should work when installed into the
 global path (i.e. pd/extra) or when copied locally into a project
 folder. It should work with objects written in any supported language
 (i.e. binaries, .pd, and the various loaders like pdlua and tclpd).

Description: Pd library for analysing musical performance
 maxlib is a library of non-tilde externals for Pd. The objects can be very
 useful to analyse any musical performance. Some of the objects are 'borrowed'
 from Max (they are not ported but rewritten for Pd cheap immitations). maxlib
 has recently been extended by objects of more general use and some which can
 be use for composition purposes. It also includes some networking objects for
 writing Pd patches that act as network clients and servers.

Description: library of Pd objects related to GUI control
 Moonlib includes three sub-sections: nilib, which is a kind of wrapper
 between Pd and Gtk, sublib, which is a collection of gui control objects, and
 other, which are miscellaneous objects:
 .
  * tabenv: like env~, an enveloppe follower, but computing on a table,
            so possibly much speeder than real-time env~'s computation
  * tabsort, tabsort2: returns the indices of the sorted table,
                       tabsort2 is bidimentionnal
  * gamme: one octave of a piano keyboard used to filter/choose
           notes in a selected scale
  * absolutepath/relativepath: to use files (sounds, texts, presets,
                               images, programs...) nested in the patch's
                               directory (and in subdirs)
  * sarray and slist: to creates shared dynamic arrays or lists with symbols
  * sfread2~ and readsfv~: to pitch the direct-from-disk reading of sound files
  * dinlet~: an inlet~ with a default value (when nothing is connected to it)
  * mknob: a round knob ala iemgui vslider (with its "properties" window)
  * dispatch: creates one bus name for many buttons' buses: from the
              N pairs (slider1-snd/slider1-rcv) ... (sliderN-snd/sliderN-rcv),
              creates only one pair of buses named (slider-snd/slider-rcv),
              in which datas are prepended by the number of the "sub-bus"
  * joystik: an improvment of Joseph A. Sarlo's joystick
  * image: an improvment  of Guenter Geiger's one. Same name, but it's
           compatible. Here you can share images through different objects,
           preload a list of images, and animate this list.

 This library allows one to construct and parse OSC messages within Pd.  It
 includes support for ordinary OSC-messages, typetags, timetags and bundles.
 .
 These objects are transport-agnostic, so you can use them to transmit OSC over
 UDP, TCP/IP, serial port, or in fact whatever you want.  However, you will have
 to install additional libraries that will handle the transport layer (like
 pd-iemnet or pd-comport).

 sources that are as sharp as is possible with current loudspeaker
 configuration and amplitude panning methods, since it uses at one time the
 minimum number of loudspeakers needed, one, two, or three.
 .
 With 2-D setups VBAP is a reformulation of the existing pair-wise panning
 method. Different from other panning algorithms, VBAP can be generalized for
 3-D loudspeaker setups as a triplet-wise panning method. A sound signal is
 then applied to one, two, or three loudspeakers simultaneously. VBAP has
 certain advantages compared to earlier virtual source positioning methods in
 arbitrary layouts. Previous methods either used all loudspeakers to produce
 virtual sources, which results in some artefacts, or they used loudspeaker
 triplets with a non-generalizable 2-D user interface.
 .
 The directional qualities of virtual sources generated with VBAP can be
 stated as follows. Directional coordinates used for this purpose are the
 angle between a position vector and the median plane (θcc), and the angle
 between a projection of a position vector to the median plane and frontal
 direction (Φcc). The perceived θcc direction of a virtual source coincides
 well with the VBAP panning direction when a loudspeaker set is near the
 median plane. When the loudspeaker set is moved towards a side of a listener,
 the perceived θcc direction is biased towards the median plane. The perceived
 Φcc direction of an amplitude-panned virtual source is individual and cannot
 be predicted with any panning law.

Description: Preparation of protein structures for electrostatics calculations
 PDB2PQR is a Python software package that automates many of the common
 tasks of preparing structures for continuum electrostatics calculations.
 It thus provides a platform-independent utility for converting protein files
 in PDB format to PQR format. These tasks include:
  * Adding a limited number of missing heavy atoms to biomolecular structures
  * Determining side-chain pKas
  * Placing missing hydrogens
  * Optimizing the protein for favorable hydrogen bonding
  * Assigning charge and radius parameters from a variety of force fields
 .
 This package also includes PropKa, a tool to modify the protonation state of
 protein structures in the Protein Data Bank (PDB) format to match a given pKa
 value. It can also be used to refine NMR structures, which often yield
 inaccurate pKa values for some residues.

Description: scale and tile PDF images/pages to print on multiple pages
 Pdfposter can be used to create a large poster by building it from
 multiple pages and/or printing it on large media. It expects as input a
 PDF file, normally printing on a single page. The output is again a
 PDF file, maybe containing multiple pages together building the
 poster. The input page will be scaled to obtain the desired size.
 .
 This is much like poster does for Postscript files, but working with PDF.
 Since sometimes poster does not like your files converted from PDF. :-)
 Indeed pdfposter was inspired by poster.  For more information please refer
 to the manpage or visit the project homepage

Description: tool for extracting/scrubbing versioning data from PDF documents
 PDFResurrect is a tool for analyzing and manipulating revisions to
 PDF documents (sometimes known as Adobe Acrobat files). The PDF format
 allows for previous changes to be retained in a revised version of the
 document, thereby keeping a running history of revisions to the document.
 .
 This tool extracts all previous revisions while also producing a summary
 of changes between revisions. It can also "scrub" or write data over the
 original instances of PDF objects that have been modified or deleted, in
 an effort to disguise information from previous versions that might not
 be intended for anyone else to read.

 package exists to fulfil the needs of existing users, dependencies
 and build-dependencies by providing pdksh symlinks to the legacy
 flavour of mksh. You can safely remove it once you have no remaining
 users or scripts depending on pdksh any more (do make sure to check
 users' login shells).
 .
 Note: the mksh legacy flavour is not intended for interactive use.
 Please change your login shell to /bin/mksh and copy /etc/skel/.mkshrc
 to your home directory.

Description: perl data language: Perl extensions for numerics
 PDL gives standard perl the ability to COMPACTLY
 store and SPEEDILY manipulate the large N-dimensional data arrays
 which are the bread and butter of scientific computing.  The idea
 is to turn perl in to a free, array-oriented, numerical language
 in the same sense as commercial packages like IDL and MatLab. One
 can write simple perl expressions to manipulate entire numerical arrays
 all at once. For example, using PDL the perl variable $a can hold a
 1024x1024 floating point image, it only takes 4Mb of memory to store
 it and expressions like $a=sqrt($a)+2 would manipulate the whole image
 in a few seconds.
 .
 A simple interactive shell (perldl) is provided for command line use
 together with a module (PDL) for use in perl scripts.

Description: Efficient rsh-like utility, for using hosts in parallel
 Pdsh is a high-performance, parallel remote shell utility, similar to dsh.
 It has built-in, thread-safe clients for rsh. Pdsh uses a "sliding window"
 parallel algorithm to conserve socket resources on the initiating node and
 to allow progress to continue while timeouts occur on some connections.
 .
 It makes all parallel connections from one client machine, and attempts to
 keep 32 (default, can be changed on command line) connections to remote
 machines at any given time.  It can run single commands or as an interactive
 shell.

Description: five in a row game for X and the console
 Pente is the English name for the Asian game ni-nuki, which itself
 is a version of the game go-moku. The game is a variant of the well
 known five in a row. Placing five stones in a row is one way to win,
 the other is to capture five pairs of the opponents stones.
 .
 Pente can run in three different modes: X, curses or text. You can
 play against the computer or another human, and there is also support
 for playing over a network.

Description: clone of the strategy board game Blokus
 Pentobi is a strategy board game played on a square grid board using playing
 pieces in the shapes of polyominoes, similar to Tetris pieces.  The aim of the
 game is to place all of your pieces while trying to block your opponent from
 placing all of theirs.
 .
 The game ends when no one can place any more pieces and the winner is
 determined by calculating the score based on the points of any remaining
 playing pieces. Bonus points are added for playing every piece and additional
 bonus points are added if the monomino, the 1x1 square piece, is played last.

Description: DTrace-like tools for Linux
 A miscellaneous collection of in-development and unsupported
 performance analysis tools for Linux perf_events, aka the "perf"
 command, and ftrace. Both perf_events and ftrace are core Linux
 tracing tools, and are included in the Linux kernel source.
 .
 These tools are designed to be simple to use, easy to install, and
 provide advanced performance observability. This collection was
 written by Brendan Gregg (author of the DTraceToolkit).
 .
 Many of these tools employ workarounds so that functionality is
 possible on existing Linux kernels. Because of this, many tools have
 caveats (see man pages), and their implementation should be
 considered a placeholder until future kernel features, or new tracing
 subsystems, are added.

 by skipping them with lseek when writing a file and thus not allocating
 disk blocks. Unfortunately it does no longer. So here is program to make
 holes in existing files.
 .
 Also there are some scripts that help cleaning up the hard disk
 (finding duplicated and/or unstripped files).

Description: Larry Wall's Practical Extraction and Report Language
 Perl is a highly capable, feature-rich programming language with over
 20 years of development. Perl 5 runs on over 100 platforms from
 portables to mainframes. Perl is suitable for both rapid prototyping
 and large scale development projects.
 .
 Perl 5 supports many programming styles, including procedural,
 functional, and object-oriented. In addition to this, it is supported
 by an ever-growing collection of reusable modules which accelerate
 development. Some of these modules include Web frameworks, database
 integration, networking protocols, and encryption. Perl provides
 interfaces to C and C++ for custom extension development.

 configuration of that version of perl, to circumvent the use of
 compiled test binaries which will fail during a cross-build.
 .
 Also provides a helper script to push the relevant configuration
 files into the cross-build using support in debian/rules within
 perl.

 Note that this package is primarily of use in debugging *Perl* rather
 than perl programs, which may be traced/debugged using the standard
 perl binary using the -d switch (see perldebug(1)).

Description: rough indicator of Perl module dependencies
 perl-depends is a tool to show roughly what modules a program uses. Perl
 evaluates "use" commands at compile time, storing the information about
 loaded modules in the %INC variable. Comparing that list with the
 standard Perl modules gives an estimate of the external module
 dependencies.
 .
 The dependency information can be used to determine what external
 modules have to be installed before the program can be used.

Description: Perl module providing the Tk graphics library
 Perl/Tk (also known as pTk or ptk) is a collection of modules and
 code that attempts to wed the easily configured Tk widget toolkit
 to the powerful lexigraphic, dynamic memory, I/O, and object-oriented
 capabilities of Perl 5. In other words, it is an interpreted
 scripting language for making widgets and programs with Graphical
 User Interfaces (GUI).
 .
 A good place to get started is by running the "widget" demo that's
 installed with this package.

Description: Perl-based reverse proxy load balancer and web server
 Perlbal is a single-threaded event-based server supporting HTTP load
 balancing, web serving, and a mix of the two. Perlbal can act as either a web
 server or a reverse proxy.
 .
 One of the defining things about Perlbal is that almost everything can be
 configured or reconfigured on the fly without needing to restart the software.
 A basic configuration file containing a management port enables you to easily
 perform operations on a running instance of Perlbal.
 .
 Perlbal can also be extended by means of per-service (and global) plugins that
 can override many parts of request handling and behavior.

Description: script to manage perl installations in your $HOME
 perlbrew is a program to automate the building and installation of perl
 in the users HOME. At the moment, it installs everything to ~/perl5/perlbrew,
 and requires you to tweak your PATH by including a bashrc/cshrc file it
 provides, in your shell configuration file. You then can benefit from not
 having to run 'sudo' commands to install cpan modules because those are
 installed inside your HOME too. It's a completely separate perl environment.

 You can create your own applets to show and do whatever you need using
 Perl and the Gtk2 bindings for it. It's no problem to run several PerlPanels
 at the same time.

Description: Graphical design of primers for PCR
 PerlPrimer is a free, open-source GUI application written in Perl that designs
 primers for standard Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR), bisulphite PCR,
 real-time PCR (QPCR) and sequencing. It aims to automate and simplify the
 process of primer design.
 .
 If operated online, the tool nicely communicates with the Ensembl
 project for further insights into the gene structure, i.e., allowing
 for taking the location of exons and introns into account for the design
 of the primers.  The sequences themselves can be retrieved, too.

Description: Executing commands in parallel
 The main purpose of pexec is to execute the given command in parallel on
 the local host or on remote hosts, while some of the execution
 parameters, namely the redirected standard input, output or error and
 environmental variables can be varied. The capabilities of the program
 are extended with additional features, such as allowing to define mutual
 exclusions, do atomic command executions and implement higher level
 resource and job control. The maximum number of simultaneous tasks can
 be controlled by a hypervisor daemon: with such a daemon, concurrent
 pexec instances can be launched without an unexpectedly high load.

Description: PostgreSQL graphical client using Tcl/Tk
 Postgres Forms (pfm) is a client application with a graphical user
 interface for the PostgreSQL data base server. It enables the user:
 to design forms for adding, modifying or deleting records of data
 base tables;
 .
   - to design links (one to many relationships) from one form
     to another, for navigating in the data base;
 .
   - to design and to generate reports based on the data in a
     table or view;
 .
   - to edit and to execute SQL statements.
 .
 Postgres Forms is implemented in Tcl/Tk, but there is no need for the
 user to program anything in Tcl/Tk. The user only has to use SQL for
 creating tables and views and for designing forms, links and reports.
 .
 Postgres Forms makes no attempt to hide the underlying SQL. On the
 contrary, in most cases, it shows both the SQL statements it sends to
 the PostgreSQL server and the results it gets back.
 .
 The PostgreSQL server can be remote or local.

Description: set of tone mapping operators
 This package contains a set of state-of-the-art tone mapping operators. Tone
 mapping is a technique used to approximately map the appearance of
 high-dynamic range (HDR) images to media with more limited dynamic range. The
 operators are suitable for processing of both static images and animations.
 .
 The operators are embedded in a flexible framework (pfstools) which provides
 a unified input/output mechanism and a modular architecture for the filtering
 of the image data. Various file formats for static images and video are
 transparently supported and the High Dynamic Range data are processed
 modularly through a Unix piping mechanism.

Description: connection pool server and replication proxy for PostgreSQL
 pgpool-II is a middleware that works between PostgreSQL servers and a
 PostgreSQL database client. It provides the following features:
 .
  * Connection Pooling
  * Replication
  * Load Balance
  * Limiting Exceeding Connections
  * Parallel Query
 .
 pgpool-II talks PostgreSQL's backend and frontend protocol, and relays a
 connection between them. Therefore, a database application (frontend) thinks
 that pgpool-II is the actual PostgreSQL server, and the server (backend) sees
 pgpool-II as one of its clients. Because pgpool-II is transparent to both the
 server and the client, an existing database application can be used with
 pgpool-II almost without a change to its sources.
 .
 This is version 3 of pgpool-II, the second generation of pgpool.

Description: replay PostgreSQL log files
 Reads a PostgreSQL log file (*not* a WAL file), extracts the SQL statements and
 executes them in the same order and with the original timing against a
 PostgreSQL database.
 .
 If the execution of statements gets behind schedule, warning messages are
 issued that indicate that the server cannot handle the load in a timely
 fashion.
 .
 A final report gives you a useful statistical analysis of your workload and its
 execution.
 .
 The idea is to replay a real-world database workload as exactly as possible.
 .
 This is useful for performance tests, particularly in the following situations:
 - You want to compare the performance of your PostgreSQL application on
   different hardware or different operating systems.
 - You want to upgrade your database and want to make sure that the new database
   version does not suffer from performance regressions that affect you.

 PHing Is Not GNU make; it's a project build system based on Apache Ant.
 You can do anything with it that you could do with a traditional build system
 like GNU make, and its use of
 simple XML build files and extensible PHP "task" classes make it an
 easy-to-use and highly flexible build framework.
 Features include file transformations (e.g. token replacement, XSLT
 transformation, Smarty template transformations,
 etc.), file system operations, interactive build support, SQL execution, and
 much more.
 .
 Phing provides the following features:
  * Simple XML buildfiles
  * Rich set of provided tasks
  * Easily extendable via PHP classes

Description: Interface to digital still cameras
 This is a library and a command-line frontend to manipulate digital
 still cameras based on Fujitsu chipset and Sierra Imaging firmware.  The
 program is known to work with Agfa, Epson and Olympus cameras.  Should
 also work with Sanyo, but this is untested.
 .
 The cameras typically come with software for Windows and for Mac, and no
 description of the protocol.  With this tool, they are manageable from a
 UNIX box.  Bruce D. Lightner <lightner@metaflow.com> has added support
 for Win32 and DOS platforms.  Note that the program does not have any
 GUI, it is plain command-line even on Windows.  For a GUI, check out
 the phototk program.

Description: PHP micro logging package
 PHP 5.3+ micro logging class that can be extended via closures. Includes
 several pre-built handlers including file, mail, syslog, HTTP post, and
 MongoDB.
 .
 Analog also comes with over a dozen pre-written handlers in the
 Analog/Handlers folder, with examples for each in the examples folder.
 These include:
 .
  - Amon - Send logs to the Amon server monitoring tool
  - Buffer - Buffer messages to send all at once (works with File, Mail,
    Stderr,
    and Variable handlers)
  - ChromeLogger - Sends messages to Chrome Logger browser plugin
  - File - Append messages to a file
  - FirePHP - Send messages to FirePHP browser plugin
  - GELF - Send message to the Graylog2 log management server
  - LevelBuffer - Buffer messages and send only if sufficient error level
    reached
  - Mail - Send email notices
  - Mongo - Save to MongoDB collection
  - Multi - Send different log levels to different handlers
  - Null - Do nothing
  - Post - Send messages over HTTP POST to another machine
  - Stderr - Send messages to STDERR
  - Syslog - Send messages to syslog
  - Threshold - Only writes log messages above a certain threshold
  - Variable - Buffer messages to a variable reference.
 .
 So while it's a micro class, it's highly extensible and very capable out of the
 box too.

Description: PHP PEAR package for building Calendar data structures
 Calendar provides an API for building Calendar data structures. Using
 the simple iterator and it's "query" API, a user interface can easily be
 built on top of the calendar data structure, at the same time easily
 connecting it to some kind of underlying data store, where "event" information
 is being held.
 .
 It provides different calculation "engines" the default being based on
 Unix timestamps (offering fastest performance) with an alternative using
 PEAR::Date which extends the calendar past the limitations of Unix timestamps.
 Other engines should be implementable for other types of calendar (e.g. a
 Chinese Calendar based on lunar cycles).

Description: PHP PEAR Database Abstraction Layer
 DB is a database abstraction layer providing:
  * an OO-style query API
  * portability features that make programs written for one DBMS work
    with other DBMS's
  * a DSN (data source name) format for specifying database servers
  * prepare/execute (bind) emulation for databases that don't support it
    natively
  * a result object for each query response
  * portable error codes
  * sequence emulation
  * sequential and non-sequential row fetching as well as bulk fetching
  * formats fetched rows as associative arrays, ordered arrays or objects
  * row limit support
  * transactions support
  * table information interface
  * DocBook and phpDocumentor API documentation
 .
 DB layers itself on top of PHP's existing database extensions.
 .
 Drivers for the following extensions pass the complete test suite and
 provide interchangeability when all of the database's portability
 options are enabled:
  fbsql, ibase, informix, msql, mssql,
  mysql, mysqli, oci8, odbc, pgsql,
  sqlite and sybase.
 .
 There is also a driver for the dbase extension, but it can't be used
 interchangeably because dbase doesn't  support many standard DBMS
 features.

Description: Documentation for PHP5
 This package provides the documentation for the PHP scripting language.
 .
 PHP, which stands for "PHP: Hypertext Preprocessor" is a widely-used Open
 Source general-purpose scripting language that is especially suited for Web
 development and can be embedded into HTML. Its syntax draws upon C, Java, and
 Perl, and is easy to learn. The main goal of the language is to allow web
 developers to write dynamically generated web pages quickly, but you can do

Description: tool for object-relational mapping
 Object-Relational-Mapper for PHP.
 Doctrine 2 is an object-relational mapper (ORM) for PHP that provides
 transparent persistence for PHP objects. It sits on top of a powerful
 database abstraction layer (DBAL). One of its key features is the
 option to write database queries in a proprietary object oriented SQL
 dialect called Doctrine Query Language (DQL), inspired by Hibernates
 HQL. This provides developers with a powerful alternative to SQL that
 maintains flexibility without requiring unnecessary code duplication.

 The Event_Dispatcher acts as a notification dispatch table. It is used to
 notify other objects of interesting things. This information is encapsulated
 in Event_Notification objects. Client objects register themselves with the
 Event_Dispatcher as observers of specific notifications posted by other
 objects. When an event occurs, an object posts an appropriate notification to
 the Event_Dispatcher. The Event_Dispatcher dispatches a message to each
 registered observer, passing the notification as the sole argument.

Description: XSL wrapper and extension to XSLTProcessor
 An experimental XSL wrapper / extension to the PHP 5.x XSLTProcessor
 .
 The fXSL classes extend the standard XSLTProcessor to use exceptions at
 all occasions of errors instead of PHP warnings, notices, or semi
 completed transformations. They also add various custom methods and
 shortcuts for convenience and to allow a nicer API to implement
 callbacks to the PHP stack.

Description: read gettext MO files directly, without requiring anything other than PHP
 The GNU gettext library is a widely used localization library, but in
 order to use it with the PHP language, the system has to support the
 desired locale, and library itself must be installed.
 .
 Since this is not always the case, PHP-gettext has been developed to be
 able to read gettext MO files directly, without requiring anything other
 than PHP.
 .
 Currently, it's usable if you develop most of the infrastructure for
 choosing language on your own, because it's possible to use both
 gettext() and ngettext() calls. In the near future, it should also be
 fully compatible drop-in replacement for all of gettext functionality
 written in PHP.

Description: Integrated Templates
 HTML_Template_IT is a templating engine designed to allow easy separation
 of concerns. It does this by clearly separating the presentational code
 from the PHP code. The presentation code may be of any format, however
 generally XML or HTML is used.
 This engine works on the foundation of blocks and placeholders. It uses the
 hierarchy of blocks to determine which presentational code is instantiated
 when blocks are parsed. The placeholders allow the insertion of "dynamic"
 information.
 There are two classes to use for templating. HTML_Template_IT is used for
 basic templating needs.  HTML_Template_ITX gives you full power over the
 templating engine, allowing blocks to be added, and function callbacks to
 be used.

 .
 The main difference to most other DB abstraction packages is that MDB2 goes
 much further to ensure portability. MDB2 provides most of its many features
 optionally that can be used to construct portable SQL statements:
  * Object-Oriented API
  * A DSN (data source name) or array format for specifying database servers
  * Datatype abstraction and on demand datatype conversion
  * Various optional fetch modes to fix portability issues
  * Portable error codes
  * Sequential and non sequential row fetching as well as bulk fetching
  * Ability to make buffered and unbuffered queries
  * Ordered array and associative array for the fetched rows
  * Prepare/execute (bind) named and unnamed placeholder emulation
  * Sequence/autoincrement emulation
  * Replace emulation
  * Limited sub select emulation
  * Row limit emulation
  * Transactions/savepoint support
  * Large Object support
  * Index/Unique Key/Primary Key support
  * Pattern matching abstraction
  * Module framework to load advanced functionality on demand
  * Ability to read the information schema
  * RDBMS management methods (creating, dropping, altering)
  * Reverse engineering schemas from an existing database
  * SQL function call abstraction
  * Full integration into the PEAR Framework
  * PHPDoc API documentation

Description: PHP Pear module for NNTP
 PEAR's package for communication with NNTP/Usenet servers.
 Net_NNTP handles the connection and protocol level commands (RFC977),
 including many commonly implemented non-standard commands (RFC2980).
 Net_NNTP includes an unserfriendly API for intermediate user, who don't
 want to work directly at the command level. However, Net_NNTP does require
 some knowlege about the NNTP protocol (RFC 977), and general knowledge
 about email (RFC(2)822) and MIME (2045-2048), since any handling of both
 content and headers is left up to the user!
 The protocol implementation does not parse the actual article data, but at
 the command level it splits returned data at protocol specified boundaries
 where appropriate.

Description: UTF-8 strings handling for PHP
 Patchwork UTF-8 provides both a portability layer for mbstring, iconv, and
 intl Normalizer and grapheme_* functions, and an UTF-8 grapheme clusters
 aware replica of native string functions.
 .
 Patchwork UTF-8 provides pure PHP implementations for mbstring, iconv, and
 intl. The following set of portability-fallbacks allows an application to run
 on a server even if one or more of those extensions are not enabled:
 .
  * utf8_encode, utf8_decode,
  * mbstring: mb_check_encoding, mb_convert_case, mb_convert_encoding,
    mb_decode_mimeheader, mb_detect_encoding, mb_detect_order,
    mb_encode_mimeheader, mb_encoding_aliases, mb_internal_encoding,
    mb_language, mb_list_encodings, mb_strlen, mb_strpos, mb_strrpos,
    mb_strtolower, mb_strtoupper, mb_stripos, mb_stristr, mb_strrchr,
    mb_strrichr, mb_strripos, mb_strstr, mb_substitute_character, mb_substr,
  * iconv: iconv, iconv_mime_decode, iconv_mime_decode_headers,
    iconv_get_encoding, iconv_set_encoding, iconv_mime_encode,
    ob_iconv_handler, iconv_strlen, iconv_strpos, iconv_strrpos, iconv_substr,
  * intl: Normalizer, grapheme_extract, grapheme_stripos, grapheme_stristr,
    grapheme_strlen, grapheme_strpos, grapheme_strripos, grapheme_strrpos,
    grapheme_strstr, grapheme_substr.
 .
 The Patchwork\Utf8 class implements the quasi-complete set of native string
 functions that need UTF-8 grapheme clusters awareness. Function names,
 arguments and behavior carefully replicates native PHP string functions.
 .
 Some more functions are also provided to help handling UTF-8 strings:
  * filter(): normalizes to UTF-8 NFC, converting from CP-1252 when needed,
  * isUtf8(): checks if a string contains well formed UTF-8 data,
  * toAscii(): generic UTF-8 to ASCII transliteration,
  * strtocasefold(): unicode transformation for caseless matching,
  * strtonatfold(): generic case sensitive transformation for collation
    matching
 .
 Mirrored string functions are: strlen, substr, strpos, stripos, strrpos,
 strripos, strstr, stristr, strrchr, strrichr, strtolower, strtoupper,
 wordwrap, chr, count_chars, ltrim, ord, rtrim, trim, str_ireplace, str_pad,
 str_shuffle, str_split, str_word_count, strcmp, strnatcmp, strcasecmp,
 strnatcasecmp, strncasecmp, strncmp, strcspn, strpbrk, strrev, strspn, strtr,
 substr_compare, substr_count, substr_replace, ucfirst, lcfirst, ucwords,
 number_format, utf8_encode, utf8_decode, json_decode,
 filter_input, filter_input_array.

Description: common interface for logging libraries
 The main goal is to allow libraries to receive a Psr\Log\LoggerInterface object
 and write logs to it in a simple and universal way. Frameworks and CMSs that
 have custom needs MAY extend the interface for their own purpose, but SHOULD
 remain compatible with this document. This ensures that the third-party
 libraries an application uses can write to the centralized application logs.
 .
 The LoggerInterface exposes eight methods to write logs to the eight RFC 5424
 levels (debug, info, notice, warning, error, critical, alert, emergency).
 .
 A ninth method, log, accepts a log level as first argument. Calling this method
 with one of the log level constants MUST have the same result as calling the
 level-specific method. Calling this method with a level not defined by this
 specification MUST throw a Psr\Log\InvalidArgumentException if the
 implementation does not know about the level. Users SHOULD NOT use a custom
 level without knowing for sure the current implementation supports it.
 .
 Note that this is not a logger of its own. It is merely an interface that
 describes a logger. See the specification for more details.

Description: PHP implementaion of json_encode/decode
 JSON (JavaScript Object Notation, http://json.org) is a lightweight
 data-interchange format. It is easy for humans to read and write. It is easy
 for machines to parse and generate. It is based on a subset of the JavaScript
 Programming Language, Standard ECMA-262 3rd Edition - December 1999. This
 feature can also be found in Python. JSON is a text format that is completely
 language independent but uses conventions that are familiar to programmers of
 the C-family of languages, including C, C++, C#, Java, JavaScript, Perl, Tcl,
 and many others. These properties make JSON an ideal data-interchange
 language.
 This package provides a simple encoder and decoder for JSON notation. It is
 intended for use with client-side Javascript applications that make use of
 HTTPRequest to perform server communication functions - data can be encoded
 into JSON notation for use in a client-side javascript, or decoded from
 incoming Javascript requests. JSON format is native to Javascript, and can be
 directly eval()'ed with no further parsing overhead.

 in real-time. It is especially handy for dealing with long running
 sub-processes due to its feature to run them asynchronously, while
 still providing access to their full and incremental output. It
 additionally supports signals, provides the PID of a sub-process
 and allows the definition of process timeouts.

Description: transform Wiki and BBCode markup into XHTML, LaTeX or plain text markup
 The text transformation is done in 2 steps.
 The chosen parser uses markup rules to tokenize the tags and content.
 Renderers output the tokens and text into the requested format.
 The tokenized form replaces the tags by a protected byte value associated
 to an index in an options table. This form shares up to 50 rules by all
 parsers and renderers.
 The package is intented for versatile transformers as well as converters.
 Text_Wiki is delivered with its own parser, which is used by Yawiki or
 Horde's Wicked and three basic renderers: XHTML , LaTeX and plain text.
 Strong sanitizing of XHTML is default.
 Parsers (* and Renderers) exist for BBCode, Cowiki (*), Dokuwiki (*),
 Mediawiki and Tikiwiki (*).
 It is highly configurable and can be easily extended.

Description: SAX parser for HTML and other badly formed XML documents
 php-xml-htmlsax3 provides an API very similar to the native
 PHP XML extension (http://www.php.net/xml), allowing handlers
 using one to be easily adapted to the other.
 .
 The key difference is php-xml-htmlsax3 will not break
 on badly formed XML, allowing it to be used for parsing
 HTML documents.

Description: XML parsing class based on PHP's bundled expat
 This is an XML parser based on PHPs built-in xml extension.
 It supports two basic modes of operation: "func" and "event".  In "func" mode,
 it will look for a function named after each element (xmltag_ELEMENT for start
 tags and xmltag_ELEMENT_ for end tags), and in "event" mode it uses a set of
 generic callbacks.
 .
 Since version 1.2.0 there's a new XML_Parser_Simple class that makes parsing
 of most XML documents easier, by automatically providing a stack for the
 elements.
 Furthermore its now possible to split the parser from the handler object, so
 you do not have to extend XML_Parser anymore in order to parse a document with
 it.

 XML_Serializer creates XML files from data structures and vice versa.
 It serializes complex data structures like arrays or objects as XML
 documents. You can create any XML document without the need for DOM
 access.
 This package includes an unserializer facility that creates PHP data
 structures (like arrays and objects) from XML documents, if type hints
 are available. If not, it will try to guess how it has to be
 unserialized, doing exactly what you expect it to do in most cases.
 .
 Since version 0.8.0 the package is able to treat XML documents similar
 to the simplexml extension of PHP 5.

 primary solution to opcode caching in future versions of PHP.
 .
 The APCu is a fast solution for userland caching (and dumping) of PHP
 variables locally, it is not distributed like MemcacheD, but they can
 be used together for optimal caching.

Description: solr module for PHP 5
 PHP extension for communicating with Apache Solr server
 .
 It effectively simplifies the process of interacting with Apache Solr using
 PHP5 and it already comes with built-in readiness for the latest features
 added in Solr 3.1. The extension has features such as built-in,
 serializable query string builder objects which effectively simplifies the
 manipulation of name-value pair request parameters across repeated
 requests. The response from the Solr server is also automatically parsed
 into native php objects whose properties can be accessed as array keys or
 object properties without any additional configuration on the client-side.
 Its advanced HTTP client reuses the same connection across multiple
 requests and provides built-in support for connecting to Solr servers
 secured behind HTTP Authentication or HTTP proxy servers. It is also able
 to connect to SSL-enabled containers. Please consult the documentation for
 more details on features. Included in the source code are phpdoc stubs that
 enable autocomplete of Solr classes and methods in IDE during development
 in userland.

Description: Fast, stable PHP opcode cacher
 XCache is a fast, stable PHP opcode cacher that has been tested and
 is now running on production servers under high load.  It overcomes a
 lot of problems that has been with other competing opcachers such as
 being able to be used with new PHP versions.
 .
 PHP5 is an HTML-embedded scripting language. Much of its syntax is borrowed
 from C, Java and Perl with a couple of unique PHP-specific features thrown
 in. The goal of the language is to allow web developers to write

Description: XML-based report generator for PHP
 A common business need is the ability to generate reports dynamically from
 an SQL database and present the information in a tabular fashion.
 PHPReports takes an XML definition of the general layout of the report and a
 query, and produces a finished report in one of several formats.
 .
 PHPReports is both a useful report generation package, as well as an
 excellent demonstration of the power of XML/XSLT.

Description: Unit testing suite for PHP5
 Unit testing allows you to write small test methods which verify units of
 functionality in your program.  It is a powerful technique for improving the
 quality of your software, preventing regressions, and allowing confident
 refactoring of your code.
 .
 PHPUnit is a unit testing suite for the PHP language, modelled on the xUnit
 testing framework, designed by Kent Beck and Erich Gamma.  If you've used
 JUnit (for Java), PyUnit (for Python), CxxUnit (for C++), or any of the
 other equivalents for other languages, the API for this package should seem
 fairly familiar.  If you've never written unit tests before, the PHPUnit
 API is simple to learn and use.

Description: Phylogenetic estimation using Maximum Likelihood
 PhyML is a software that estimates maximum likelihood phylogenies from
 alignments of nucleotide or amino acid sequences. It provides a wide
 range of options that were designed to facilitate standard phylogenetic
 analyses. The main strengths of PhyML lies in the large number of
 substitution models coupled to various options to search the space of
 phylogenetic tree topologies, going from very fast and efficient methods
 to slower but generally more accurate approaches. It also implements
 two methods to evaluate branch supports in a sound statistical framework
 (the non-parametric bootstrap and the approximate likelihood ratio test).
 .
 PhyML was designed to process moderate to large data sets. In theory,
 alignments with up to 4,000 sequences 2,000,000 character-long can
 be analyzed. In  practice however, the amount of memory required to process
 a data set is proportional of the product of the number of sequences by their
 length. Hence, a large number of sequences can only be processed provided
 that they are short. Also, PhyML can handle long sequences provided that
 they are not numerous. With most standard personal computers, the “comfort
 zone” for PhyML generally lies around 3 to 500 sequences less than 2,000
 character long.
 .
 This pakcage also includes PhyTime.

Description: Compute Archimedes' constant Pi to arbitrary precision
 This program computes Archimedes' constant Pi to arbitrary precision.
 It is extremely fast and the precision is only limited by your machine's
 main memory.
 .
 This is a teaser for the CLN library, to which the actual computation is
 delegated.  You may use these decimal digits as random digits or search
 them for hidden messages.  :-)

Description: learn the piano just by playing a game
 Piano Booster is a new way to learn the piano just by playing a game.
 It takes elements of the game Guitar Hero but now it uses a real piano
 keyboard and the game has been turned sideways so the notes scroll along
 a musical stave. So instead of pressing buttons on a fake guitar you end
 up learning to play a real musical instrument: the piano.
 .
 To run Piano Booster you need a MIDI Piano Keyboard and a MIDI interface
 for the PC. If you don't have a MIDI keyboard you can still try out
 PianoBooster, using the PC keyboard ('x' is middle C), but a MIDI piano
 is really recommended).

 terminal window before / after dialing" feature). It could also prove
 useful in many other similar tasks. It is ideal for embedded systems
 since its memory footprint is minimal.

Description: Lisp interpreter and application server framework
 Pico Lisp can be viewed from two different aspects: As a general
 purpose programming language, and a dedicated application server
 framework.
 .
 As a programming language, Pico Lisp provides a 1-to-1 mapping of a
 clean and powerful Lisp derivate, to a simple and efficient virtual
 machine. It supports persistent objects as a first class data type,
 resulting in a database system of Entity/Relation classes and a
 Prolog-like query language tightly integrated into the system.
 .
 As an application server framework, Pico Lisp provides for database
 management (including multi-user synchronization, DB garbage collection
 journalling and replication), web interface integrated (and generated
 from) the application data model, and an application server.

Description: SAT solver with proof and core support
 Despite the NP completeness of the satisfiabilty problem of Boolean formulas
 (SAT), SAT solvers are often able to decide this problem in a reasonable time
 frame. As all other NP complete problems are reducible to SAT, the solvers
 have become a general purpose tool for this class of problems.

 PicoSAT is a SAT solver that turned out to be faster on industrial instances
 than MiniSAT 2.0 and also can generate proofs and cores in memory.

Description: Python Integrated Development Application, a Python IDE
 PIDA is the Python Integrated Development Application.
 It is an IDE (integrated development environment) written
 in Python (http://www.python.org/) and the GTK+
 (http://www.pygtk.org/) graphical toolkit.
 .
 Pida is an IDE, but one that is slightly different from
 other IDEs. Rather than attempting to write a set of
 development tools  of its own, Pida uses tools that the
 developer has available. In this regards Pida can be used as
 a framework for putting together your own bespoke IDE.
 .
 Although still a young application, Pida can already boast
 a huge number of features because of the power of some of
 the tools it integrates. For example features such as code completion
 and syntax highlighting are well implemented in Pida's integrated editors
 far better than any editor built for a commercial IDE. Pida currently features:
 Full code editing (syntax highlighting, code completion, automatic indenting,
 block commenting etc) Project management, version control management,
 Python debugger and profiler, GTK+ graphical user interface building and
 rapid application design, Pastebin integration.

Description: Colored adb logcat that shows entries for specific apps
 An update to Jeff Sharkey's excellent logcat color script which only shows
 log entries for processes from a specific application package.
 .
 During application development you often want to only display log messages
 coming from your app. Unfortunately, because the process ID changes every
 time you deploy to the phone it becomes a challenge to grep for the right
 thing.
 .
 This script solves that problem by filtering by application package. Supply
 the target package as the sole argument to the python script and enjoy a more
 convenient development process.

Description: Off-the-Record Messaging plugin for Pidgin
 OTR allows you to have private conversations over IM by providing:
  - Encryption
    - No one else can read your instant messages.
  - Authentication
    - You are assured the correspondent is who you think it is.
  - Deniability
    - The messages you send do _not_ have digital signatures that are
      checkable by a third party.  Anyone can forge messages after a
      conversation to make them look like they came from you.  However,
      _during_ a conversation, your correspondent is assured the messages
      they see are authentic and unmodified.
  - Perfect forward secrecy
    - If you lose control of your private keys, no previous conversation
      is compromised.
 .
 This is a Pidgin plugin which implements Off-the-Record (OTR) Messaging.

Description: realtime statistics server for PHP using MySQL as a read-only interface
 Pinba is a MySQL storage engine that acts as a realtime
 monitoring/statistics server for PHP using MySQL as a read-only
 interface.
 .
 It accumulates and processes data sent over UDP by multiple PHP
 processes and displays statistics in a nice human-readable form of
 simple "reports", also providing read-only interface to the raw data
 in order to make possible generation of more sophisticated reports and
 stats.
 .
 Even though Pinba was written with PHP in mind, any kind of client can
 create and send a Pinba packet to the server.

Description: curses-based PIN or pass-phrase entry dialog for GnuPG
 This package contains a program that allows for secure entry of PINs or
 pass phrases.  That means it tries to take care that the entered
 information is not swapped to disk or temporarily stored anywhere.
 This functionality is particularly useful for entering pass phrases
 when using encryption software such as GnuPG or e-mail clients using
 the same.  It uses an open protocol and is therefore not tied to
 particular software.
 .
 The program contained in this package implements a PIN entry dialog
 using the curses tool kit, meaning that it is useful for users working
 in text mode without the X Window System.  There are sibling packages
 that implement PIN entry dialogs that use an X tool kit.  If you
 install any of the latter packages then this package is not necessary
 because the sibling packages automatically fall back to text mode if
 X is not active.

 this. The goal is to connect different pipe segments to let the water flow
 from the inlet and through as many pipes as possible, until it finally
 reaches the outlet. This requires an even combination of speed, skill and

Description: non-linear audio/video editor using GStreamer
 GStreamer is a streaming media framework, based on graphs of filters
 which operate on media data.  Applications using this library can do
 anything from real-time sound processing to playing videos, and just
 about anything else media-related.  Its plugin-based architecture means
 that new data types or processing capabilities can be added simply by
 installing new plug-ins.
 .
 PiTiVi allows users to easily edit audio/video projects based on the
 GStreamer framework.  PiTIVi provides several ways of creating and
 modifying a timeline.  Ranging from a simple synopsis view (a-la
 iMovie) to the full-blown editing view (aka Complex View) which puts
 you in complete control of your editing.

Description: .deb package installation, upgrading, and removal testing tool
 piuparts tests that .deb packages (as used by Debian) handle
 installation, upgrading, and removal correctly. It does this by
 creating a minimal Debian installation in a chroot, and installing,
 upgrading, and removing packages in that environment, and comparing the
 state of the directory tree before and after. piuparts reports any
 files that have been added, removed, or modified during this process.
 .
 piuparts is meant as a quality assurance tool for people who create .deb
 packages to test them before they upload them to the Debian package archive.

Description: Create an image consisting of many small images
 Pixelize is a program that will use many scaled down images to
 try to duplicate, as closely as possible, another image.
 .
 Pixelize works by splitting up the image you want rendered (or
 duplicated) into a grid of small rectangular areas. Each area
 is analyzed, and replaced with an image chosen from a large
 database of images. Pixelize tries to pick images that best
 match each area.

Description: various packaging tools and scripts for KDE Applications
 This package contains a variety of packaging tools and build scripts that may
 be very useful when packaging KDE applications. Even if you are a maintainer
 of a very small KDE application, this package should be worthwhile checking
 out.
 .
 Main highlights:
  - recommended build flags for building packages based on the KDE Platform;
  - cdbs class for building packages based on the KDE Platform (kde.mk);
  - debhelper build system (--buildsystem=kde) and dh addon (--with kde) for
    building packages based on the KDE Platform;
  - dh_sameversiondep for generating a dependency that is versioned the same
    way as a dependency (coming from the same source) of another reference
    package.
  - dh_movelibkdeinit for moving libkdeinit4_*.so libraries to private
    location;
  - dh_sodeps (and sodeps dh addon) for generating so:Depends substvar for -dev
    packages based to which local packages lib*.so symlinks point to;
  - pkgkde-symbolshelper tool for efficient management of C and C++ symbol
    files;
  - pkgkde-debs2symbols tool for generating symbol files and symbol file
    patches from pre-built binaries in the deb packages;
  - pkgkde-getbuildlogs tool for downloading build logs for the specified
    package (from buildd.debian.org);
  - pkgkde-override-sc-dev-latest tool for overriding Breaks of the
    kde-sc-dev-latest package;
  - pkgkde-vcs tool for performing common tasks when packaging under VCS.
 .
 NOTE: since this package is cumulative, it does not depend on the packages it
 provides helpers for. I.e. you still need to explicitly build depend on
 debhelper or cdbs in your packages.

Description: toolkit for software and hardware integration testing
 PlainBox is a toolkit consisting of python3 library, development tools,
 documentation and examples. It is targeted at developers working on testing or
 certification applications and authors creating tests for such applications.
 .
 PlainBox can be used to both create simple and comprehensive test tools as
 well as to develop and execute test jobs and test scenarios. It was created as
 a refined and rewritten core of the Checkbox project. It has a well tested and
 documented core, small but active development community and a collection of
 associated projects that use it as a lower-level engine/back-end library.
 .
 PlainBox has a novel approach to discovering (and probing) hardware and
 software that is extensible and not hardwired into the system. It allows test
 developers to express association between a particular test and the hardware,
 software and configuration constraints that must be met for the test to
 execute meaningfully. This feature, along with pluggable test definitions,
 makes plainbox flexible and applicable to many diverse testing situations,
 ranging from mobile phones, traditional desktop computers, servers and up to
 testing "cloud" installations.

 A variety of filters are available to pick just the music you want
 to hear. In order to actually play the music it finds, Plait
 automatically hands off a play list to one of the supported
 music players (or you can use it manually with any player that
 supports .m3u playlists).

Description: Customizable Weather Plasmoid (CWP)
 This is another weather plasmoid.
 .
 It aims to be highly customizable, but a little harder to setup than other
 weather plasmoids. Nearly any weather forecast provider can be used,
 as long as the data is provided as html files (no flash).
 .
 The information how to extract the information from these html files is

Description: Yet Another Weather Plasmoid fetches weather forecasts for you
 yaWP is a nice and simple plasmoid for KDE 4.x to show the weather forecast,
 works with different weather sources, you can configure it to show several
 days in advance, to display the current satellite image and it is also
 possible to keep track of multiple cities.
 .
 This package contains the Plasmoid itself and the basic theme for yaWP.
 .
 yaWP can be considered to be the native KDE 4.x replacement for the
 SuperKaramba script "LiquidWeather++".

Description: medical image reconstruction and registration
 Plastimatch is an open source software for deformable
 image registration. It is designed for high-performance
 volumetric registration of medical images, such as X-ray
 computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging
 (MRI), and positron emission tomography (PET). Software
 features include:
    * B-spline method for deformable image registration
      (GPU and multicore accelerated), including support for
      image masking, landmark penalties, and regularization
    * Demons method for deformable image registration
      (GPU accelerated)
    * Multi-atlas segmentation
    * ITK-based algorithms for translation, rigid, affine,
      multiple demons methods, and B-spline registration
    * Pipelined, multi-stage registration framework with
      seamless conversion between most algorithms and
      transform types
    * Landmark-based deformable registration using thin-
      plate splines for global registration
    * Landmark-based deformable registration using radial
      basis functions for local corrections
    * Broad support for 3D image file formats (using ITK),
      including DICOM, Nifti, NRRD, MetaImage, and Analyze
    * Extensive toolchain for radiotherapy research, including
      support for DICOM, DICOM-RT, DICOM SRO, XiO file format,
      gamma analysis, contour manipulation, contour overlap
      analysis, and vector field analysis
 Plastimatch also features two handy utilities which are
 not directly related to image registration:
    * FDK cone-beam CT reconstruction (GPU and multicore
      accelerated)
    * Digitally reconstructed radiograph (DRR) generation
      (GPU and multicore accelerated)

 4 PM or so, Plee wakes up, tired. He has dreamed again about that awesome
 period when he went across the entire world together with his belle. He puts
 his leg in the honey pot... empty! Moreover every single honey pot in the
 house is empty. "One more trick of that kid", he thinks. "I'm going to give
 him such a wallop of which he sure will remember".
 .
 Following honey drops on the ground, Plee reaches the edge of the forest.
 Beginning of the game.

Description: Programming exerciser in Java, Python and others
 The Programmer's Learning Machine (PLM) is a free cross-platform programming
 exerciser. It lets you explore various concepts of programming through
 over 160 interactive exercises, that you can solve in either Java or
 Python.
 .
 The PLM interface and content is thoughtfully translated to English
 and French; we hope that other translations will be contributed in
 the future.
 .
 The following concepts are included in this package:
 .
  - Welcome: teach basics of programming to absolute beginners
  - Maze: classical maze escaping algorithms for intermediate
  - Sort: classical sorting algorithms for intermediate. One
    introduction lesson presents the basics of the sorting algorithms
    while two additional lessons apply them in more recreative settings.
  - Recursion: classical logo algorithms for intermediate
  - Turtle Art: explore a few classical LOGO figures
  - LightBot: little programmer's brain teaser for intermediate and advanced
 .
 Other lessons are planned to explore new concepts, such as the
 backtracking, dynamic programming, object-oriented programming or the
 standard libraries of python and Java. Other programming languages
 (such as Ruby or JavaScript) may be added in the future.
 .
 The Scala language was cut of the package because the Debian version
 of that language is too ancient for the PLM.

Description: script driven business graphics package
 Ploticus is script-driven, which makes it suitable for automated,
 unattended uses, or for applications that will be run again and again.
 In general, ploticus is good at making graphs like you would see in
 newspapers and news magazines, business publications, journals for
 medical and social sciences, and so on.
 .
 Ploticus is not a function or mathematical plotting package like
 gnuplot, nor would it be a good choice for applications where
 mathematical formulas or scientific notations are to be rendered
 as an integral part of the data display.  Ploticus is also not
 intended as a "marketing" graphics package.  Its goal is to
 display data crisply without extra decoration and distracting
 "dingbats" that cloud the picture.
 .
 Ploticus supports a wide range of output options, including jpeg
 (Joint Photographics Experts Group format), png (Portable Network
 Graphics format), svg (Simple Vector Graphics), bmp (Microsoft BitMaP),
 ps (PostScript), swf (Flash), and X11.

Description: Scientific plotting library (wxWidgets driver)
 PLplot is relatively small, portable, freely distributable, and is rich
 enough to satisfy most users.  It has a wide range of plot types including
 line (linear, log), contour, 3D, fill, and almost 1000 characters
 (including Greek and mathematical) in its extended font set.  The package
 is designed to make it easy to quickly get graphical output; only a
 handful of function calls is typically required.  For more advanced use,
 virtually all aspects of plotting are configurable.
 .
 This package provides the wxWidgets driver module for PLplot.

Description: Access EPOC device (Psion PDA) over a serial link
 This package lets you access EPOC devices' drives over a serial link.
 You can mount them NFS-style, access them FTP-style, use a local
 printer from the remote device (EPOC32 only) and perform
 backup/restore.
 .
 The software is related to p3nfs, which is also packaged for
 Debian, but plptools uses the native Psion protocol, whereas p3nfs
 requires a program to be installed on the Psion.
 .
 Version 1.0 and later no longer provide specific KDE integration.
