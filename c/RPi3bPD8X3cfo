=head1 METHODS

Math::BigFloat supports all methods that Math::BigInt supports, except it
calculates non-integer results when possible. Please see L<Math::BigInt>
for a full description of each method. Below are just the most important
differences:

=over

=item accuracy()

      $x->accuracy(5);           # local for $x
      CLASS->accuracy(5);        # global for all members of CLASS
                                 # Note: This also applies to new()!

      $A = $x->accuracy();       # read out accuracy that affects $x
      $A = CLASS->accuracy();    # read out global accuracy

Set or get the global or local accuracy, aka how many significant digits the
results have. If you set a global accuracy, then this also applies to new()!

Warning! The accuracy I<sticks>, e.g. once you created a number under the
influence of C<< CLASS->accuracy($A) >>, all results from math operations with
that number will also be rounded.

In most cases, you should probably round the results explicitly using one of
L<Math::BigInt/round()>, L<Math::BigInt/bround()> or L<Math::BigInt/bfround()> or by passing the desired accuracy
to the math operation as additional parameter:

        my $x = Math::BigInt->new(30000);
        my $y = Math::BigInt->new(7);
        print scalar $x->copy()->bdiv($y, 2);           # print 4300
        print scalar $x->copy()->bdiv($y)->bround(2);   # print 4300

=item precision()

      $x->precision(-2);      # local for $x, round at the second
                              # digit right of the dot
      $x->precision(2);       # ditto, round at the second digit
                              # left of the dot

      CLASS->precision(5);    # Global for all members of CLASS
                              # This also applies to new()!
      CLASS->precision(-5);   # ditto

      $P = CLASS->precision();  # read out global precision
      $P = $x->precision();     # read out precision that affects $x

Note: You probably want to use L</accuracy()> instead. With L</accuracy()> you
set the number of digits each result should have, with L</precision()> you
set the place where to round!

=item bexp()

	$x->bexp($accuracy);		# calculate e ** X

Calculates the expression C<e ** $x> where C<e> is Euler's number.

This method was added in v1.82 of Math::BigInt (April 2007).

=item bnok()

	$x->bnok($y);	# x over y (binomial coefficient n over k)

Calculates the binomial coefficient n over k, also called the "choose"
function. The result is equivalent to:

	( n )      n!
	| - |  = -------
	( k )    k!(n-k)!

This method was added in v1.84 of Math::BigInt (April 2007).

=item bpi()

	print Math::BigFloat->bpi(100), "\n";

Calculate PI to N digits (including the 3 before the dot). The result is
rounded according to the current rounding mode, which defaults to "even".

This method was added in v1.87 of Math::BigInt (June 2007).

=item bcos()

	my $x = Math::BigFloat->new(1);
	print $x->bcos(100), "\n";

Calculate the cosinus of $x, modifying $x in place.

This method was added in v1.87 of Math::BigInt (June 2007).

=item bsin()

	my $x = Math::BigFloat->new(1);
	print $x->bsin(100), "\n";

Calculate the sinus of $x, modifying $x in place.

This method was added in v1.87 of Math::BigInt (June 2007).

=item batan2()

	my $y = Math::BigFloat->new(2);
	my $x = Math::BigFloat->new(3);
	print $y->batan2($x), "\n";

Calculate the arcus tanges of C<$y> divided by C<$x>, modifying $y in place.
See also L</batan()>.

This method was added in v1.87 of Math::BigInt (June 2007).

=item batan()

	my $x = Math::BigFloat->new(1);
	print $x->batan(100), "\n";

Calculate the arcus tanges of $x, modifying $x in place. See also L</batan2()>.

This method was added in v1.87 of Math::BigInt (June 2007).

=item bmuladd()

	$x->bmuladd($y,$z);

Multiply $x by $y, and then add $z to the result.

This method was added in v1.87 of Math::BigInt (June 2007).

=head1 Autocreating constants

After C<use Math::BigFloat ':constant'> all the floating point constants
in the given scope are converted to C<Math::BigFloat>. This conversion
happens at compile time.

In particular

  perl -MMath::BigFloat=:constant -e 'print 2E-100,"\n"'

prints the value of C<2E-100>. Note that without conversion of 
constants the expression 2E-100 will be calculated as normal floating point 
number.

Please note that ':constant' does not affect integer constants, nor binary 
nor hexadecimal constants. Use L<bignum> or L<Math::BigInt> to get this to
work.

=head2 Math library

Math with the numbers is done (by default) by a module called
Math::BigInt::Calc. This is equivalent to saying:

	use Math::BigFloat lib => 'Calc';

You can change this by using:

	use Math::BigFloat lib => 'GMP';

B<Note>: General purpose packages should not be explicit about the library
to use; let the script author decide which is best.

Note: The keyword 'lib' will warn when the requested library could not be
loaded. To suppress the warning use 'try' instead:

	use Math::BigFloat try => 'GMP';

If your script works with huge numbers and Calc is too slow for them,
you can also for the loading of one of these libraries and if none
of them can be used, the code will die:

        use Math::BigFloat only => 'GMP,Pari';

The following would first try to find Math::BigInt::Foo, then
Math::BigInt::Bar, and when this also fails, revert to Math::BigInt::Calc:

	use Math::BigFloat lib => 'Foo,Math::BigInt::Bar';

See the respective low-level library documentation for further details.

Please note that Math::BigFloat does B<not> use the denoted library itself,
but it merely passes the lib argument to Math::BigInt. So, instead of the need
to do:

	use Math::BigInt lib => 'GMP';
	use Math::BigFloat;

you can roll it all into one line:

	use Math::BigFloat lib => 'GMP';

It is also possible to just require Math::BigFloat:

	require Math::BigFloat;

This will load the necessary things (like BigInt) when they are needed, and
automatically.

See L<Math::BigInt> for more details than you ever wanted to know about using
a different low-level library.

=head2 Using Math::BigInt::Lite

For backwards compatibility reasons it is still possible to
request a different storage class for use with Math::BigFloat:

        use Math::BigFloat with => 'Math::BigInt::Lite';

However, this request is ignored, as the current code now uses the low-level
math library for directly storing the number parts.

=head1 EXPORTS

C<Math::BigFloat> exports nothing by default, but can export the C<bpi()> method:

	use Math::BigFloat qw/bpi/;

	print bpi(10), "\n";

=head1 BUGS

Please see the file BUGS in the CPAN distribution Math::BigInt for known bugs.

=head1 CAVEATS

Do not try to be clever to insert some operations in between switching
libraries:

    require Math::BigFloat;
    my $matter = Math::BigFloat->bone() + 4;	# load BigInt and Calc
    Math::BigFloat->import( lib => 'Pari' );	# load Pari, too
    my $anti_matter = Math::BigFloat->bone()+4;	# now use Pari

This will create objects with numbers stored in two different backend libraries,
and B<VERY BAD THINGS> will happen when you use these together:

	my $flash_and_bang = $matter + $anti_matter;	# Don't do this!

=over

=item stringify, bstr()

Both stringify and bstr() now drop the leading '+'. The old code would return
'+1.23', the new returns '1.23'. See the documentation in L<Math::BigInt> for
reasoning and details.

=item bdiv()

The following will probably not print what you expect:

	print $c->bdiv(123.456),"\n";

It prints both quotient and remainder since print works in list context. Also,
bdiv() will modify $c, so be careful. You probably want to use

    print $c / 123.456,"\n";
    # or if you want to modify $c:
    print scalar $c->bdiv(123.456),"\n";

instead.

=item brsft()

The following will probably not print what you expect:

	my $c = Math::BigFloat->new('3.14159');
        print $c->brsft(3,10),"\n";	# prints 0.00314153.1415

It prints both quotient and remainder, since print calls C<brsft()> in list
context. Also, C<< $c->brsft() >> will modify $c, so be careful.
You probably want to use

	print scalar $c->copy()->brsft(3,10),"\n";
	# or if you really want to modify $c
        print scalar $c->brsft(3,10),"\n";

instead.

=item Modifying and =

Beware of:

	$x = Math::BigFloat->new(5);
	$y = $x;

It will not do what you think, e.g. making a copy of $x. Instead it just makes
a second reference to the B<same> object and stores it in $y. Thus anything
that modifies $x will modify $y (except overloaded math operators), and vice
versa. See L<Math::BigInt> for details and how to avoid that.

=item bpow()

C<bpow()> now modifies the first argument, unlike the old code which left
it alone and only returned the result. This is to be consistent with
C<badd()> etc. The first will modify $x, the second one won't:

	print bpow($x,$i),"\n"; 	# modify $x
	print $x->bpow($i),"\n"; 	# ditto
	print $x ** $i,"\n";		# leave $x alone 

=item precision() vs. accuracy()

A common pitfall is to use L</precision()> when you want to round a result to
a certain number of digits:

    use Math::BigFloat;

    Math::BigFloat->precision(4);	    # does not do what you
					    # think it does
    my $x = Math::BigFloat->new(12345);	    # rounds $x to "12000"!
    print "$x\n";			    # print "12000"
    my $y = Math::BigFloat->new(3);	    # rounds $y to "0"!
    print "$y\n";			    # print "0"
    $z = $x / $y;			    # 12000 / 0 => NaN!
    print "$z\n";
    print $z->precision(),"\n";		    # 4

Replacing L</precision()> with L</accuracy()> is probably not what you want, either:

    use Math::BigFloat;

    Math::BigFloat->accuracy(4);	  # enables global rounding:
    my $x = Math::BigFloat->new(123456);  # rounded immediately
                                          #   to "12350"
    print "$x\n";			  # print "123500"
    my $y = Math::BigFloat->new(3);	  # rounded to "3
    print "$y\n";			  # print "3"
    print $z = $x->copy()->bdiv($y),"\n"; # 41170
    print $z->accuracy(),"\n";		  # 4

What you want to use instead is:

    use Math::BigFloat;

    my $x = Math::BigFloat->new(123456);    # no rounding
    print "$x\n";			    # print "123456"
    my $y = Math::BigFloat->new(3);	    # no rounding
    print "$y\n";			    # print "3"
    print $z = $x->copy()->bdiv($y,4),"\n"; # 41150
    print $z->accuracy(),"\n";		    # undef

In addition to computing what you expected, the last example also does B<not>
"taint" the result with an accuracy or precision setting, which would
influence any further operation.

# Package to store unsigned big integers in decimal and do math with them

# Internally the numbers are stored in an array with at least 1 element, no
# leading zero parts (except the first) and in base 1eX where X is determined
# automatically at loading time to be the maximum possible value

# todo:
# - fully remove funky $# stuff in div() (maybe - that code scares me...)

# USE_MUL: due to problems on certain os (os390, posix-bc) "* 1e-5" is used
# instead of "/ 1e5" at some places, (marked with USE_MUL). Other platforms
# BS2000, some Crays need USE_DIV instead.
# The BEGIN block is used to determine which of the two variants gives the
# correct result.

# Beware of things like:
# $i = $i * $y + $car; $car = int($i / $BASE); $i = $i % $BASE;
# This works on x86, but fails on ARM (SA1100, iPAQ) due to who knows what
# reasons. So, use this instead (slower, but correct):
# $i = $i * $y + $car; $car = int($i / $BASE); $i -= $BASE * $car;

=head1 NAME

Math::BigInt::Calc - Pure Perl module to support Math::BigInt

=head1 SYNOPSIS

This library provides support for big integer calculations. It is not
intended to be used by other modules. Other modules which support the same
API (see below) can also be used to support Math::BigInt, like
Math::BigInt::GMP and Math::BigInt::Pari.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

In this library, the numbers are represented in base B = 10**N, where N is
the largest possible value that does not cause overflow in the intermediate
computations. The base B elements are stored in an array, with the least
significant element stored in array element zero. There are no leading zero
elements, except a single zero element when the number is zero.

For instance, if B = 10000, the number 1234567890 is represented internally
as [3456, 7890, 12].

=head1 THE Math::BigInt API

In order to allow for multiple big integer libraries, Math::BigInt was
rewritten to use a plug-in library for core math routines. Any module which
conforms to the API can be used by Math::BigInt by using this in your program:

	use Math::BigInt lib => 'libname';

'libname' is either the long name, like 'Math::BigInt::Pari', or only the short
version, like 'Pari'.

=head2 General Notes

A library only needs to deal with unsigned big integers. Testing of input
parameter validity is done by the caller, so there is no need to worry about
underflow (e.g., in C<_sub()> and C<_dec()>) nor about division by zero (e.g.,
in C<_div()>) or similar cases.

For some methods, the first parameter can be modified. That includes the
possibility that you return a reference to a completely different object
instead. Although keeping the reference and just changing its contents is
preferred over creating and returning a different reference.

Return values are always objects, strings, Perl scalars, or true/false for
comparison routines.

=head2 API version 1

The following methods must be defined in order to support the use by
Math::BigInt v1.70 or later.

=head3 API version

=over 4

=item I<api_version()>

Return API version as a Perl scalar, 1 for Math::BigInt v1.70, 2 for
Math::BigInt v1.83.

=back

=head3 Constructors

=over 4

=item I<_new(STR)>

Convert a string representing an unsigned decimal number to an object
representing the same number. The input is normalize, i.e., it matches
C<^(0|[1-9]\d*)$>.

=item I<_zero()>

Return an object representing the number zero.

=item I<_one()>

Return an object representing the number one.

=item I<_two()>

Return an object representing the number two.

=item I<_ten()>

Return an object representing the number ten.

=item I<_from_bin(STR)>

Return an object given a string representing a binary number. The input has a
'0b' prefix and matches the regular expression C<^0[bB](0|1[01]*)$>.

=item I<_from_oct(STR)>

Return an object given a string representing an octal number. The input has a
'0' prefix and matches the regular expression C<^0[1-7]*$>.

=item I<_from_hex(STR)>

Return an object given a string representing a hexadecimal number. The input
has a '0x' prefix and matches the regular expression
C<^0x(0|[1-9a-fA-F][\da-fA-F]*)$>.

=back

=head3 Mathematical functions

Each of these methods may modify the first input argument, except I<_bgcd()>,
which shall not modify any input argument, and I<_sub()> which may modify the
second input argument.

=over 4

=item I<_add(OBJ1, OBJ2)>

Returns the result of adding OBJ2 to OBJ1.

=item I<_mul(OBJ1, OBJ2)>

Returns the result of multiplying OBJ2 and OBJ1.

=item I<_div(OBJ1, OBJ2)>

Returns the result of dividing OBJ1 by OBJ2 and truncating the result to an
integer.

=item I<_sub(OBJ1, OBJ2, FLAG)>

=item I<_sub(OBJ1, OBJ2)>

Returns the result of subtracting OBJ2 by OBJ1. If C<flag> is false or omitted,
OBJ1 might be modified. If C<flag> is true, OBJ2 might be modified.

=item I<_dec(OBJ)>

Decrement OBJ by one.

=item I<_inc(OBJ)>

Increment OBJ by one.

=item I<_mod(OBJ1, OBJ2)>

Return OBJ1 modulo OBJ2, i.e., the remainder after dividing OBJ1 by OBJ2.

=item I<_sqrt(OBJ)>

Return the square root of the object, truncated to integer.

=item I<_root(OBJ, N)>

Return Nth root of the object, truncated to int. N is E<gt>= 3.

=item I<_fac(OBJ)>

Return factorial of object (1*2*3*4*...).

=item I<_pow(OBJ1, OBJ2)>

Return OBJ1 to the power of OBJ2. By convention, 0**0 = 1.

=item I<_modinv(OBJ1, OBJ2)>

Return modular multiplicative inverse, i.e., return OBJ3 so that

    (OBJ3 * OBJ1) % OBJ2 = 1 % OBJ2

The result is returned as two arguments. If the modular multiplicative
inverse does not exist, both arguments are undefined. Otherwise, the
arguments are a number (object) and its sign ("+" or "-").

The output value, with its sign, must either be a positive value in the
range 1,2,...,OBJ2-1 or the same value subtracted OBJ2. For instance, if the
input arguments are objects representing the numbers 7 and 5, the method
must either return an object representing the number 3 and a "+" sign, since
(3*7) % 5 = 1 % 5, or an object representing the number 2 and "-" sign,
since (-2*7) % 5 = 1 % 5.

=item I<_modpow(OBJ1, OBJ2, OBJ3)>

Return modular exponentiation, (OBJ1 ** OBJ2) % OBJ3.

=item I<_rsft(OBJ, N, B)>

Shift object N digits right in base B and return the resulting object. This is
equivalent to performing integer division by B**N and discarding the remainder,
except that it might be much faster, depending on how the number is represented
internally.

For instance, if the object $obj represents the hexadecimal number 0xabcde,
then C<_rsft($obj, 2, 16)> returns an object representing the number 0xabc. The
"remainer", 0xde, is discarded and not returned.

=item I<_lsft(OBJ, N, B)>

Shift the object N digits left in base B. This is equivalent to multiplying by
B**N, except that it might be much faster, depending on how the number is
represented internally.

=item I<_log_int(OBJ, B)>

Return integer log of OBJ to base BASE. This method has two output arguments,
the OBJECT and a STATUS. The STATUS is Perl scalar; it is 1 if OBJ is the exact
result, 0 if the result was truncted to give OBJ, and undef if it is unknown
whether OBJ is the exact result.

=item I<_gcd(OBJ1, OBJ2)>

Return the greatest common divisor of OBJ1 and OBJ2.

=back

=head3 Bitwise operators

Each of these methods may modify the first input argument.

=over 4

=item I<_and(OBJ1, OBJ2)>

Return bitwise and. If necessary, the smallest number is padded with leading
zeros.

=item I<_or(OBJ1, OBJ2)>

Return bitwise or. If necessary, the smallest number is padded with leading
zeros.

=item I<_xor(OBJ1, OBJ2)>

Return bitwise exclusive or. If necessary, the smallest number is padded
with leading zeros.

=back

=head3 Boolean operators

=over 4

=item I<_is_zero(OBJ)>

Returns a true value if OBJ is zero, and false value otherwise.

=item I<_is_one(OBJ)>

Returns a true value if OBJ is one, and false value otherwise.

=item I<_is_two(OBJ)>

Returns a true value if OBJ is two, and false value otherwise.

=item I<_is_ten(OBJ)>

Returns a true value if OBJ is ten, and false value otherwise.

=item I<_is_even(OBJ)>

Return a true value if OBJ is an even integer, and a false value otherwise.

=item I<_is_odd(OBJ)>

Return a true value if OBJ is an even integer, and a false value otherwise.

=item I<_acmp(OBJ1, OBJ2)>

Compare OBJ1 and OBJ2 and return -1, 0, or 1, if OBJ1 is less than, equal
to, or larger than OBJ2, respectively.

=back

=head3 String conversion

=over 4

=item I<_str(OBJ)>

Return a string representing the object. The returned string should have no
leading zeros, i.e., it should match C<^(0|[1-9]\d*)$>.

=item I<_as_bin(OBJ)>

Return the binary string representation of the number. The string must have a
'0b' prefix.

=item I<_as_oct(OBJ)>

Return the octal string representation of the number. The string must have
a '0x' prefix.

Note: This method was required from Math::BigInt version 1.78, but the required
API version number was not incremented, so there are older libraries that
support API version 1, but do not support C<_as_oct()>.

=item I<_as_hex(OBJ)>

Return the hexadecimal string representation of the number. The string must
have a '0x' prefix.

=back

=head3 Numeric conversion

=over 4

=item I<_num(OBJ)>

Given an object, return a Perl scalar number (int/float) representing this
number.

=back

=head3 Miscellaneous

=over 4

=item I<_copy(OBJ)>

Return a true copy of the object.

=item I<_len(OBJ)>

Returns the number of the decimal digits in the number. The output is a
Perl scalar.

=item I<_zeros(OBJ)>

Return the number of trailing decimal zeros. The output is a Perl scalar.

=item I<_digit(OBJ, N)>

Return the Nth digit as a Perl scalar. N is a Perl scalar, where zero refers to
the rightmost (least significant) digit, and negative values count from the
left (most significant digit). If $obj represents the number 123, then
I<_digit($obj, 0)> is 3 and I<_digit(123, -1)> is 1.

=item I<_check(OBJ)>

Return a true value if the object is OK, and a false value otherwise. This is a
check routine to test the internal state of the object for corruption.

=back

=head2 API version 2

The following methods are required for an API version of 2 or greater.

=head3 Constructors

=over 4

=item I<_1ex(N)>

Return an object representing the number 10**N where N E<gt>= 0 is a Perl
scalar.

=back

=head3 Mathematical functions

=over 4

=item I<_nok(OBJ1, OBJ2)>

Return the binomial coefficient OBJ1 over OBJ1.

=back

=head3 Miscellaneous

=over 4

=item I<_alen(OBJ)>

Return the approximate number of decimal digits of the object. The
output is one Perl scalar. This estimate must be greater than or equal
to what C<_len()> returns.

=back

=head2 API optional methods

The following methods are optional, and can be defined if the underlying lib
has a fast way to do them. If undefined, Math::BigInt will use pure Perl (hence
slow) fallback routines to emulate these:

=head3 Signed bitwise operators.

Each of these methods may modify the first input argument.

=over 4

=item I<_signed_or(OBJ1, OBJ2, SIGN1, SIGN2)>

Return the signed bitwise or.

=item I<_signed_and(OBJ1, OBJ2, SIGN1, SIGN2)>

Return the signed bitwise and.

=item I<_signed_xor(OBJ1, OBJ2, SIGN1, SIGN2)>

Return the signed bitwise exclusive or.

=back

=head1 WRAP YOUR OWN

If you want to port your own favourite c-lib for big numbers to the
Math::BigInt interface, you can take any of the already existing modules as
a rough guideline. You should really wrap up the latest BigInt and BigFloat
testsuites with your module, and replace in them any of the following:

	use Math::BigInt;

by this:

	use Math::BigInt lib => 'yourlib';

This way you ensure that your library really works 100% within Math::BigInt.

=head1 NAME

Archive::Tar - module for manipulations of tar archives

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use Archive::Tar;
    my $tar = Archive::Tar->new;

    $tar->read('origin.tgz');
    $tar->extract();

    $tar->add_files('file/foo.pl', 'docs/README');
    $tar->add_data('file/baz.txt', 'This is the contents now');

    $tar->rename('oldname', 'new/file/name');
    $tar->chown('/', 'root');
    $tar->chown('/', 'root:root');
    $tar->chmod('/tmp', '1777');

    $tar->write('files.tar');                   # plain tar
    $tar->write('files.tgz', COMPRESS_GZIP);    # gzip compressed
    $tar->write('files.tbz', COMPRESS_BZIP);    # bzip2 compressed

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Archive::Tar provides an object oriented mechanism for handling tar
files.  It provides class methods for quick and easy files handling
while also allowing for the creation of tar file objects for custom
manipulation.  If you have the IO::Zlib module installed,
Archive::Tar will also support compressed or gzipped tar files.

An object of class Archive::Tar represents a .tar(.gz) archive full
of files and things.

=head1 Object Methods

=head2 Archive::Tar->new( [$file, $compressed] )

Returns a new Tar object. If given any arguments, C<new()> calls the
C<read()> method automatically, passing on the arguments provided to
the C<read()> method.

If C<new()> is invoked with arguments and the C<read()> method fails
for any reason, C<new()> returns undef.

=cut

my $tmpl = {
    _data   => [ ],
    _file   => 'Unknown',
};

### install get/set accessors for this object.
for my $key ( keys %$tmpl ) {
    no strict 'refs';
    *{__PACKAGE__."::$key"} = sub {
        my $self = shift;
        $self->{$key} = $_[0] if @_;
        return $self->{$key};
    }
}

sub new {
    my $class = shift;
    $class = ref $class if ref $class;

    ### copying $tmpl here since a shallow copy makes it use the
    ### same aref, causing for files to remain in memory always.
    my $obj = bless { _data => [ ], _file => 'Unknown', _error => '' }, $class;

    if (@_) {
        unless ( $obj->read( @_ ) ) {
            $obj->_error(qq[No data could be read from file]);
            return;
        }
    }

    return $obj;
}

=head2 $tar->read ( $filename|$handle, [$compressed, {opt => 'val'}] )

Read the given tar file into memory.
The first argument can either be the name of a file or a reference to
an already open filehandle (or an IO::Zlib object if it's compressed)

The C<read> will I<replace> any previous content in C<$tar>!

The second argument may be considered optional, but remains for
backwards compatibility. Archive::Tar now looks at the file
magic to determine what class should be used to open the file
and will transparently Do The Right Thing.

Archive::Tar will warn if you try to pass a bzip2 compressed file and the
IO::Zlib / IO::Uncompress::Bunzip2 modules are not available and simply return.

Note that you can currently B<not> pass a C<gzip> compressed
filehandle, which is not opened with C<IO::Zlib>, a C<bzip2> compressed
filehandle, which is not opened with C<IO::Uncompress::Bunzip2>, nor a string
containing the full archive information (either compressed or
uncompressed). These are worth while features, but not currently
implemented. See the C<TODO> section.

The third argument can be a hash reference with options. Note that
all options are case-sensitive.

=over 4

=item limit

Do not read more than C<limit> files. This is useful if you have
very big archives, and are only interested in the first few files.

=item filter

Can be set to a regular expression.  Only files with names that match
the expression will be read.

=item md5

Set to 1 and the md5sum of files will be returned (instead of file data)
    my $iter = Archive::Tar->iter( $file,  1, {md5 => 1} );
    while( my $f = $iter->() ) {
        print $f->data . "\t" . $f->full_path . $/;
    }

=item extract

If set to true, immediately extract entries when reading them. This
gives you the same memory break as the C<extract_archive> function.
Note however that entries will not be read into memory, but written
straight to disk. This means no C<Archive::Tar::File> objects are
created for you to inspect.

=back

All files are stored internally as C<Archive::Tar::File> objects.
Please consult the L<Archive::Tar::File> documentation for details.

Returns the number of files read in scalar context, and a list of
C<Archive::Tar::File> objects in list context.

=head2 $tar->contains_file( $filename )

Check if the archive contains a certain file.
It will return true if the file is in the archive, false otherwise.

Note however, that this function does an exact match using C<eq>
on the full path. So it cannot compensate for case-insensitive file-
systems or compare 2 paths to see if they would point to the same
underlying file.

}

=head2 $tar->extract( [@filenames] )

Write files whose names are equivalent to any of the names in
C<@filenames> to disk, creating subdirectories as necessary. This
might not work too well under VMS.
Under MacPerl, the file's modification time will be converted to the
MacOS zero of time, and appropriate conversions will be done to the
path.  However, the length of each element of the path is not
inspected to see whether it's longer than MacOS currently allows (32
characters).

If C<extract> is called without a list of file names, the entire
contents of the archive are extracted.

Returns a list of filenames extracted.

=head2 $tar->extract_file( $file, [$extract_path] )

Write an entry, whose name is equivalent to the file name provided to
disk. Optionally takes a second parameter, which is the full native
path (including filename) the entry will be written to.

For example:

    $tar->extract_file( 'name/in/archive', 'name/i/want/to/give/it' );

    $tar->extract_file( $at_file_object,   'name/i/want/to/give/it' );

=head2 $tar->list_files( [\@properties] )

Returns a list of the names of all the files in the archive.

If C<list_files()> is passed an array reference as its first argument
it returns a list of hash references containing the requested
properties of each file.  The following list of properties is
supported: name, size, mtime (last modified date), mode, uid, gid,
linkname, uname, gname, devmajor, devminor, prefix.

Passing an array reference containing only one element, 'name', is
special cased to return a list of names rather than a list of hash
references, making it equivalent to calling C<list_files> without
arguments.

=head2 $tar->write ( [$file, $compressed, $prefix] )

Write the in-memory archive to disk.  The first argument can either
be the name of a file or a reference to an already open filehandle (a
GLOB reference).

The second argument is used to indicate compression. You can either
compress using C<gzip> or C<bzip2>. If you pass a digit, it's assumed
to be the C<gzip> compression level (between 1 and 9), but the use of
constants is preferred:

  # write a gzip compressed file
  $tar->write( 'out.tgz', COMPRESS_GZIP );

  # write a bzip compressed file
  $tar->write( 'out.tbz', COMPRESS_BZIP );

Note that when you pass in a filehandle, the compression argument
is ignored, as all files are printed verbatim to your filehandle.
If you wish to enable compression with filehandles, use an
C<IO::Zlib> or C<IO::Compress::Bzip2> filehandle instead.

The third argument is an optional prefix. All files will be tucked
away in the directory you specify as prefix. So if you have files
'a' and 'b' in your archive, and you specify 'foo' as prefix, they
will be written to the archive as 'foo/a' and 'foo/b'.

If no arguments are given, C<write> returns the entire formatted
archive as a string, which could be useful if you'd like to stuff the
archive into a socket or a pipe to gzip or something.

=head2 $tar->add_files( @filenamelist )

Takes a list of filenames and adds them to the in-memory archive.

The path to the file is automatically converted to a Unix like
equivalent for use in the archive, and, if on MacOS, the file's
modification time is converted from the MacOS epoch to the Unix epoch.
So tar archives created on MacOS with B<Archive::Tar> can be read
both with I<tar> on Unix and applications like I<suntar> or
I<Stuffit Expander> on MacOS.

Be aware that the file's type/creator and resource fork will be lost,
which is usually what you want in cross-platform archives.

Instead of a filename, you can also pass it an existing C<Archive::Tar::File>
object from, for example, another archive. The object will be clone, and
effectively be a copy of the original, not an alias.

Returns a list of C<Archive::Tar::File> objects that were just added.

=cut

    return @rv;
}

=head2 $tar->add_data ( $filename, $data, [$opthashref] )

Takes a filename, a scalar full of data and optionally a reference to
a hash with specific options.

Will add a file to the in-memory archive, with name C<$filename> and
content C<$data>. Specific properties can be set using C<$opthashref>.
The following list of properties is supported: name, size, mtime
(last modified date), mode, uid, gid, linkname, uname, gname,
devmajor, devminor, prefix, type.  (On MacOS, the file's path and
modification times are converted to Unix equivalents.)

Valid values for the file type are the following constants defined by
Archive::Tar::Constant:

=over 4

=item FILE

Regular file.

=item HARDLINK

=item SYMLINK

Hard and symbolic ("soft") links; linkname should specify target.

=item CHARDEV

=item BLOCKDEV

Character and block devices. devmajor and devminor should specify the major
and minor device numbers.

=item DIR

Directory.

=item FIFO

FIFO (named pipe).

=item SOCKET

Socket.

=back

Returns the C<Archive::Tar::File> object that was just added, or
C<undef> on failure.

=cut

    my $self    = shift;

    return $obj;
}

=head2 $tar->error( [$BOOL] )

Returns the current error string (usually, the last error reported).
If a true value was specified, it will give the C<Carp::longmess>
equivalent of the error, in effect giving you a stacktrace.

For backwards compatibility, this error is also available as
C<$Archive::Tar::error> although it is much recommended you use the
method call instead.

=head2 $tar->setcwd( $cwd );

C<Archive::Tar> needs to know the current directory, and it will run
C<Cwd::cwd()> I<every> time it extracts a I<relative> entry from the
tarfile and saves it in the file system. (As of version 1.30, however,
C<Archive::Tar> will use the speed optimization described below
automatically, so it's only relevant if you're using C<extract_file()>).

Since C<Archive::Tar> doesn't change the current directory internally
while it is extracting the items in a tarball, all calls to C<Cwd::cwd()>
can be avoided if we can guarantee that the current directory doesn't
get changed externally.

To use this performance boost, set the current directory via

    use Cwd;
    $tar->setcwd( cwd() );

once before calling a function like C<extract_file> and
C<Archive::Tar> will use the current directory setting from then on
and won't call C<Cwd::cwd()> internally.

To switch back to the default behaviour, use

    $tar->setcwd( undef );

and C<Archive::Tar> will call C<Cwd::cwd()> internally again.

If you're using C<Archive::Tar>'s C<extract()> method, C<setcwd()> will
be called for you.

=head1 Class Methods

=head2 Archive::Tar->create_archive($file, $compressed, @filelist)

Creates a tar file from the list of files provided.  The first
argument can either be the name of the tar file to create or a
reference to an open file handle (e.g. a GLOB reference).

The second argument is used to indicate compression. You can either
compress using C<gzip> or C<bzip2>. If you pass a digit, it's assumed
to be the C<gzip> compression level (between 1 and 9), but the use of
constants is preferred:

  # write a gzip compressed file
  Archive::Tar->create_archive( 'out.tgz', COMPRESS_GZIP, @filelist );

  # write a bzip compressed file
  Archive::Tar->create_archive( 'out.tbz', COMPRESS_BZIP, @filelist );

Note that when you pass in a filehandle, the compression argument
is ignored, as all files are printed verbatim to your filehandle.
If you wish to enable compression with filehandles, use an
C<IO::Zlib> or C<IO::Compress::Bzip2> filehandle instead.

The remaining arguments list the files to be included in the tar file.
These files must all exist. Any files which don't exist or can't be
read are silently ignored.

If the archive creation fails for any reason, C<create_archive> will
return false. Please use the C<error> method to find the cause of the
failure.

Note that this method does not write C<on the fly> as it were; it
still reads all the files into memory before writing out the archive.
Consult the FAQ below if this is a problem.

=cut

sub create_archive {
    my $class = shift;

    my $file    = shift; return unless defined $file;
    my $gzip    = shift || 0;
    my @files   = @_;

    unless( @files ) {
        return $class->_error( qq[Cowardly refusing to create empty archive!] );
    }

    my $tar = $class->new;
    $tar->add_files( @files );
    return $tar->write( $file, $gzip );
}

=head2 Archive::Tar->iter( $filename, [ $compressed, {opt => $val} ] )

Returns an iterator function that reads the tar file without loading
it all in memory.  Each time the function is called it will return the
next file in the tarball. The files are returned as
C<Archive::Tar::File> objects. The iterator function returns the
empty list once it has exhausted the files contained.

The second argument can be a hash reference with options, which are
identical to the arguments passed to C<read()>.

Example usage:

    my $next = Archive::Tar->iter( "example.tar.gz", 1, {filter => qr/\.pm$/} );

    while( my $f = $next->() ) {
        print $f->name, "\n";

        $f->extract or warn "Extraction failed";

        # ....
    }

    ### get a handle to read from.

        return                  unless $handle; # handle exhausted?

        ### read data, should only return file
        my $tarfile = $class->_read_tar($handle, { %$opts, limit => 1 });
        @data = @$tarfile if ref $tarfile && ref $tarfile eq 'ARRAY';

				}

        ### return one piece of data
        return shift(@data)     if @data;

        ### data is exhausted, free the filehandle
        undef $handle;

					undef $CONSTRUCT_ARGS->[-1];
				}
        return;
    };
}

=head2 Archive::Tar->list_archive($file, $compressed, [\@properties])

Returns a list of the names of all the files in the archive.  The
first argument can either be the name of the tar file to list or a
reference to an open file handle (e.g. a GLOB reference).

If C<list_archive()> is passed an array reference as its third
argument it returns a list of hash references containing the requested
properties of each file.  The following list of properties is
supported: full_path, name, size, mtime (last modified date), mode,
uid, gid, linkname, uname, gname, devmajor, devminor, prefix, type.

See C<Archive::Tar::File> for details about supported properties.

Passing an array reference containing only one element, 'name', is
special cased to return a list of names rather than a list of hash
references.

=head2 Archive::Tar->extract_archive($file, $compressed)

Extracts the contents of the tar file.  The first argument can either
be the name of the tar file to create or a reference to an open file
handle (e.g. a GLOB reference).  All relative paths in the tar file will
be created underneath the current working directory.

C<extract_archive> will return a list of files it extracted.
If the archive extraction fails for any reason, C<extract_archive>
will return false.  Please use the C<error> method to find the cause
of the failure.

=head2 $bool = Archive::Tar->has_io_string

Returns true if we currently have C<IO::String> support loaded.

available.

__END__

=head1 GLOBAL VARIABLES

=head2 $Archive::Tar::FOLLOW_SYMLINK

Set this variable to C<1> to make C<Archive::Tar> effectively make a
copy of the file when extracting. Default is C<0>, which
means the symlink stays intact. Of course, you will have to pack the
file linked to as well.

This option is checked when you write out the tarfile using C<write>
or C<create_archive>.

This works just like C</bin/tar>'s C<-h> option.

=head2 $Archive::Tar::CHOWN

By default, C<Archive::Tar> will try to C<chown> your files if it is
able to. In some cases, this may not be desired. In that case, set
this variable to C<0> to disable C<chown>-ing, even if it were
possible.

The default is C<1>.

=head2 $Archive::Tar::CHMOD

By default, C<Archive::Tar> will try to C<chmod> your files to
whatever mode was specified for the particular file in the archive.
In some cases, this may not be desired. In that case, set this
variable to C<0> to disable C<chmod>-ing.

The default is C<1>.

=head2 $Archive::Tar::SAME_PERMISSIONS

When, C<$Archive::Tar::CHMOD> is enabled, this setting controls whether
the permissions on files from the archive are used without modification
of if they are filtered by removing any setid bits and applying the
current umask.

The default is C<1> for the root user and C<0> for normal users.

=head2 $Archive::Tar::DO_NOT_USE_PREFIX

By default, C<Archive::Tar> will try to put paths that are over
100 characters in the C<prefix> field of your tar header, as
defined per POSIX-standard. However, some (older) tar programs
do not implement this spec. To retain compatibility with these older
or non-POSIX compliant versions, you can set the C<$DO_NOT_USE_PREFIX>
variable to a true value, and C<Archive::Tar> will use an alternate
way of dealing with paths over 100 characters by using the
C<GNU Extended Header> feature.

Note that clients who do not support the C<GNU Extended Header>
feature will not be able to read these archives. Such clients include
tars on C<Solaris>, C<Irix> and C<AIX>.

The default is C<0>.

=head2 $Archive::Tar::DEBUG

Set this variable to C<1> to always get the C<Carp::longmess> output
of the warnings, instead of the regular C<carp>. This is the same
message you would get by doing:

    $tar->error(1);

Defaults to C<0>.

=head2 $Archive::Tar::WARN

Set this variable to C<0> if you do not want any warnings printed.
Personally I recommend against doing this, but people asked for the
option. Also, be advised that this is of course not threadsafe.

Defaults to C<1>.

=head2 $Archive::Tar::error

Holds the last reported error. Kept for historical reasons, but its
use is very much discouraged. Use the C<error()> method instead:

    warn $tar->error unless $tar->extract;

Note that in older versions of this module, the C<error()> method
would return an effectively global value even when called an instance
method as above. This has since been fixed, and multiple instances of
C<Archive::Tar> now have separate error strings.

=head2 $Archive::Tar::INSECURE_EXTRACT_MODE

This variable indicates whether C<Archive::Tar> should allow
files to be extracted outside their current working directory.

Allowing this could have security implications, as a malicious
tar archive could alter or replace any file the extracting user
has permissions to. Therefor, the default is to not allow
insecure extractions.

If you trust the archive, or have other reasons to allow the
archive to write files outside your current working directory,
set this variable to C<true>.

Note that this is a backwards incompatible change from version
C<1.36> and before.

=head2 $Archive::Tar::HAS_PERLIO

This variable holds a boolean indicating if we currently have
C<perlio> support loaded. This will be enabled for any perl
greater than C<5.8> compiled with C<perlio>.

If you feel strongly about disabling it, set this variable to
C<false>. Note that you will then need C<IO::String> installed
to support writing stringified archives.

Don't change this variable unless you B<really> know what you're
doing.

=head2 $Archive::Tar::HAS_IO_STRING

This variable holds a boolean indicating if we currently have
C<IO::String> support loaded. This will be enabled for any perl
that has a loadable C<IO::String> module.

If you feel strongly about disabling it, set this variable to
C<false>. Note that you will then need C<perlio> support from
your perl to be able to  write stringified archives.

Don't change this variable unless you B<really> know what you're
doing.

=head2 $Archive::Tar::ZERO_PAD_NUMBERS

This variable holds a boolean indicating if we will create
zero padded numbers for C<size>, C<mtime> and C<checksum>.
The default is C<0>, indicating that we will create space padded
numbers. Added for compatibility with C<busybox> implementations.

=head2 Tuning the way RESOLVE_SYMLINK will works

	You can tune the behaviour by setting the $Archive::Tar::RESOLVE_SYMLINK variable,
	or $ENV{PERL5_AT_RESOLVE_SYMLINK} before loading the module Archive::Tar.

  Values can be one of the following:

		none
           Disable this mechanism and failed as it was in previous version (<1.88)

		speed (default)
           If you prefer speed
           this will read again the whole archive using read() so all entries
           will be available

    memory
           If you prefer memory

	Limitation

		It won't work for terminal, pipe or sockets or every non seekable source.

=head1 FAQ

=over 4

=item What's the minimum perl version required to run Archive::Tar?

You will need perl version 5.005_03 or newer.

=item Isn't Archive::Tar slow?

Yes it is. It's pure perl, so it's a lot slower then your C</bin/tar>
However, it's very portable. If speed is an issue, consider using
C</bin/tar> instead.

=item Isn't Archive::Tar heavier on memory than /bin/tar?

Yes it is, see previous answer. Since C<Compress::Zlib> and therefore
C<IO::Zlib> doesn't support C<seek> on their filehandles, there is little
choice but to read the archive into memory.
This is ok if you want to do in-memory manipulation of the archive.

If you just want to extract, use the C<extract_archive> class method
instead. It will optimize and write to disk immediately.

Another option is to use the C<iter> class method to iterate over
the files in the tarball without reading them all in memory at once.

=item Can you lazy-load data instead?

In some cases, yes. You can use the C<iter> class method to iterate
over the files in the tarball without reading them all in memory at once.

=item How much memory will an X kb tar file need?

Probably more than X kb, since it will all be read into memory. If
this is a problem, and you don't need to do in memory manipulation
of the archive, consider using the C<iter> class method, or C</bin/tar>
instead.

=item What do you do with unsupported filetypes in an archive?

C<Unix> has a few filetypes that aren't supported on other platforms,
like C<Win32>. If we encounter a C<hardlink> or C<symlink> we'll just
try to make a copy of the original file, rather than throwing an error.

This does require you to read the entire archive in to memory first,
since otherwise we wouldn't know what data to fill the copy with.
(This means that you cannot use the class methods, including C<iter>
on archives that have incompatible filetypes and still expect things
to work).

For other filetypes, like C<chardevs> and C<blockdevs> we'll warn that
the extraction of this particular item didn't work.

=item I'm using WinZip, or some other non-POSIX client, and files are not being extracted properly!

By default, C<Archive::Tar> is in a completely POSIX-compatible
mode, which uses the POSIX-specification of C<tar> to store files.
For paths greater than 100 characters, this is done using the
C<POSIX header prefix>. Non-POSIX-compatible clients may not support
this part of the specification, and may only support the C<GNU Extended
Header> functionality. To facilitate those clients, you can set the
C<$Archive::Tar::DO_NOT_USE_PREFIX> variable to C<true>. See the
C<GLOBAL VARIABLES> section for details on this variable.

Note that GNU tar earlier than version 1.14 does not cope well with
the C<POSIX header prefix>. If you use such a version, consider setting
the C<$Archive::Tar::DO_NOT_USE_PREFIX> variable to C<true>.

=item How do I extract only files that have property X from an archive?

Sometimes, you might not wish to extract a complete archive, just
the files that are relevant to you, based on some criteria.

You can do this by filtering a list of C<Archive::Tar::File> objects
based on your criteria. For example, to extract only files that have
the string C<foo> in their title, you would use:

    $tar->extract(
        grep { $_->full_path =~ /foo/ } $tar->get_files
    );

This way, you can filter on any attribute of the files in the archive.
Consult the C<Archive::Tar::File> documentation on how to use these
objects.

=item How do I access .tar.Z files?

The C<Archive::Tar> module can optionally use C<Compress::Zlib> (via
the C<IO::Zlib> module) to access tar files that have been compressed
with C<gzip>. Unfortunately tar files compressed with the Unix C<compress>
utility cannot be read by C<Compress::Zlib> and so cannot be directly
accesses by C<Archive::Tar>.

If the C<uncompress> or C<gunzip> programs are available, you can use
one of these workarounds to read C<.tar.Z> files from C<Archive::Tar>

Firstly with C<uncompress>

    use Archive::Tar;

    open F, "uncompress -c $filename |";
    my $tar = Archive::Tar->new(*F);
    ...

and this with C<gunzip>

    use Archive::Tar;

    open F, "gunzip -c $filename |";
    my $tar = Archive::Tar->new(*F);
    ...

Similarly, if the C<compress> program is available, you can use this to
write a C<.tar.Z> file

    use Archive::Tar;
    use IO::File;

    my $fh = new IO::File "| compress -c >$filename";
    my $tar = Archive::Tar->new();
    ...
    $tar->write($fh);
    $fh->close ;

=item How do I handle Unicode strings?

C<Archive::Tar> uses byte semantics for any files it reads from or writes
to disk. This is not a problem if you only deal with files and never
look at their content or work solely with byte strings. But if you use
Unicode strings with character semantics, some additional steps need
to be taken.

For example, if you add a Unicode string like

    # Problem
    $tar->add_data('file.txt', "Euro: \x{20AC}");

then there will be a problem later when the tarfile gets written out
to disk via C<$tar->write()>:

    Wide character in print at .../Archive/Tar.pm line 1014.

The data was added as a Unicode string and when writing it out to disk,
the C<:utf8> line discipline wasn't set by C<Archive::Tar>, so Perl
tried to convert the string to ISO-8859 and failed. The written file
now contains garbage.

For this reason, Unicode strings need to be converted to UTF-8-encoded
bytestrings before they are handed off to C<add_data()>:

    use Encode;
    my $data = "Accented character: \x{20AC}";
    $data = encode('utf8', $data);

    $tar->add_data('file.txt', $data);

A opposite problem occurs if you extract a UTF8-encoded file from a
tarball. Using C<get_content()> on the C<Archive::Tar::File> object
will return its content as a bytestring, not as a Unicode string.

If you want it to be a Unicode string (because you want character
semantics with operations like regular expression matching), you need
to decode the UTF8-encoded content and have Perl convert it into
a Unicode string:

    use Encode;
    my $data = $tar->get_content();

    # Make it a Unicode string
    $data = decode('utf8', $data);

There is no easy way to provide this functionality in C<Archive::Tar>,
because a tarball can contain many files, and each of which could be
encoded in a different way.

=head1 CAVEATS

The AIX tar does not fill all unused space in the tar archive with 0x00.
This sometimes leads to warning messages from C<Archive::Tar>.

  Invalid header block at offset nnn

A fix for that problem is scheduled to be released in the following levels
of AIX, all of which should be coming out in the 4th quarter of 2009:

 AIX 5.3 TL7 SP10
 AIX 5.3 TL8 SP8
 AIX 5.3 TL9 SP5
 AIX 5.3 TL10 SP2

 AIX 6.1 TL0 SP11
 AIX 6.1 TL1 SP7
 AIX 6.1 TL2 SP6
 AIX 6.1 TL3 SP3

The IBM APAR number for this problem is IZ50240 (Reported component ID:
5765G0300 / AIX 5.3). It is possible to get an ifix for that problem.
If you need an ifix please contact your local IBM AIX support.

=head1 TODO

=over 4

=item Check if passed in handles are open for read/write

Currently I don't know of any portable pure perl way to do this.
Suggestions welcome.

=item Allow archives to be passed in as string

Currently, we only allow opened filehandles or filenames, but
not strings. The internals would need some reworking to facilitate
stringified archives.

=item Facilitate processing an opened filehandle of a compressed archive

Currently, we only support this if the filehandle is an IO::Zlib object.
Environments, like apache, will present you with an opened filehandle
to an uploaded file, which might be a compressed archive.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The various C<extract_...> subroutines may be used to
extract a delimited substring, possibly after skipping a
specified prefix string. By default, that prefix is
optional whitespace (C</\s*/>), but you can change it to whatever
you wish (see below).

The substring to be extracted must appear at the
current C<pos> location of the string's variable
(or at index zero, if no C<pos> position is defined).
In other words, the C<extract_...> subroutines I<don't>
extract the first occurrence of a substring anywhere
in a string (like an unanchored regex would). Rather,
they extract an occurrence of the substring appearing
immediately at the current matching position in the
string (like a C<\G>-anchored regex would).

=head2 General behaviour in list contexts

In a list context, all the subroutines return a list, the first three
elements of which are always:

=over 4

=item [0]

The extracted string, including the specified delimiters.
If the extraction fails C<undef> is returned.

=item [1]

The remainder of the input string (i.e. the characters after the
extracted string). On failure, the entire string is returned.

=item [2]

The skipped prefix (i.e. the characters before the extracted string).
On failure, C<undef> is returned.

=back 

Note that in a list context, the contents of the original input text (the first
argument) are not modified in any way. 

However, if the input text was passed in a variable, that variable's
C<pos> value is updated to point at the first character after the
extracted text. That means that in a list context the various
subroutines can be used much like regular expressions. For example:

	while ( $next = (extract_quotelike($text))[0] )
	{
		# process next quote-like (in $next)
	}

=head2 General behaviour in scalar and void contexts

In a scalar context, the extracted string is returned, having first been
removed from the input text. Thus, the following code also processes
each quote-like operation, but actually removes them from $text:

	while ( $next = extract_quotelike($text) )
	{
		# process next quote-like (in $next)
	}

Note that if the input text is a read-only string (i.e. a literal),
no attempt is made to remove the extracted text.

In a void context the behaviour of the extraction subroutines is
exactly the same as in a scalar context, except (of course) that the
extracted substring is not returned.

=head2 A note about prefixes

Prefix patterns are matched without any trailing modifiers (C</gimsox> etc.)
This can bite you if you're expecting a prefix specification like
'.*?(?=<H1>)' to skip everything up to the first <H1> tag. Such a prefix
pattern will only succeed if the <H1> tag is on the current line, since
. normally doesn't match newlines.

To overcome this limitation, you need to turn on /s matching within
the prefix pattern, using the C<(?s)> directive: '(?s).*?(?=<H1>)'

=head2 C<extract_delimited>

The C<extract_delimited> function formalizes the common idiom
of extracting a single-character-delimited substring from the start of
a string. For example, to extract a single-quote delimited string, the
following code is typically used:

	($remainder = $text) =~ s/\A('(\\.|[^'])*')//s;
	$extracted = $1;

but with C<extract_delimited> it can be simplified to:

	($extracted,$remainder) = extract_delimited($text, "'");

C<extract_delimited> takes up to four scalars (the input text, the
delimiters, a prefix pattern to be skipped, and any escape characters)
and extracts the initial substring of the text that
is appropriately delimited. If the delimiter string has multiple
characters, the first one encountered in the text is taken to delimit
the substring.
The third argument specifies a prefix pattern that is to be skipped
(but must be present!) before the substring is extracted.
The final argument specifies the escape character to be used for each
delimiter.

All arguments are optional. If the escape characters are not specified,
every delimiter is escaped with a backslash (C<\>).
If the prefix is not specified, the
pattern C<'\s*'> - optional whitespace - is used. If the delimiter set
is also not specified, the set C</["'`]/> is used. If the text to be processed
is not specified either, C<$_> is used.

In list context, C<extract_delimited> returns a array of three
elements, the extracted substring (I<including the surrounding
delimiters>), the remainder of the text, and the skipped prefix (if
any). If a suitable delimited substring is not found, the first
element of the array is the empty string, the second is the complete
original text, and the prefix returned in the third element is an
empty string.

In a scalar context, just the extracted substring is returned. In
a void context, the extracted substring (and any prefix) are simply
removed from the beginning of the first argument.

Examples:

	# Remove a single-quoted substring from the very beginning of $text:

		$substring = extract_delimited($text, "'", '');

	# Remove a single-quoted Pascalish substring (i.e. one in which
	# doubling the quote character escapes it) from the very
	# beginning of $text:

		$substring = extract_delimited($text, "'", '', "'");

	# Extract a single- or double- quoted substring from the
	# beginning of $text, optionally after some whitespace
	# (note the list context to protect $text from modification):

		($substring) = extract_delimited $text, q{"'};

	# Delete the substring delimited by the first '/' in $text:

		$text = join '', (extract_delimited($text,'/','[^/]*')[2,1];

Note that this last example is I<not> the same as deleting the first
quote-like pattern. For instance, if C<$text> contained the string:

	"if ('./cmd' =~ m/$UNIXCMD/s) { $cmd = $1; }"
	
then after the deletion it would contain:

	"if ('.$UNIXCMD/s) { $cmd = $1; }"

not:

	"if ('./cmd' =~ ms) { $cmd = $1; }"
	
See L<"extract_quotelike"> for a (partial) solution to this problem.

=head2 C<extract_bracketed>

Like C<"extract_delimited">, the C<extract_bracketed> function takes
up to three optional scalar arguments: a string to extract from, a delimiter
specifier, and a prefix pattern. As before, a missing prefix defaults to
optional whitespace and a missing text defaults to C<$_>. However, a missing
delimiter specifier defaults to C<'{}()[]E<lt>E<gt>'> (see below).

C<extract_bracketed> extracts a balanced-bracket-delimited
substring (using any one (or more) of the user-specified delimiter
brackets: '(..)', '{..}', '[..]', or '<..>'). Optionally it will also
respect quoted unbalanced brackets (see below).

A "delimiter bracket" is a bracket in list of delimiters passed as
C<extract_bracketed>'s second argument. Delimiter brackets are
specified by giving either the left or right (or both!) versions
of the required bracket(s). Note that the order in which
two or more delimiter brackets are specified is not significant.

A "balanced-bracket-delimited substring" is a substring bounded by
matched brackets, such that any other (left or right) delimiter
bracket I<within> the substring is also matched by an opposite
(right or left) delimiter bracket I<at the same level of nesting>. Any
type of bracket not in the delimiter list is treated as an ordinary
character.

In other words, each type of bracket specified as a delimiter must be
balanced and correctly nested within the substring, and any other kind of
("non-delimiter") bracket in the substring is ignored.

For example, given the string:

	$text = "{ an '[irregularly :-(] {} parenthesized >:-)' string }";

then a call to C<extract_bracketed> in a list context:

	@result = extract_bracketed( $text, '{}' );

would return:

	( "{ an '[irregularly :-(] {} parenthesized >:-)' string }" , "" , "" )

since both sets of C<'{..}'> brackets are properly nested and evenly balanced.
(In a scalar context just the first element of the array would be returned. In
a void context, C<$text> would be replaced by an empty string.)

Likewise the call in:

	@result = extract_bracketed( $text, '{[' );

would return the same result, since all sets of both types of specified
delimiter brackets are correctly nested and balanced.

However, the call in:

	@result = extract_bracketed( $text, '{([<' );

would fail, returning:

	( undef , "{ an '[irregularly :-(] {} parenthesized >:-)' string }"  );

because the embedded pairs of C<'(..)'>s and C<'[..]'>s are "cross-nested" and
the embedded C<'E<gt>'> is unbalanced. (In a scalar context, this call would
return an empty string. In a void context, C<$text> would be unchanged.)

Note that the embedded single-quotes in the string don't help in this
case, since they have not been specified as acceptable delimiters and are
therefore treated as non-delimiter characters (and ignored).

However, if a particular species of quote character is included in the
delimiter specification, then that type of quote will be correctly handled.
for example, if C<$text> is:

	$text = '<A HREF=">>>>">link</A>';

then

	@result = extract_bracketed( $text, '<">' );

returns:

	( '<A HREF=">>>>">', 'link</A>', "" )

as expected. Without the specification of C<"> as an embedded quoter:

	@result = extract_bracketed( $text, '<>' );

the result would be:

	( '<A HREF=">', '>>>">link</A>', "" )

In addition to the quote delimiters C<'>, C<">, and C<`>, full Perl quote-like
quoting (i.e. q{string}, qq{string}, etc) can be specified by including the
letter 'q' as a delimiter. Hence:

	@result = extract_bracketed( $text, '<q>' );

would correctly match something like this:

	$text = '<leftop: conj /and/ conj>';

See also: C<"extract_quotelike"> and C<"extract_codeblock">.

=head2 C<extract_variable>

C<extract_variable> extracts any valid Perl variable or
variable-involved expression, including scalars, arrays, hashes, array
accesses, hash look-ups, method calls through objects, subroutine calls
through subroutine references, etc.

The subroutine takes up to two optional arguments:

=over 4

=item 1.

A string to be processed (C<$_> if the string is omitted or C<undef>)

=item 2.

A string specifying a pattern to be matched as a prefix (which is to be
skipped). If omitted, optional whitespace is skipped.

=back

On success in a list context, an array of 3 elements is returned. The
elements are:

=over 4

=item [0]

the extracted variable, or variablish expression

=item [1]

the remainder of the input text,

=item [2]

the prefix substring (if any),

=back

On failure, all of these values (except the remaining text) are C<undef>.

In a scalar context, C<extract_variable> returns just the complete
substring that matched a variablish expression. C<undef> is returned on
failure. In addition, the original input text has the returned substring
(and any prefix) removed from it.

In a void context, the input text just has the matched substring (and
any specified prefix) removed.


=head2 C<extract_tagged>

C<extract_tagged> extracts and segments text between (balanced)
specified tags. 

The subroutine takes up to five optional arguments:

=over 4

=item 1.

A string to be processed (C<$_> if the string is omitted or C<undef>)

=item 2.

A string specifying a pattern to be matched as the opening tag.
If the pattern string is omitted (or C<undef>) then a pattern
that matches any standard XML tag is used.

=item 3.

A string specifying a pattern to be matched at the closing tag. 
If the pattern string is omitted (or C<undef>) then the closing
tag is constructed by inserting a C</> after any leading bracket
characters in the actual opening tag that was matched (I<not> the pattern
that matched the tag). For example, if the opening tag pattern
is specified as C<'{{\w+}}'> and actually matched the opening tag 
C<"{{DATA}}">, then the constructed closing tag would be C<"{{/DATA}}">.

=item 4.

A string specifying a pattern to be matched as a prefix (which is to be
skipped). If omitted, optional whitespace is skipped.

=item 5.

A hash reference containing various parsing options (see below)

=back

The various options that can be specified are:

=over 4

=item C<reject =E<gt> $listref>

The list reference contains one or more strings specifying patterns
that must I<not> appear within the tagged text.

For example, to extract
an HTML link (which should not contain nested links) use:

        extract_tagged($text, '<A>', '</A>', undef, {reject => ['<A>']} );

=item C<ignore =E<gt> $listref>

The list reference contains one or more strings specifying patterns
that are I<not> be be treated as nested tags within the tagged text
(even if they would match the start tag pattern).

For example, to extract an arbitrary XML tag, but ignore "empty" elements:

        extract_tagged($text, undef, undef, undef, {ignore => ['<[^>]*/>']} );

(also see L<"gen_delimited_pat"> below).

=item C<fail =E<gt> $str>

The C<fail> option indicates the action to be taken if a matching end
tag is not encountered (i.e. before the end of the string or some
C<reject> pattern matches). By default, a failure to match a closing
tag causes C<extract_tagged> to immediately fail.

However, if the string value associated with <reject> is "MAX", then
C<extract_tagged> returns the complete text up to the point of failure.
If the string is "PARA", C<extract_tagged> returns only the first paragraph
after the tag (up to the first line that is either empty or contains
only whitespace characters).
If the string is "", the the default behaviour (i.e. failure) is reinstated.

For example, suppose the start tag "/para" introduces a paragraph, which then
continues until the next "/endpara" tag or until another "/para" tag is
encountered:

        $text = "/para line 1\n\nline 3\n/para line 4";

        extract_tagged($text, '/para', '/endpara', undef,
                                {reject => '/para', fail => MAX );

        # EXTRACTED: "/para line 1\n\nline 3\n"

Suppose instead, that if no matching "/endpara" tag is found, the "/para"
tag refers only to the immediately following paragraph:

        $text = "/para line 1\n\nline 3\n/para line 4";

        extract_tagged($text, '/para', '/endpara', undef,
                        {reject => '/para', fail => MAX );

        # EXTRACTED: "/para line 1\n"

Note that the specified C<fail> behaviour applies to nested tags as well.

=back

On success in a list context, an array of 6 elements is returned. The elements are:

=over 4

=item [0]

the extracted tagged substring (including the outermost tags),

=item [1]

the remainder of the input text,

=item [2]

the prefix substring (if any),

=item [3]

the opening tag

=item [4]

the text between the opening and closing tags

=item [5]

the closing tag (or "" if no closing tag was found)

=back

On failure, all of these values (except the remaining text) are C<undef>.

In a scalar context, C<extract_tagged> returns just the complete
substring that matched a tagged text (including the start and end
tags). C<undef> is returned on failure. In addition, the original input
text has the returned substring (and any prefix) removed from it.

In a void context, the input text just has the matched substring (and
any specified prefix) removed.

=head2 C<gen_extract_tagged>

(Note: This subroutine is only available under Perl5.005)

C<gen_extract_tagged> generates a new anonymous subroutine which
extracts text between (balanced) specified tags. In other words,
it generates a function identical in function to C<extract_tagged>.

The difference between C<extract_tagged> and the anonymous
subroutines generated by
C<gen_extract_tagged>, is that those generated subroutines:

=over 4

=item * 

do not have to reparse tag specification or parsing options every time
they are called (whereas C<extract_tagged> has to effectively rebuild
its tag parser on every call);

=item *

make use of the new qr// construct to pre-compile the regexes they use
(whereas C<extract_tagged> uses standard string variable interpolation 
to create tag-matching patterns).

=back

The subroutine takes up to four optional arguments (the same set as
C<extract_tagged> except for the string to be processed). It returns
a reference to a subroutine which in turn takes a single argument (the text to
be extracted from).

In other words, the implementation of C<extract_tagged> is exactly
equivalent to:

        sub extract_tagged
        {
                my $text = shift;
                $extractor = gen_extract_tagged(@_);
                return $extractor->($text);
        }

(although C<extract_tagged> is not currently implemented that way, in order
to preserve pre-5.005 compatibility).

Using C<gen_extract_tagged> to create extraction functions for specific tags 
is a good idea if those functions are going to be called more than once, since
their performance is typically twice as good as the more general-purpose
C<extract_tagged>.


=head2 C<extract_quotelike>

C<extract_quotelike> attempts to recognize, extract, and segment any
one of the various Perl quotes and quotelike operators (see
L<perlop(3)>) Nested backslashed delimiters, embedded balanced bracket
delimiters (for the quotelike operators), and trailing modifiers are
all caught. For example, in:

        extract_quotelike 'q # an octothorpe: \# (not the end of the q!) #'
        
        extract_quotelike '  "You said, \"Use sed\"."  '

        extract_quotelike ' s{([A-Z]{1,8}\.[A-Z]{3})} /\L$1\E/; '

        extract_quotelike ' tr/\\\/\\\\/\\\//ds; '

the full Perl quotelike operations are all extracted correctly.

Note too that, when using the /x modifier on a regex, any comment
containing the current pattern delimiter will cause the regex to be
immediately terminated. In other words:

        'm /
                (?i)            # CASE INSENSITIVE
                [a-z_]          # LEADING ALPHABETIC/UNDERSCORE
                [a-z0-9]*       # FOLLOWED BY ANY NUMBER OF ALPHANUMERICS
           /x'

will be extracted as if it were:

        'm /
                (?i)            # CASE INSENSITIVE
                [a-z_]          # LEADING ALPHABETIC/'

This behaviour is identical to that of the actual compiler.

C<extract_quotelike> takes two arguments: the text to be processed and
a prefix to be matched at the very beginning of the text. If no prefix 
is specified, optional whitespace is the default. If no text is given,
C<$_> is used.

In a list context, an array of 11 elements is returned. The elements are:

=over 4

=item [0]

the extracted quotelike substring (including trailing modifiers),

=item [1]

the remainder of the input text,

=item [2]

the prefix substring (if any),

=item [3]

the name of the quotelike operator (if any),

=item [4]

the left delimiter of the first block of the operation,

=item [5]

the text of the first block of the operation
(that is, the contents of
a quote, the regex of a match or substitution or the target list of a
translation),

=item [6]

the right delimiter of the first block of the operation,

=item [7]

the left delimiter of the second block of the operation
(that is, if it is a C<s>, C<tr>, or C<y>),

=item [8]

the text of the second block of the operation 
(that is, the replacement of a substitution or the translation list
of a translation),

=item [9]

the right delimiter of the second block of the operation (if any),

=item [10]

the trailing modifiers on the operation (if any).

=back

For each of the fields marked "(if any)" the default value on success is
an empty string.
On failure, all of these values (except the remaining text) are C<undef>.

In a scalar context, C<extract_quotelike> returns just the complete substring
that matched a quotelike operation (or C<undef> on failure). In a scalar or
void context, the input text has the same substring (and any specified
prefix) removed.

Examples:

        # Remove the first quotelike literal that appears in text

                $quotelike = extract_quotelike($text,'.*?');

        # Replace one or more leading whitespace-separated quotelike
        # literals in $_ with "<QLL>"

                do { $_ = join '<QLL>', (extract_quotelike)[2,1] } until $@;


        # Isolate the search pattern in a quotelike operation from $text

                ($op,$pat) = (extract_quotelike $text)[3,5];
                if ($op =~ /[ms]/)
                {
                        print "search pattern: $pat\n";
                }
                else
                {
                        print "$op is not a pattern matching operation\n";
                }

=head2 C<extract_quotelike> and "here documents"

C<extract_quotelike> can successfully extract "here documents" from an input
string, but with an important caveat in list contexts.

Unlike other types of quote-like literals, a here document is rarely
a contiguous substring. For example, a typical piece of code using
here document might look like this:

        <<'EOMSG' || die;
        This is the message.
        EOMSG
        exit;

Given this as an input string in a scalar context, C<extract_quotelike>
would correctly return the string "<<'EOMSG'\nThis is the message.\nEOMSG",
leaving the string " || die;\nexit;" in the original variable. In other words,
the two separate pieces of the here document are successfully extracted and
concatenated.

In a list context, C<extract_quotelike> would return the list

=over 4

=item [0]

"<<'EOMSG'\nThis is the message.\nEOMSG\n" (i.e. the full extracted here document,
including fore and aft delimiters),

=item [1]

" || die;\nexit;" (i.e. the remainder of the input text, concatenated),

=item [2]

"" (i.e. the prefix substring -- trivial in this case),

=item [3]

"<<" (i.e. the "name" of the quotelike operator)

=item [4]

"'EOMSG'" (i.e. the left delimiter of the here document, including any quotes),

=item [5]

"This is the message.\n" (i.e. the text of the here document),

=item [6]

"EOMSG" (i.e. the right delimiter of the here document),

=item [7..10]

"" (a here document has no second left delimiter, second text, second right
delimiter, or trailing modifiers).

=back

However, the matching position of the input variable would be set to
"exit;" (i.e. I<after> the closing delimiter of the here document),
which would cause the earlier " || die;\nexit;" to be skipped in any
sequence of code fragment extractions.

To avoid this problem, when it encounters a here document whilst
extracting from a modifiable string, C<extract_quotelike> silently
rearranges the string to an equivalent piece of Perl:

        <<'EOMSG'
        This is the message.
        EOMSG
        || die;
        exit;

in which the here document I<is> contiguous. It still leaves the
matching position after the here document, but now the rest of the line
on which the here document starts is not skipped.

To prevent <extract_quotelike> from mucking about with the input in this way
(this is the only case where a list-context C<extract_quotelike> does so),
you can pass the input variable as an interpolated literal:

        $quotelike = extract_quotelike("$var");

=head2 C<extract_codeblock>

C<extract_codeblock> attempts to recognize and extract a balanced
bracket delimited substring that may contain unbalanced brackets
inside Perl quotes or quotelike operations. That is, C<extract_codeblock>
is like a combination of C<"extract_bracketed"> and
C<"extract_quotelike">.

C<extract_codeblock> takes the same initial three parameters as C<extract_bracketed>:
a text to process, a set of delimiter brackets to look for, and a prefix to
match first. It also takes an optional fourth parameter, which allows the
outermost delimiter brackets to be specified separately (see below).

Omitting the first argument (input text) means process C<$_> instead.
Omitting the second argument (delimiter brackets) indicates that only C<'{'> is to be used.
Omitting the third argument (prefix argument) implies optional whitespace at the start.
Omitting the fourth argument (outermost delimiter brackets) indicates that the
value of the second argument is to be used for the outermost delimiters.

Once the prefix an dthe outermost opening delimiter bracket have been
recognized, code blocks are extracted by stepping through the input text and
trying the following alternatives in sequence:

=over 4

=item 1.

Try and match a closing delimiter bracket. If the bracket was the same
species as the last opening bracket, return the substring to that
point. If the bracket was mismatched, return an error.

=item 2.

Try to match a quote or quotelike operator. If found, call
C<extract_quotelike> to eat it. If C<extract_quotelike> fails, return
the error it returned. Otherwise go back to step 1.

=item 3.

Try to match an opening delimiter bracket. If found, call
C<extract_codeblock> recursively to eat the embedded block. If the
recursive call fails, return an error. Otherwise, go back to step 1.

=item 4.

Unconditionally match a bareword or any other single character, and
then go back to step 1.

=back

Examples:

        # Find a while loop in the text

                if ($text =~ s/.*?while\s*\{/{/)
                {
                        $loop = "while " . extract_codeblock($text);
                }

        # Remove the first round-bracketed list (which may include
        # round- or curly-bracketed code blocks or quotelike operators)

                extract_codeblock $text, "(){}", '[^(]*';


The ability to specify a different outermost delimiter bracket is useful
in some circumstances. For example, in the Parse::RecDescent module,
parser actions which are to be performed only on a successful parse
are specified using a C<E<lt>defer:...E<gt>> directive. For example:

        sentence: subject verb object
                        <defer: {$::theVerb = $item{verb}} >

Parse::RecDescent uses C<extract_codeblock($text, '{}E<lt>E<gt>')> to extract the code
within the C<E<lt>defer:...E<gt>> directive, but there's a problem.

A deferred action like this:

                        <defer: {if ($count>10) {$count--}} >

will be incorrectly parsed as:

                        <defer: {if ($count>

because the "less than" operator is interpreted as a closing delimiter.

But, by extracting the directive using
S<C<extract_codeblock($text, '{}', undef, 'E<lt>E<gt>')>>
the '>' character is only treated as a delimited at the outermost
level of the code block, so the directive is parsed correctly.

=head2 C<extract_multiple>

The C<extract_multiple> subroutine takes a string to be processed and a 
list of extractors (subroutines or regular expressions) to apply to that string.

In an array context C<extract_multiple> returns an array of substrings
of the original string, as extracted by the specified extractors.
In a scalar context, C<extract_multiple> returns the first
substring successfully extracted from the original string. In both
scalar and void contexts the original string has the first successfully
extracted substring removed from it. In all contexts
C<extract_multiple> starts at the current C<pos> of the string, and
sets that C<pos> appropriately after it matches.

Hence, the aim of of a call to C<extract_multiple> in a list context
is to split the processed string into as many non-overlapping fields as
possible, by repeatedly applying each of the specified extractors
to the remainder of the string. Thus C<extract_multiple> is
a generalized form of Perl's C<split> subroutine.

The subroutine takes up to four optional arguments:

=over 4

=item 1.

A string to be processed (C<$_> if the string is omitted or C<undef>)

=item 2.

A reference to a list of subroutine references and/or qr// objects and/or
literal strings and/or hash references, specifying the extractors
to be used to split the string. If this argument is omitted (or
C<undef>) the list:

        [
                sub { extract_variable($_[0], '') },
                sub { extract_quotelike($_[0],'') },
                sub { extract_codeblock($_[0],'{}','') },
        ]

is used.

=item 3.

An number specifying the maximum number of fields to return. If this
argument is omitted (or C<undef>), split continues as long as possible.

If the third argument is I<N>, then extraction continues until I<N> fields
have been successfully extracted, or until the string has been completely 
processed.

Note that in scalar and void contexts the value of this argument is 
automatically reset to 1 (under C<-w>, a warning is issued if the argument 
has to be reset).

=item 4.

A value indicating whether unmatched substrings (see below) within the
text should be skipped or returned as fields. If the value is true,
such substrings are skipped. Otherwise, they are returned.

=back

The extraction process works by applying each extractor in
sequence to the text string.

If the extractor is a subroutine it is called in a list context and is
expected to return a list of a single element, namely the extracted
text. It may optionally also return two further arguments: a string
representing the text left after extraction (like $' for a pattern
match), and a string representing any prefix skipped before the
extraction (like $` in a pattern match). Note that this is designed
to facilitate the use of other Text::Balanced subroutines with
C<extract_multiple>. Note too that the value returned by an extractor
subroutine need not bear any relationship to the corresponding substring
of the original text (see examples below).

If the extractor is a precompiled regular expression or a string,
it is matched against the text in a scalar context with a leading
'\G' and the gc modifiers enabled. The extracted value is either
$1 if that variable is defined after the match, or else the
complete match (i.e. $&).

If the extractor is a hash reference, it must contain exactly one element.
The value of that element is one of the
above extractor types (subroutine reference, regular expression, or string).
The key of that element is the name of a class into which the successful
return value of the extractor will be blessed.

If an extractor returns a defined value, that value is immediately
treated as the next extracted field and pushed onto the list of fields.
If the extractor was specified in a hash reference, the field is also
blessed into the appropriate class, 

If the extractor fails to match (in the case of a regex extractor), or returns an empty list or an undefined value (in the case of a subroutine extractor), it is
assumed to have failed to extract.
If none of the extractor subroutines succeeds, then one
character is extracted from the start of the text and the extraction
subroutines reapplied. Characters which are thus removed are accumulated and
eventually become the next field (unless the fourth argument is true, in which
case they are discarded).

For example, the following extracts substrings that are valid Perl variables:

        @fields = extract_multiple($text,
                                   [ sub { extract_variable($_[0]) } ],
                                   undef, 1);

This example separates a text into fields which are quote delimited,
curly bracketed, and anything else. The delimited and bracketed
parts are also blessed to identify them (the "anything else" is unblessed):

        @fields = extract_multiple($text,
                   [
                        { Delim => sub { extract_delimited($_[0],q{'"}) } },
                        { Brack => sub { extract_bracketed($_[0],'{}') } },
                   ]);

This call extracts the next single substring that is a valid Perl quotelike
operator (and removes it from $text):

        $quotelike = extract_multiple($text,
                                      [
                                        sub { extract_quotelike($_[0]) },
                                      ], undef, 1);

Finally, here is yet another way to do comma-separated value parsing:

        @fields = extract_multiple($csv_text,
                                  [
                                        sub { extract_delimited($_[0],q{'"}) },
                                        qr/([^,]+)(.*)/,
                                  ],
                                  undef,1);

The list in the second argument means:
I<"Try and extract a ' or " delimited string, otherwise extract anything up to a comma...">.
The undef third argument means:
I<"...as many times as possible...">,
and the true value in the fourth argument means
I<"...discarding anything else that appears (i.e. the commas)">.

If you wanted the commas preserved as separate fields (i.e. like split
does if your split pattern has capturing parentheses), you would
just make the last parameter undefined (or remove it).

=head2 C<gen_delimited_pat>

The C<gen_delimited_pat> subroutine takes a single (string) argument and
   > builds a Friedl-style optimized regex that matches a string delimited
by any one of the characters in the single argument. For example:

        gen_delimited_pat(q{'"})

returns the regex:

        (?:\"(?:\\\"|(?!\").)*\"|\'(?:\\\'|(?!\').)*\')

Note that the specified delimiters are automatically quotemeta'd.

A typical use of C<gen_delimited_pat> would be to build special purpose tags
for C<extract_tagged>. For example, to properly ignore "empty" XML elements
(which might contain quoted strings):

        my $empty_tag = '<(' . gen_delimited_pat(q{'"}) . '|.)+/>';

        extract_tagged($text, undef, undef, undef, {ignore => [$empty_tag]} );

C<gen_delimited_pat> may also be called with an optional second argument,
which specifies the "escape" character(s) to be used for each delimiter.
For example to match a Pascal-style string (where ' is the delimiter
and '' is a literal ' within the string):

        gen_delimited_pat(q{'},q{'});

Different escape characters can be specified for different delimiters.
For example, to specify that '/' is the escape for single quotes
and '%' is the escape for double quotes:

        gen_delimited_pat(q{'"},q{/%});

If more delimiters than escape chars are specified, the last escape char
is used for the remaining delimiters.
If no escape char is specified for a given specified delimiter, '\' is used.

=head2 C<delimited_pat>

Note that C<gen_delimited_pat> was previously called C<delimited_pat>.
That name may still be used, but is now deprecated.
        

=head1 DIAGNOSTICS

In a list context, all the functions return C<(undef,$original_text)>
on failure. In a scalar context, failure is indicated by returning C<undef>
(in this case the input text is not modified in any way).

In addition, on failure in I<any> context, the C<$@> variable is set.
Accessing C<$@-E<gt>{error}> returns one of the error diagnostics listed
below.
Accessing C<$@-E<gt>{pos}> returns the offset into the original string at
which the error was detected (although not necessarily where it occurred!)
Printing C<$@> directly produces the error message, with the offset appended.
On success, the C<$@> variable is guaranteed to be C<undef>.

The available diagnostics are:

=over 4

=item  C<Did not find a suitable bracket: "%s">

The delimiter provided to C<extract_bracketed> was not one of
C<'()[]E<lt>E<gt>{}'>.

=item  C<Did not find prefix: /%s/>

A non-optional prefix was specified but wasn't found at the start of the text.

=item  C<Did not find opening bracket after prefix: "%s">

C<extract_bracketed> or C<extract_codeblock> was expecting a
particular kind of bracket at the start of the text, and didn't find it.

=item  C<No quotelike operator found after prefix: "%s">

C<extract_quotelike> didn't find one of the quotelike operators C<q>,
C<qq>, C<qw>, C<qx>, C<s>, C<tr> or C<y> at the start of the substring
it was extracting.

=item  C<Unmatched closing bracket: "%c">

C<extract_bracketed>, C<extract_quotelike> or C<extract_codeblock> encountered
a closing bracket where none was expected.

=item  C<Unmatched opening bracket(s): "%s">

C<extract_bracketed>, C<extract_quotelike> or C<extract_codeblock> ran 
out of characters in the text before closing one or more levels of nested
brackets.

=item C<Unmatched embedded quote (%s)>

C<extract_bracketed> attempted to match an embedded quoted substring, but
failed to find a closing quote to match it.

=item C<Did not find closing delimiter to match '%s'>

C<extract_quotelike> was unable to find a closing delimiter to match the
one that opened the quote-like operation.

=item  C<Mismatched closing bracket: expected "%c" but found "%s">

C<extract_bracketed>, C<extract_quotelike> or C<extract_codeblock> found
a valid bracket delimiter, but it was the wrong species. This usually
indicates a nesting error, but may indicate incorrect quoting or escaping.

=item  C<No block delimiter found after quotelike "%s">

C<extract_quotelike> or C<extract_codeblock> found one of the
quotelike operators C<q>, C<qq>, C<qw>, C<qx>, C<s>, C<tr> or C<y>
without a suitable block after it.

=item C<Did not find leading dereferencer>

C<extract_variable> was expecting one of '$', '@', or '%' at the start of
a variable, but didn't find any of them.

=item C<Bad identifier after dereferencer>

C<extract_variable> found a '$', '@', or '%' indicating a variable, but that
character was not followed by a legal Perl identifier.

=item C<Did not find expected opening bracket at %s>

C<extract_codeblock> failed to find any of the outermost opening brackets
that were specified.

=item C<Improperly nested codeblock at %s>

A nested code block was found that started with a delimiter that was specified
as being only to be used as an outermost bracket.

=item  C<Missing second block for quotelike "%s">

C<extract_codeblock> or C<extract_quotelike> found one of the
quotelike operators C<s>, C<tr> or C<y> followed by only one block.

=item C<No match found for opening bracket>

C<extract_codeblock> failed to find a closing bracket to match the outermost
opening bracket.

=item C<Did not find opening tag: /%s/>

C<extract_tagged> did not find a suitable opening tag (after any specified
prefix was removed).

=item C<Unable to construct closing tag to match: /%s/>

C<extract_tagged> matched the specified opening tag and tried to
modify the matched text to produce a matching closing tag (because
none was specified). It failed to generate the closing tag, almost
certainly because the opening tag did not start with a
bracket of some kind.

=item C<Found invalid nested tag: %s>

C<extract_tagged> found a nested tag that appeared in the "reject" list
(and the failure mode was not "MAX" or "PARA").

=item C<Found unbalanced nested tag: %s>

C<extract_tagged> found a nested opening tag that was not matched by a
corresponding nested closing tag (and the failure mode was not "MAX" or "PARA").

=item C<Did not find closing tag>

C<extract_tagged> reached the end of the text without finding a closing tag
to match the original opening tag (and the failure mode was not
"MAX" or "PARA").

Pick an image to use for your photo ID.  The image must be a JPEG file.
Remember that the image is stored within your public key.  If you use a
very large picture, your key will become very large as well!
Keeping the image close to 240x288 is a good size to use.

 What keysize do you want for the Authentication key? (%u)  What keysize do you want for the Encryption key? (%u)  What keysize do you want for the Signature key? (%u)  What keysize do you want for the subkey? (%u)  What keysize do you want? (%u)  When you sign a user ID on a key, you should first verify that the key
belongs to the person named in the user ID.  It is useful for others to
know how carefully you verified this.

"0" means you make no particular claim as to how carefully you verified the
    key.

"1" means you believe the key is owned by the person who claims to own it
    but you could not, or did not verify the key at all.  This is useful for
    a "persona" verification, where you sign the key of a pseudonymous user.

"2" means you did casual verification of the key.  For example, this could
    mean that you verified the key fingerprint and checked the user ID on the
    key against a photo ID.

"3" means you did extensive verification of the key.  For example, this could
    mean that you verified the key fingerprint with the owner of the key in
    person, and that you checked, by means of a hard to forge document with a
    photo ID (such as a passport) that the name of the key owner matches the
    name in the user ID on the key, and finally that you verified (by exchange
    of email) that the email address on the key belongs to the key owner.

Note that the examples given above for levels 2 and 3 are *only* examples.
In the end, it is up to you to decide just what "casual" and "extensive"
mean to you when you sign other keys.

If you don't know what the right answer is, answer "0". You are about to revoke these signatures:
 You are using the `%s' character set.
 You can't change the expiration date of a v3 key
 You can't delete the last user ID!
 You did not specify a user ID. (you may use "-r")
 You don't want a passphrase - this is probably a *bad* idea!

 You don't want a passphrase - this is probably a *bad* idea!
I will do it anyway.  You can change your passphrase at any time,
using this program with the option "--edit-key".

 You have signed these user IDs on key %s:
 You may not add a designated revoker to a PGP 2.x-style key.
 You may not add a photo ID to a PGP2-style key.
 You may not make an OpenPGP signature on a PGP 2.x key while in --pgp2 mode.
 You may try to re-create the trustdb using the commands:
 You must select at least one key.
 You must select at least one user ID.
 You must select exactly one key.
 You need a Passphrase to protect your secret key.

 You need a passphrase to unlock the secret key for user:
"%.*s"

 You selected this USER-ID:

 You should specify a reason for the certification.  Depending on the
context you have the ability to choose from this list:
  "Key has been compromised"
      Use this if you have a reason to believe that unauthorized persons
      got access to your secret key.
  "Key is superseded"
      Use this if you have replaced this key with a newer one.
  "Key is no longer used"
      Use this if you have retired this key.
  "User ID is no longer valid"
      Use this to state that the user ID should not longer be used;

(%u)  What keysize do you want for the subkey? (%u)  What keysize do you want? (%u)  When you sign a user ID on a key, you should first verify that the key
belongs to the person named in the user ID.  It is useful for others to
know how carefully you verified this.

0 means you make no particular claim as to how carefully you verified the
    key.

1 means you believe the key is owned by the person who claims to own it
    but you could not, or did not verify the key at all.  This is useful for
    a persona verification, where you sign the key of a pseudonymous user.

2 means you did casual verification of the key.  For example, this could
    mean that you verified the key fingerprint and checked the user ID on the
    key against a photo ID.

3 means you did extensive verification of the key.  For example, this could
    mean that you verified the key fingerprint with the owner of the key in
    person, and that you checked, by means of a hard to forge document with a
    photo ID (such as a passport) that the name of the key owner matches the
    name in the user ID on the key, and finally that you verified (by exchange
    of email) that the email address on the key belongs to the key owner.

Note that the examples given above for levels 2 and 3 are *only* examples.
In the end, it is up to you to decide just what casual and extensive
mean to you when you sign other keys.
